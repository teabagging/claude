Over the past five years, I have become around 50 pounds overweight and all of my attempts to lose have seemed to fail so I have given up, but my weight has stayed the same. There is so much information put there about losing weight with hypothyroidism but it all seems to conflict. I am so unsure as to what type of exercise and diet I should follow as a result but I still would like to lose weight, but most importantly have my body feel better. What can I do? I am currently on Levothyroxine, Buspar, and Benedryl.","Doctor":"Hi. You have really done well with the hypothyroidism problem. Your levels are normal with less medications which are very good. As it is genetically induced, it is very difficult to lose weight. My advice to you is, you should focus on maintaining normal levels of TSH (thyroid-stimulating hormone) and try to remain active, having a positive outlook in life. Or else, it will become very difficult to balance your life with the symptoms of hypothyroidism. Even though your weight has not reduced, be very careful in not putting on weight here afterward. Everyday brisk walking for 1 hour. If you have body pain, alternate with exercises and walking. Avoid all kinds of junk foods, processed, bakery products, rich sweets, fatty foods, sodas, alcohol, and smoking. Avoid partying and binge eating. Follow the food timings properly. Have small frequent meals. In between snacks should be strictly fruits or any kind of low-calorie foods. Have unsalted nuts around five daily. It can give a glow to your dry skin. Everyday water intake should be around 1.5-2 liters. You can use flax seeds. Powder it and mix it in your food. It is a fiber which will give you fullness. Use turmeric, fenugreek seeds, or powder every day. It is a good antioxidant and fenugreek helps in reducing cholesterol levels. Include low-fat milk, curd every day. Egg white, lean chicken, or fish can be taken daily in moderation (anyone). Organ meats need to be avoided. Is your menstrual cycle normal? Please get back if you have any other complaints. Follow up after 15 days."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor! I used to have clear skin but since I moved to a new place, I started to have lots of acne on my face particularly on my forehead. I thought it would disappear once I went back home, but it only got worse. I did some research and assumed that it was caused by drinking too much cow's milk, but it has been since since I stopped and they would still not go away. I also noticed that I get deep acne whenever I'm nearing my period, along with the usual small red bumps. I bought an acne soap and have been using it for a month now but I'm not sure if it works. I hope you can help me because it has been affecting my mental state lately :((((","Doctor":"Hi there Acne has multifactorial etiology. Only acne soap does not improve if ypu have grade 2 or more grade acne. You need to have oral and topical medications. This before writing medicines i need to confirm your grade of acne. For mild grade topical clindamycin or retenoic acud derivative would suffice whereas for higher grade acne you need oral medicines aluke doxycycline azithromycin or isotretinoin.

Right now I have no pain or tender near that area still relief but curious on what happened and why I got this shock and that popping feeling so loud it scared me half to death.","Doctor":"Hello. The popping and discomfort what you felt is either because of improper scapulothoracic mobility or may be due to facet joint irritation in the neck with intervertebral hypermobility. Which could have caused due to stiffness in the chest muscles, shoulder stiffness, etc.  I would recommend you to do a lot of icing in the chest and back muscles. Maintain your neck and upper back posture by doing some back retraction work. Gently stretch your neck and chest. Gently massage your chest and shoulders to relieve tension in the muscles. I hope this is helpful for now. Kindly revert in case you need any help in this regard."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor,Before two years had sex with a call girl in a dark location for about 10 to15 min. I did not eject, and I am sure that she did not eject as well (not 100 % sure). Do not know if the condom broke (as it was dark) but had some liquid on my penis (maybe fluid in condom, not sure) After few days from then I had cold followed by itchy skin. I took medicine from the doctor and got it resolved.After a few weeks from then, I had fever 100 F, mild night sweats, mild sore throat, slight weight loss (around four to five kg). Also I feel tired most of times. After 50 days, I got an HIV blood test, which came out negative. Do not know the name of the test, they took blood from my fingertip, tested it using some chemical for 40 minutes, and gave a report. Doctor suggested me get the same test after three months. Now I took medicines for flu symptoms which are giving me relief. But, very worried about the situation. Will medicine I used for cold and itchy skin have impact on HIV. Was the test enough for diagnosis as I do not know the name like fourth-generation etc. Also I washed my penis after 20 minutes with water thoroughly. Please help.","Doctor":"Hello. The HIV test uses a finger prick blood sample, with results given within 20 minutes, and is 99 % accurate at detecting any HIV exposure that may have occurred more than 12 weeks ago. However, it can potentially pick up HIV infection from as little as four weeks ago. There is nothing to worry nothing will happen, and please repeat your test after 12 weeks. If you want accurate results to get, it has done RNA PCR which will give actual results within 10days. Antigen detection like P24 gives best results with in two to four weeks. Probably your suffering from a simple viral upper respiratory infection. After 12 weeks, please consult your doctor he will examine and treat you accordingly."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor,I had an emergency surgery six months ago punched through a window right arm cut both arteries cut radial nerve with ulnar damage and cut bicep tendon nerves back now almost full thumbs up the only issue is bicep.

PS pronator is still little and has not fully recovered.","Doctor":"Hello. If you are saying it is already six months since the surgery and if you are doing regular physiotherapy, still has not gained much of the actions, then it is not worth waiting anymore. There are many muscle transfer surgeries which can give you the desired movements and help you in day today activities. But you have to remember that post such operations you will require time to train the brain and get the full use of such movements. That will take time. Do not want to demotivate you, but tremendous training and hard work might be required to reach the pre trauma stage of your boxing."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, My culture from my gynecologist came back, showing that I have a yeast infection as well as Beta Strep. I was hoping for more information on Beta Strep. I have never heard of it, and there is a lot of information when I searched that is making me confused a little. I am not experiencing any symptoms, either. I feel perfectly fine.","Doctor":"Hello. There are lots of bacteria and other organisms that colonize healthy skin. Yeast a fungus also is a commensal in our body. Just the presence of these organisms is of no significance. The colony count is needed, which is high, will need a course of antibiotics, which can be decided by culture and sensitivity. But after a surgery like what you had, or any significant stress or use of lots of antibiotics (as would have happened after surgery) or use of steroids or diabetes, all infections show an altered balance between good and bad bacteria. You do not need any treatment for this. Just wait for your body to develop those good bacteria, and gradually, all tests will come negative. If you have any symptoms, treat as per need. Avoid unnecessary antibiotics use. They will further delay the recovery. I hope I have clarified your query, do write back if any more questions."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor,I am 24 years old, and for the past nine years, I am facing hair fall problem nowadays my 60 % of hair is falling on my top and front of my head.

Do you know if your father also differed from hair loss issue at this young age? Did you suffer from severe health issues or chronic illnesses? If you do not think above mentioned is the cause for your hair fall, then the only reason I can think is that you have been going through severe stress which has taken a toll on your health. Homeopathy would be a good option in this case as it will cure our problem from the root cause, and there will be no side effects. So to prescribe you a correct homeopathic remedy I need to understand your mental, emotional, and physical state. He ce I need detail case history which can be done either through face to face consultation or online consultation. I would advise you to visit a good homeopath for consultation.

I had gone through your question, and I can understand your concern. If the pain occurs only when you eat food and it gets stuck into it, it is reversible pulpitis. For that, you do not need to get it extracted. You need to get it filled, and it will cost you less than that of pulling (extraction). Second, you will save your tooth too. My suggestion is to get dental filling done as soon as possible. If you want to get it removed, you need to visit a doctor (dentist), and there will be no pain because during extraction local anesthesia is given."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, My reverse elbow armpits have developed a darker (my skin color is fair) pigmentation.

Regarding my medical history, I am a premature baby of seven months. As told by my mom and relatives, I remained alive on medicines with great difficulty. And also from childhood, I used to get skin diseases frequently, and for that, I think I was regularly administered antibiotics.","Doctor":"Hello. I need to know a few things, 1. Do you feel feverish, or does the thermometer record a temperature? 2. What other symptoms do you get? Runny or blocked nose, sore throat, throat pain with swallowing, headaches, body pains, etc. 3. Does anyone else around you (family members, co-workers, etc.) develop similar symptoms before or after you do? 4. Do you get any tests done like blood tests or X-rays during those episodes? From your description, it appears that you are getting frequent viral upper respiratory tract infections. These are acquired from other patients through the air (coughing, sneezing, etc.). They are usually short-lived and last no more than five to seven days. Since more than 300 different viruses can cause similar symptoms, you can get infected multiple times each time with a different virus. The same virus cannot affect you again. Unfortunately, antibiotics do not work against viruses. They are meant for bacterial infections only. However, doctors continue to prescribe antibiotics unnecessarily, and this has led to the emergence of widespread bacterial resistance.  Other than symptomatic treatment, no medicine can cure or prevent these infections. They are self-limited, and you will get better even if you do not take any medication. The older you get, the less frequently you will get these infections as your body will be building up defenses with every disease. No household tips or vitamin supplements have been proven to work. Premature birth can lead to increased frequency of infections, but unless the infections are bacterial, not much can be done about them. Please get back to me with answers to the above questions and also attach any test reports you may have."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I am a 40 year old female.

The condition you have described is called proptosis. The most common cause of proptosis is thyroid abnormality (hyperthyroidism) and called thyroid eye disease (TED).

During this time the actual cause is treated (hyperthyroidism) and for proptosis steroids may be given (that you have already taken). Enlarged muscles can compress the optic nerve and can cause permanent vision loss. So you need to consult an endocrinologist for the treatment of thyroid abnormality.

Her symptoms have developed most significantly over the past few months, and include depression, weakness, constant light-headedness, shortness of breath (even when sitting still), difficulty taking a deep breath (causes pain), episodes where breathing becomes especially difficult, a complete lack of energy, continual exhaustion, continual muscle soreness (especially in the calves), cold hands and feet (to the point of turning blue), intolerance to cold and heat especially, episodes of a racing heartbeat, and episodes of anxiety and disorientation. At first our focus was on her was depression but now our focus is shifting toward her problems with physical activity and breathing, especially as she has now come to the point where she can no longer participate in any sports. We have seen a psychiatrist for her depression who discovered the MTHFR Mutation, which has since been addressed with a megadose of methyl folate.

We have put her on various vitamin B supplements and have made sure she is getting proper nutrition and rest. Again, nothing has helped. Other labwork, as well as some of her symptoms, has made us consider her thyroid. The thyroid results are as follows:  TSH: 0.059 ulU/ml. AntioTPO-Ab: 84.9 IU/mL. Anti-Thyroglobulin: 134 IU/mL. Total T3: 130 ng/dL. T4: 10.5 ug/dL. Other labs that were out of the normal range are as follows:  - Ferritin: 31 ng/mL (her other iron results were normal). - Differential (Audo Diff) Neutrophils: 66%. In spite of a low TSH we have been told that as long as the T4 level is within normal range there is no need for attention with the thyroid. Yet, I canno help but keep coming back to the thyroid and wonder if this is not where we should focus our efforts. Any thoughts please?","Doctor":"Hi, It is really sad to know about your daughter. 1. As a matter of fact your daughter seems to have acute thyroiditis. Though the thyroid profile has not shown full blown thyrotoxic state, she has subclinical hyperthyroidism with TSH being suppressed. Since how long has she been like this? Thyroiditis might take 8-12 weeks to settle. How old are the reports? Thyroiditis might leave the patient hypothyroid. 2. Secondly she is 15, puberty is another phase of major hormonal and emotional change over. How are her periods? Has she put on weight? or lost some? You have supplemented with multivitamins, please see if B12 upto 1500 mcg is being given and Vitamin D 1000 IU daily or 60,000 IU once a week is going. Also supplement her with calcium and magnesium and check these levels as well. Treat her with Propranolol 10mg twice a day to beat the anxiety and palpitations.

However, he also did prostatic acid phosphatase test which was high at 4.5 ng/mL. My question is whether prostatic acid phosphatase test is valid for screening or not? Should I need to do these tests again? I had prostatitis symptoms in the past. Now, it seems to be fine.","Doctor":"Hi. I have gone through your query. Prostatic acid phosphatase (PAP) has been replaced by PSA (prostate-specific antigen test). It is better in the detection of prostate cancer compared to PAP. The elevation of PAP levels alone is not a cause for concern. I hope your treating doctor has done a rectal exam to find out any prostate nodules. If it is normal, then it is not necessary to repeat the tests. Hope this helps you. Feel free to revert back with any questions.

I reviewed PSA test results and apparently I have one abnormal reading out of three. PSA total 0.5, PSA free 0.1, PSA % free 20. The PSA % free 20 is in red indicating abnormal. What does this mean? What causes it to be abnormal?","Doctor":"Hi. Free PSA should be more than 15 % to rule out prostate cancer. Free PSA is an additional tool used when PSA is above 2.5 and we want to check whether high PSA is due to benign prostate growth or due to prostate cancer. Some laboratories use 25 % cutoff, but most have 15 % cutoff value. Since your total PSA is quite low and free PSA is above 15 %, you should not worry. If in doubt, repeat after a few months."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I am 27 years old. I am worried about my prostate as my grandfather had prostate cancer and my father had an enlargement but was already cured. I had an ultrasound last year due to frequent urinating and result showed minimal calcification a year back. The Radiologist told me that the calcification has nothing to worry as it was not that serious and my doctor (internal medicine) also did not care about it. But I am still worried as what I have read is that even at a young age you can have prostate cancer. Though I am still experiencing frequent urination (I am now drinking a lot of water 2 to 3 liters a day) now, my creatinine is in normal level and KUB is all normal.","Doctor":"Hi. I have gone through your query. It is extremely unlikely for you to develop prostate cancer at your age. Even in families with hereditary prostate cancer, the usual age people develop cancer is above 40 years of age at the lowest, though it is usually between 50 to 60 years. That said, in your case, it is too early to jump to conclusions of having prostate cancer in your family. The most likely explanation for your symptoms could be a mild urinary tract infection or even your increased fluid intake. Prostatic calcification is commonly seen and does not imply anything significant to worry now. If you are concerned, you can do a PSA (prostate-specific antigen) test and a prostate exam at 40 years. If normal, then you can repeat it after three years interval. For more information consult an urologist online -->"},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am a 79 year old male. Excellent health, take no medications with the exception of an occasional Viagra. In a recent DRE, my urologist discovered two small nodules on my prostate. A PSA at the time was 6.3. Over the years, I have ranged in 2's and 3's. He suggested a biopsy of the prostate. I have read many negative things about this process. I have also read about nonevasive procedures to detect for cancer.","Doctor":"Hi. I have gone through your query. I concur with your urologist in the need for a biopsy. Any PSA (prostate-specific antigen) more than 4 or abnormal findings on DRE (digital rectal examination) needs evaluation to rule out prostate cancer. None of the non-invasive techniques are sufficiently accurate as a biopsy at present. The closest is an MRI which, if positive, needs to be confirmed by a biopsy, and if negative does not exactly rule out a malignancy, you will need a biopsy nevertheless. Many blood tests are available but those are only if the DRE is normal and will not be applicable in your situation. Hope this was helpful, feel free to revert back with any other questions.

Again after three months, I redid the test, but even this time, the result was negative. I was not satisfied, so I went for ELISA test, and again the results came back negative. I consulted two general physicians, who told me that I do not have HIV. But, I am still worried because of the symptoms that I have. I am a male, who weighs 62 kg, and I am 6 feet tall. The symptoms i'm having are:  severe weakness, ulcers in mouth and tongue, fatigue, pain in legs while sleeping, itching in the private part, occasional sore throat, occasional itching and pain in ears, and black spots on my back.  I remember having loose motions after a week of unprotected sex. At that time, the doctor told me that I have food poisoning, and I was alright after taking medicines. Are these HIV tests done by me reliable? Was the loose motion caused due to HIV? Is it possible that my immune system was so weak to detect antibodies during my HIV test? Should I go for another test such as PCR RNA test? Please help me, I am worried. Your kind response will be appreciated. Thank you.","Doctor":"Hi. The test kits used to diagnose HIV are highly sensitive and specific and gives accurate results. The majority of the people who are infected with HIV (human immunodeficiency virus) develop antibodies by three months, and even in the rare instances of late seroconversions, they develop HIV antibodies by six months. You can rely on your HIV screening test results. If there had been no other exposure other than that, you do not require any further test. The symptoms which you mentioned could be due to various reasons and cannot be attributed to HIV. In fact, there are no specific symptoms or signs which can lead to the diagnosis of HIV. As per the above information, you are HIV negative. Just relax. Hope your query is answered, but if you have any other query, please do not hesitate to ask or call anytime. Best wishes.

Most of the persons who are over-possessive of their partner show certain kinds of behavior that is uncommon in the general population. They feel less secure and this sense of insecurity is the driving force for the over-possessive nature. Someone who is insecure may doubt their partner's dedication and may, therefore, try to control them. In short, they feel vulnerable and will do anything to make sure they are not hurt.

Unfortunately what your doctor has said is right. Spotting in early pregnancy is normal. But a fall or no rise beta HCG is a poor sign. Beta hCG is a hormone produced from fetal tissue. At a level of 25 mIU/mL urine test is positive it doubles in 48 hours. So if the result of 7th is 125, then on 9th it should have been around 250 or more. Only healthy fetal tissue can produce an adequate amount of this hormone, so indirectly we get to know the health of the embryo even without seeing it. So it just means the fetal tissue is not growing. There can be lab errors, so to be on a safer side doctor has asked you to come for scan, to confirm.  If you are worried about the repeated miscarriages, have yourself and your partner checked for any problem.

This kind of chest pain occurs during stress and anxiety only. We label them nonspecific cardiac chest pain. But, we should always keep in consideration cardiac chest pain and acid reflux. It is important to differentiate between the all. However, the cardiac chest pain is severe and crushing in nature. It increases on activity like walking and exercising. It also gets radiated to left arm. Since your ECG and other cardiac workup are normal, the pain is not due to cardiac issues. For acid reflux, I would advise you to take a combination of Pantoprazole and Domperidone once a day. Your increase in heart rate might be possibly because of anxiety only.

Sexual feelings in an adult towards a female are considered as normal and acceptable.

This might result in difficulty in maintaining relationship with any other female. To overcome the problem you have to work hard. One thing is that stop watching porn completely. If that is not possible at this moment then watch videos only and avoid going to forums or reading stories of incest online. Such things increase the perversions. Avoid watching any material that relates to incest. I am not saying that you should stop masturbating but stop thinking about incest. You are having guilty after incest ideas, so most likely these are intrusive ideas and should be treated also. If possible visit a psychiatrist for help. Medicines like Paroxetine or Fluoxetine can help to control your intrusive ideas and you will feel better. These are safe medicines. Spend your time in outdoor activities.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method.

I am not shy and I do not have stage fear. When I meet my friends or when I am giving presentations at college, I am the one who used to stay very confident. However, some days back, when I was talking to myself in front of the mirror, my mom questioned me. Until now I did not pay much attention to what I was doing. But, ever since my mom saw me doing that I have become conscious. I have stopped talking to myself for two to three days. But, I do not feel like I have been missing out on anything. I am still friendly and confident. But, I am just wondering if I have crossed the line of sanity. I searched about this on the internet and came across something called as schizophrenia. Is this disorder setting with my habit? Do I have schizophrenia or any other disorder? To be honest, after reading about this schizophrenia I am very scared. It sounds like a very serious disorder to me. Please help.","Doctor":"Hi. I read your query with keen interest and understand your concerns. From the available description, I do not think you have crossed the limit of sanity or you developed schizophrenia. Schizophrenia is altogether very different disorder where people have abnormal perceptions such as hearing voices when no one is present and seeing objects when nothing is there. I do not see any of them with you. In my view, you need to put your worries at rest and do what your mind and heart considers right. It may be abnormal for your mother, but there is no pathology with this. If you feel more assistance is required or my answer to your query is far from setting down the worries, then it is better to see a psychiatrist in person.

Four months back, I had a sexual encounter with two female partners. I had insertive vaginal sex and received oral sex. Intercourse had lasted for about five minutes twice with each partner. Condoms were used throughout and were changed for every partner. I do not recall any of the condoms breaking or slipping off completely. About a week or so after the encounter, I experienced some health-related concerns, one after another.I got an eye stye, inside of the eyelid, which was little painful and irritating. It went away in a week. I got a boil, nearly an inch in diameter, in the lower abdomen, which subsided in a week. I also got a white area behind the wisdom tooth. This area was painful during the initial 3 to 4 days, then the pain subsided, and the white area started growing bigger. OPG and clinical examination suggested impacted wisdom tooth and trauma caused by friction of upper and lower wisdom teeth. So, I got both the wisdom teeth extracted. Now, it is normal.I also had a skin tag in the underarm area, which turned painful, hard, and dark purplish. One or two light reddish spots in the adjoining area. They resolved in 7 to 8 days. I have high blood pressure and triglycerides. My triglycerides were 292, which dropped to 195 after 10 days without medication. I got a severe headache one night, which went away next morning. I feel light-headed while walking, staring at the computer, etc., but not when lying down for 5 to 6 days. This happened concurrently with the diagnosis of high triglycerides and BP. I also have diarrhea type condition, that is, I have bowel movements thrice a day, which lasted for 9 to 10 days. My gastroenterologist remarked ‘no abnormalities detected.’ I took antibiotics and other medicines for the dental problem few days before this.I do not have a fever or any unusual skin rash. I do not have unusual body ache or weight loss or loss of appetite. I also do not have any apparent swollen glands. My creatinine and TSH test reports are normal. My LDL is normal, and HDL is little lower than normal. Assuming either of my partners was HIV positive, what is the chance of me contracting his? Does any of the above health concerns related to HIV? Does HIV symptoms, if any, appear together or can appear one after another? What is the most likely period after exposure when symptoms appear, if at all? In other words, is it likely for HIV symptoms to show after 5 to 6 weeks? I realize HIV infection can be confirmed only by a test. However, I sincerely request a prompt and clear response to the above queries, which will help me cut down the fear. Thank you.","Doctor":"Hi.

My period has been fairly regular in the past with them happening 4 days prior or after my date. I have taken emergency morning after pill in the past (thrice in the last 4 months). What could be the reason? Is there a possibility that I could still be pregnant after a negative test, though I have not had any other symptoms of pregnancy nor am I having any sought of discomfort?","Doctor":"Hello. The striking point in your history is that you have taken morning after pill thrice in the last 4 months. It has to be understood that the most common side effect of an emergency contraceptive pill is delaying the next 2-3 menstrual cycles.  As your pregnancy test is negative even after 13 days post period, it clearly indicates that you are not pregnant . Hence, the delay in periods is likely to be due to ipill side effect. Or another possible reason for the delay could be stress induced hormonal imbalance during this menstrual cycle. Stress including emotional, psychological, physical or social disturbances, all have a bearing on the reproductive hormones and can easily delay your menses, once pregnancy is ruled out.  It is suggested that you can wait for another week to allow your menses to resume naturally , if not then you may opt for a withdrawal bleed with progesterone pills to resume your menses.  As pregnancy test is negative, you can rest assured and wait for another week safely.

I do not know that there were sperms in his hand. We did not have sex. But, can I get pregnant in this situation? I missed my periods this month. What is the cause?","Doctor":"Hi. In your case, there is a chance that semen might have entered into the vagina. As you have not done any sexual intercourse, there is less chance of getting pregnant. You have to rule out pregnancy by urine hCG (human chorionic gonadotropin) test. You can do this test at home. If pregnancy is not present, then thyroid problem and diabetes should be ruled out. Excess stress, obesity, prolonged fasting can also lead to a delayed period. You can consult a gynecologist for examination if needed.

There is no abnormal blood and urine finding. I had blood test and it is negative for all infectious diseases such as Lyme, cat scratch, AIDS, etc. Please help with some suggestion. Thank you.","Doctor":"Hi. I assure you not to worry as all things may get settled with proper care and follow-up. 1. Inguinal lymph nodes usually get prominent due to some infection (that you say have been ruled out) or some primary pathology of the nodes themselves.  2. The knots you are talking about also warrants to rule out if that is a vein pathology or lymph nodes can be benign or cancerous changes. Biopsy of the nodes is mandatory especially when there we see changes on ultrasound.  3. Weakness can be due to hemoglobin or red blood cell deficiency. Other causes of weakness may be hypothyroidism or fluid and electrolyte imbalances.  4. Your low sedimentation rate may be due to red blood cell, white blood cell changes and protein abnormality. Sickle cell disease also may cause it. But clinical correlation is the key and for that your physician needs to go for physical examination and if suspicion arises, he may refer you to hematologist.  5. Pain in the lymphatic region can be due to lymph nodes being pressed on or it is possibly from lipomatous changes.  6. I also prefer you to get a detailed heart evaluation from cardiologist as weakness, shoulder and arm issues warrant that too. This kind of symptoms also needs screening for hypertension and diabetes mellitus. Your physician can help you for that too.  7. If you have got tested the above in past 8 weeks, you may upload the reports here for my review and diagnosis. If more than 8 weeks old, please go for repeat fresh tests.

I had been healing but I am concerned about my healing process. My uvula has gotten smaller and has strange color plus I see cobblestone at the back of throat and blue or dark red color surrounding soft palate. And there are visible blue or red blood vessels everywhere around the palate and arch.","Doctor":"Hi. All these are normal after tonsillectomy surgery. I will suggest some steps to relieve some of the symptoms you are facing. Gargles with Benzydamine mouth wash diluted in water few times daily will help soothe the area and relieve pain. You may also take Tylenol for a few days for the pain relief. To relieve inflammation (the engorged blood vessels and cobblestone formation) you can take a combination of Trypsin Chymotrypsin Bromelain Rutopside. This medicine will relieve inflammatory cells and products from the area. Cobblestone formation is normal after the surgery. Regarding the reduced length of the uvula and the scarring on the palate, I would say, they are due to bad surgical technique. We carefully dissect the tonsil out of the pillars so that there is nil scarring of pillars and change to the uvula. We use a coblator for the purpose that minimizes bleeding and postoperative pain."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor,I am just wondering what is abutting and abutment of the nerve root means in a back issue.

If it does not start by then, you will have to do urine pregnancy test to rule out pregnancy. Period could have been delayed due to stress. Another rare possibility is that of pregnancy. Though you mentioned the days you had sex as your infertile days, sometimes occasionally ovulation could be delayed making the days fertile. Still you had taken emergency pill (though it is highly effective in preventing pregnancy, protection offered is not absolute). So, there can be little chance of pregnancy which you need to rule out first. If you want to rule out pregnancy earlier, you can do blood beta-hCG test, negative result of which will rule out pregnancy. Other option as I told is to wait for a week. If pregnancy test comes negative and still period does not start, you can induce period by taking tablet Medroxyprogesterone acetate 10 mg twice daily for five days.

I have been diagnosed with subseptate uterus with the live fetus in the left horn. Baby is good, with heartbeat and growth. My doctor has advised me proper rest and some medicines. I want to know in detail about this subseptate uterus.","Doctor":"Hello. Let me start with a few basic facts and further clinical correlates and effects. Every lady has two uterine tubes, which fuse at birth, and over time, the wall between the two tubes disappear. Now the uterus is converted into a single cavity uterus. The upper ends of tubes remain separate as two fallopian tubes. Sometimes the fusion is complete, but the partition does not disappear. If the tubes do not touch others or do not fuse at all, then you get bicornuate uterus. But if only the wall is partially removed, it forms subseptate uterus. If the wall does not disappear at all, then the septate uterus is formed. Now in both the last two conditions, the main problem is that the space inside the uterus is compromised. The best option was to have a hysteroscopic resection of septa then get pregnant. Having rest makes no difference. At 14 to 16 the week, she can undergo an elective cervical cerclage. Due to septa, uterus loses its polarity, and she is prone to cervical insufficiency. As space inside the uterus is compromised, she can have preterm pains, preterm labor.

For the past four years, I have burning irritation in the middle portion of my penis after masturbation. The irritation gets relieved to some extent after I urinate. Please help me.","Doctor":"Hi. Penile pain occurs due to infections or inflammation of the bladder or prostate. Trauma, persistent erection (priapism), cancers, and Peyronie's disease (the development of scar tissue within the penis) are the other causes. Sickle cell anemia may cause priapism due to blockage of small blood vessels in the penis.

My question is does it affect his life expectancy?","Doctor":"Hello. Usually, in sickle cell anemia, blood transfusion is not needed. The prognosis depends on the severity of sickle cell. Dehydration, infection is a usual precipitant for sickle cell anemia. So it is better to avoid them and whenever having such incident, consult a doctor immediately. Sickle cell anemia patient's median age can be considered between 50 to 60 years but still, the exact specific prognosis cannot be predicted."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, Sickle cell anemia is my problem. My age is 30 years, while dehydration time, I am getting pain. Is this issue dangerous?","Doctor":"Hello. Yes, sickle cell anemia is a disease where RBC shape changes while dehydration and oxygen level goes down in body. Usually red blood cell will be round and plate shape. During dehydration and less oxygen time the shape of the red blood cell becomes sickle shape. Now RBC will stick together and block the blood vessels and produce ischemia. So to reduce the obstruction, you need fluids more. If obstruction is in lung, spleen, kidney or any organ, it is dangerous and severe painful. So avoid dehydration conditions, do not do severe exercise, avoid going to hill stations where oxygen is less. Drink adequate water."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor,I am suddenly feeling faint, weak, shaking, confused, and as if moving in slow motion. It has been going on for nearly 24 hours.

After a tooth is extracted, it is advisable to keep the gauze in the site for 30 minutes, in the same position. After 30 minutes, do not spit, take the gauze through your hand and discard.

Based on your age, it can be due to an impacted wisdom tooth. Sometimes, this can be due to any muscle problem too (myofascial pain dysfunction syndrome), mostly due to physical stress in that area or emotional or mental stress. As for now, do not open your mouth very wide, like during yawning, etc. This is curable. Do not worry much. Do you have pain along with the click? I would suggest you talk to your orthodontist or general dentist or oral and maxillofacial surgeon to get a final diagnosis after a clinical examination done by them.

I always eat candy non-stop and chips and soda, but I am so addicted that I failed the 30-day sugar free challenge in the first three hours itself. I need help, how can I stop this addiction if all my ways are failing everytime I keep trying.","Doctor":"Hello. Sugar is not an illicit drug, but the brain acts in a similar manner to other substance abuse and addictions. Another reason you could be craving sugar regularly is due to how it makes you feel after consuming it. Generally, a sugary treat causes a rush of both glucose and endorphins in your blood. One of the best things you can do to fight your sugar addiction is to start by swapping sweet foods for healthy alternatives like vegetables. Yes, vegetables can be sweet, but the natural sugars you find in carrots, beets, sweet potatoes, and peas are so much lower than what you will find in treats such as gummies, cookies, or donuts. At the same time, they’ will satisfy your craving for sweetness and you can train yourself to eat these healthier choices over-addictive sugary desserts.  The last small tip for fighting your sugar addiction is to generate a plan for how you will eat. You can write this plan out, post it somewhere, or simply keep a mental note of it, but a plan can help you to succeed in various situations. For example, keep carrot sticks cut up in your fridge so that after work, you can plan to snack on those instead of cookies. Or if you are going out to brunch, decide that your plan is to order an omelet with vegetables so that pancakes (basically, a maple syrup delivery device) is not an option. The idea here is to have a plan for how you will succeed in various scenarios that typically create problems for you."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, My daughter has a soft spot in the middle of her forehead for the past nine months but can only be noticed when she raises her eyebrows or if the lighting is right.

I was wondering if my results can be looked at by a doctor to give me anymore information on what is going on with my test results. I am only 25.","Doctor":"Hello. The reports are fairly normal including the hormonal profile but the progesterone levels (attachment removed to protect patient identity). If these levels are from the proliferative phase then they can be considered normal, however, if from the luteal phase, then they are definitely low. Considering that LH was 11, this test may have been done around day 10 to 14 of your cycle, was it? In cases of progesterone deficiency, one tends to get anovulatory cycles and also shortened cycles with mid cycle bleeds and irregular shedding with often passage of clots, so if not so and if you are experiencing delayed irregular cycles then cause is likely PCOS and not progesterone per se. Also, important in any fertility evaluation is the the male fertility factor. It is important to learn if the semen analysis report of your partner is normal or not, whether the quality and quantity of his sperms are good or not, so please share his semen analysis report as well for review."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor,Over the past six years or so, my intraocular pressure (both eyes) has risen to 16, to 19, and now to 21. Will it continue to increase still? Kindly help.","Doctor":"Hello. As you might have been informed, increased eye pressure is mainly associated with the disease called glaucoma. This chronic symptomless disease is very drastic to the optic nerve and might lead to irreversible damage, and in the end, cause blindness. However, this eye disease is never diagnosed or established based on eye pressure measurements and requires a detailed and comprehensive examination including many diagnostic tests like, visual fields, gonioscopy, OCT (optical coherence tomography), multiple measurements of eye pressure during at least three consecutive days and these tests might be repeated twice and even thrice in the first year and then every six months if the only suspicion remains. If you have not undergone these tests, please do, and if you require a second opinion, please upload the results of all these tests and I will gladly provide you with my opinion."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I think my right side bottom wisdom tooth is coming as there is a ball on the back side of my gum that is really swollen. It almost feels like a pimple and the area around it has white lines on the inner cheek wall. What should I do?","Doctor":"Hello. If there is not much pain, it is better to let it grow fully. It may take a month or two to fully come out. If it does not, and the area gets painful then better to get an X-ray done for its exact position. Use warm salt water gargle twice a day for a week or two. Use a chewing gum on that side, it helps in faster growth of the tooth into occlusion."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor,I am just wondering what is abutting and abutment of the nerve root means in a back issue.

What would be the drawbacks of laser treatment, is it very complicated?","Doctor":"Hello. This is quite a common question youngsters ask. The best answer to this is it depends on you and your daily activities, profession, and lifestyle, etc. For example, if you want to take up professional sports, modeling, enjoy adventure sports, few jobs in the armed forces, getting a surgery done would be quite necessary.  On the other hand, if you want to pursue higher studies and professions where you work a lot with computers and work on fine parts like watchmaking, then surgery would put you at a slight disadvantage as it slightly reduces image quality and increases chances of getting dry eye diseases. Some surgeons also prefer wearing glasses as it protects against infection and blood spurts during operations.  With the latest equipment and techniques, laser refractive surgery is quite safe, and outcomes are good. The risk involved is very less. Although a power of - 5.0 is on the higher side, we can still expect good results given that your corneas are suitable for the surgery.  The main thing to consider is of course long term outcomes are, 1. As a woman, your power will naturally change during pregnancy and lactation, and this happens to all women. Some have more, others less. This is unpredictable. 2. Surgery only corrects you for distance vision. Another natural change in eyes is presbyopia. Here you need to wear reading glasses. So even if you were to get surgery now, you would only remain glasses free for up to around 40 years of age after which you need reading glasses. I hope this answers your doubts. In case you have any further questions please let me know."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor,I had an oral sex with a girl without protection, and I licked her vagina too, later I came to know she has PSV which she had undergone treatment and she was cured, I came to know risks of the STD's via oral sex and I was suggested to have test after four weeks, but they did not tell what test I have to go through in detail.

Ask again if anything unanswered,"},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, My mother, is 76 years old, currently suffering from low, blurry vision (both near sight and far sight). Her BP, sugar, and thyroid are normal. A year before, she was critically suffered from urosepsis with AKI, DM II, pleural effusion, etc. but recovered. Though she has the first stage of renal failure and ventricular ectopic in ECG now. Recently she visited an eye hospital where she was told that her eye problem is mainly due to gradual damage of optical nerve, which is irreversible and the doctor cannot do much. In this respect, she was tested with digital fundus photography and OCT (Retina -Tessellated fundus in the right eye, FR dull in left eye). As per doctor's mention, I come to know that she has some cataract in the right eye (nuclear sclerosis grade II diagnosed in both eye) which need to operate soon for better vision, but I am not sure about it as it is not written in prescription as a diagnosis. She is advised to take a drop of Bimatoprost 0.01 % in both eyes every day to control optical damage. Now, I like to know is this medicine helpful if she complains with optical nerve damage without glaucoma or cataract. Is there any other solution to save her vision or further damage at least.","Doctor":"Hello. I understand your concerns, and I am very sorry to hear about your mother's eye changes. I am afraid that the changes in the optic nerve are indeed irreversible and according to the reports is near total. This is known by the part of the reports that say CDR 0.9 in both eyes. To explain it in a very simple manner, the eye is like a camera, both have lenses, and just like the camera has a film, the eye has the retina. If there is a problem in both the lens and the film, simply changing the lens would not improve the quality of the picture as the film (retina) is also compromised. But in few cases may improve to a limited, yet unknown extent. The problem also gets compounded with her poor general condition with heart problems along with the recent sepsis. So operating on her cataract is quite risky. Regarding the eye drops, Brimonidine eye drops have been known to help in neuroprotection and may help in the preservation of whatever optic nerve function is left, theoretically. So this would be the thought process behind this plan of management given to the overall condition. As far as the next step in managing, it depends on the daily activities of your mother and if at all she feels her current vision is not enough for her to carry out the daily routine activities. In case you need more information, please let me know."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor,My father is recently diagnosed with papillary renal cell carcinoma type 1, and he has no BP or sugar.

I would have liked to have few additional markers like his general condition, report of CBC (complete blood count) and LFT (liver function test), RFT (renal function test) to look at his risk score. In metastatic RCC, in first-line settings we have three TKI (Tyrosine kinase inhibitor) that are approved and commonly used. Namely, Sunitinib, Pazopanib, and Cabozantinib. Sunitinib and pazopanib have almost the same progression-free and survival benefit. Cabozantinib has benefit in progression, but final overall survival was the same as sunitinib. Toxicities are bit different for Pazopanib with more chances of hepatitis, weight loss, and diarrhea. If you are not affording for Sunitinib, then I would say Pazopanib would be better as it is cheaper with similar benefits and slightly different toxicities. Cabozantinib is costlier and not yet available. I hope it helps. I would be happy to help you further if you have any more queries or questions regarding toxicities of these drugs.

Braces are placed to align your teeth more esthetically and camouflage the malpositioned teeth. From your question what I have understood is either you have a large gap already, and for that, you do not have to worry, braces will close it, or you are saying that during treatment you are going to have a gap because of the teeth removal. In that case, I want you to know that a few teeth are removed during orthodontic braces treatment to get space for the rest of the teeth to move and align themselves, and ultimately the gap will be closed. So, in both cases, the gap will be minimized or closed. You do not have to worry. Maintain proper oral hygiene, be careful with the brackets, do not break them, follow the advice of the orthodontist and do not miss any follow-ups as these minor steps will help the treatment to finish on time or maybe a little earlier too. Now, if you can elaborate on your question, I can answer more precisely.

In the first few months of life, my son was faster than his sister in the growth and everything. And then, it was reversed. I am a graduate of psychology. I have a brother suffering from autism and frankly, I have a fear of this disease. I do not care and I do not want to surrender to delusions. But, mom and dad insist on reminding me of everything you see them that my son is also the possibility of getting hurt. I started since 10 months; I am watching my son very much. I blame him if he did not implement what I am asking. He says dad and mom. He loves to play, laugh and shake hands if I asked him to do so. He looks into my eyes when I talk, but I do not feel that he understands what I am saying to him always. For example, if I asked him to bring me cheesed off the table, he does not focus with me and ignore me. On the other hand, if he feels he is thirsty, then he will come to me and say a bottle of water. I know this is probably because the rate of a normal IQ and concentration varies from one to another child. I want a word from the doctor that makes me serenely scream in the face of all of the notes that my son is not normal and I tell them that my son safe and sound. The question is how completely I know that my son is not suffering from any problems in communicating diseases or behavior?","Doctor":"Hi. I have gone through the query with keen interest and understand your concerns. Before making any opinions I need to inform you that take the things in objective manner and not on emotions I understand there is history of autism in the family and it does not mean your child suffers with autism. In a normal growing child there are many ups and downs and not responding on some occasions is not indicative of serious pathology like autism. We need to take notice that a child plays well with another child, responds to language on most occasions, cheerful, not having any abnormal repetitive stereotyped movements and communicates with the mother. Having said this I feel it will be appropriate to fill a simple questionnaire called Autism Spectrum Screening Questionnaire (ASSQ). This is a screening instrument for autism and you will know probably with sure that whether there is problem or not. If you still feel there is something abnormal, then you may contact the specialist doctor nearby for a physical evaluation.

If still no cause for weakness found than EMG (electromyography) done. For gallstone, if no symptoms mean no abdominal pain present than surgery not needed.

We have never used any form of birth control yet our youngest is now almost 5. We have been actively trying for almost two years now. My periods during the last six months have been on time and consistent. I am 31. Why are we not able to get pregnant after two babies?","Doctor":"Hello. As I have learned that your last pregnancy was five years back and that your menses have been regular since last six months and you have been trying for last two years without any use of contraceptive practices to conceive. This qualifies for secondary infertility treatment. Now the first thing which needs to be checked is to get your partner's semen analysis done to check for quantity and quality of sperms as of now. There are chances that the count may have gone down or the quality may have depreciated which can be treated accordingly. In middle age men, such male infertility is common and needs to be addressed first before a lady is subjected to tests and examinations for evaluation of secondary infertility. Hence, it is requested that you may please get his semen analysis and culture test done first and review with reports. In the meantime, you may send across any ultrasound pelvis reports or hormonal profile tests (from the last six months) that you may have undertaken for review (if the element of PCOS still persists or not). Semen analysis and culture for the male partner. Male infertility. Secondary infertility. As per reports (awaited)."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I am 20 years old. I am a college student.

Around two months back, I had a hiccup when dead-lifting and my lower back or lumbar spine area had a sharp pain. At the time, I did not think much of it and since then discontinued dead-lifts. Over time, I have developed some sciatica in my left hamstring area. I visited a chiropractor about two weeks ago and he took X-rays of my spine, revealing that my lumbar spine is curved to the right, canting my hips and therefore putting pressure on my sciatic nerve. I went in for three adjustments with him, over a one and half week span. I no longer have access to my chiropractor, being that I am overseas. My question is what can I do by myself in order to straighten out my lumbar spine and un-cant my hips so that my sciatic nerve can get some relief? Am I going to have to find another chiropractor and get more adjustments while I am over here? Note that the discomfort of sciatica only happens with a straight left leg when bending at the waist.","Doctor":"Hi. Based on what you wrote, it sounds as though you may have scoliosis, a wedged vertebrae in the lumbar spine, a disc issue, or even lower cross syndrome. If there is any way to attach images of the X-rays, that would be ideal (though I know the current situation is not ideal). Assuming it is indeed a scoliosis curvature, I can tell you that you will not be able to straighten your spine (anatomically speaking). If it is a lower cross syndrome, your best bet while you are overseas is to work on core stabilization exercises. Bridge exercises, planks, and clams may all be beneficial to the lumbopelvic-hip-complex. All of these exercises can be found online, but essentially we want to strengthen the weak muscles and relax the overactive muscle. Please get the help of internet resources to have a knowledge of lower cross syndrome to get an idea of what muscles may be overactive and underactive. Without examining you myself, or seeing X-rays, this is about all of the information I can provide. When you return to your place, I would recommend continuing treatment with your chiropractor.

The fact that you are getting positive OPKs each cycle indicates that you have an anovulatory cycle or in simple terms that you are ovulating regularly. PCOD (polycystic ovarian syndrome) cannot be diagnosed alone with just small cysts in ovaries, rather one should have around 10 to 12 multiple small subcenterimetric follicles lining the periphery of the ovary during midcycle scan, one should have featyres of clinical hyperandrogenism like acne, hirsutism (excessive facial and body hair), acanthosis and most importantly oligomenorrhoea or irregular menses. Testosterone alone does not justify the diagnosis. However, if o e needs to be sure, then AMH (ante Mullerian hormone) test can be done, which is more than four indicates PCOD. As mentioned that you are on thyroid medications, I believe your TSH levels are less than five. Please share your ultrasound and hormonal profile reports for review. Now, it would also be essential to check for your partner's semen analysis for quality and quantity of sperms. I am not sure if you have any kids before or not as you have not mentioned, but if you do not yet, then semen analysis of your partner would be mandatory, as your reports are relatively normal.

Rather than relapsing and recurring course malignancies tend to have a progressive course. Further age is a crucial factor. Younger people usually do not have malignancies.

You are on high dose of Paroxetine and are also taking Milnacipran, Clonazepam and if even with these medicines the symptoms are persisting, then there is no harm in adding a low dose antipsychotic drug like Olanzapine. Olanzapine in low dose has great efficacy in depressive symptoms, anxiety disorders and in resistant depression symptoms. The drug is associated with excessive sedation and this is the reason you slept for very long duration after taking this drug. In that case one option is to reduce the dose of the drug to 2.5 mg and give this a try. This should help you without causing unnecessary sedation.

This can lead to continuous dryness and irritation in the eyes. Eyes also become hypersensitive. Systane ultra is artificial tear eye drops which is a substitute given for this dryness. But, the burning sensation in the corners can be due to an allergic reaction.  L-Pred may help that.

Presently, I am suffering from numbness and tingling in the mouth on lip area, prickling, burning sensations and numbness in feet, legs and palms, getting tired after moving through staircase, feeling some discomfort in chest area like heaviness for some time, gas problem and recurrent mouth ulcer. My sugar test, BP, NCV, ANA profile, TMT and ECG are normal. ACE 69, HSV1 positive, vitamin D 17 deficient and uric acid 8.2. I am completely blank now; I am not getting any hope of good treatment for my problem. I had unprotected sex 9 years ago. My CMIA test and rapid HIV test came back negative that time. I had medicine for herpes simplex for a month, vitamin D3 60K once in a week for four weeks and then once a month for six months. But, my problem remains the same. I will be highly obliged to you. I am struggling because of my present health condition. Kindly advise the treatment.","Doctor":"Hi. Your problem still could be due to a nerve problem, even though your NCV test is normal (nerve conduction velocity). Also, you might be having calcium deficiency, which is very common associated with vitamin D deficiency. I suggest you calcium supplements like tablet Shelcal HD daily once for three months. Apart from vitamin D and herpes medication, have you taken any medicines for your problem? Kindly let me know that. If not done, then kindly get serum vitamin B12 levels tested and revert back with the report.

Please clarify me the right step.","Doctor":"Hi. Really this is a confusing state, but this does not mean you have to abort the fetus right now. When mother get infected with chickenpox, fetus carries a risk. But the risk is only 2% and in those cases the fetus might develop rarely some form of abnormality. Thus, straightaway recommendation of termination is not always a choice. Definitely there is no direct answer and it is upto you what to do. If you want to have the risk of 2%, which is very minimal and often equal to an incidence of congenital anomalies in low risk pregnancy, definitely you can continue it. In that case, just go for an anomaly scan from a very good center at the 18th to 19th week to confirm about the integrity of the fetus.

PSA was 60 and last three years was on Urimax and past few months on Veltamplus. His PSA is 0.9 prostate size 45 cc and PVR is 70 ml. His symptoms have been the urinary frequency of every two hours all these four years. One doctor has asked to continue the medication. On a recent visit to the second doctor, the new doctor asked to stop the medication. So, I wanted a third opinion. What is the harm if we stop? What is the benefit of continuing it? The medication lowers blood pressure. So, it is down from the 70s to 50s.","Doctor":"Hello. I would suggest you continue medicines as at present his flow (which is good) and postvoid (which is less, it should be less only) are because of medicines. I think if he stops the medicines then his urinary symptoms may get worse or postvoid may also increase. There is no harm in taking medicines. Veltam plus (Tamsulosin and Dutasteride) may cause postural hypotension. If he is suffering from severe postural hypotension then he can stop Veltam plus.  So harms of stopping are: His urinary symptoms may worsen. His postvoid may increase. He may develop UTI (urinary tract infection). Regarding frequency which is every two hours, I think at 74 years it is fine. Just continue as it is. Because apart from prostate there are many age-related changes in the bladder which cause these symptoms and which are inevitable and irreversible. Until and unless very bad frequency like every half an hour then only intervene. Make some lifestyle changes like drink less water at night before bed. Avoid or reduce drinks which cause diuresis like coffee and tea.

Can I take Meprate or Deviry? In case I am pregnant, I want to keep the baby. Will these medicines cause abortion?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? You can definitely take either of the medicines, they both are the same. They are both Medroxyprogesterone acetate, and it is the same hormone which is released from your ovaries in the second half of periods after ovulation. In PCOD (polycystic ovary disease), as you are not ovulating, this hormone will be deficient. So, taking the pill meprate will cause bleeding, only if you are not pregnant. If there is pregnancy, this same progesterone hormone is produced by the ovary to support the fetus. So, these medicines will not cause abortion, but it will support it further. These medicines are very safe whether you are pregnant or not. It can never cause abortion. Hope I have clarified your doubt, do write back. All the best.

I thought I had a bug. Two weeks later, it seemed much better. However, my bowel movements did not return to normal. I had mostly constipation for about a month (even though my stomach did not feel as upset anymore). Then after that month, things flipped and now for the last four weeks at least, I have had movements that are almost diarrhea (very soft, formed only slightly). Colour does not seem abnormal and there is not a bad smell and I do not see oil drops in the toilet bowl. Every morning I have this. I also am having increasing stomach reactions. Every time I put food into my mouth, the gurgling starts. I am not feeling this is a food intolerance as it happens instantly no matter what I eat. I also get a lot of bloating due to the gas. I will, of course, be following up with my doctor, but wanted to ask here. I have a history of breast cancer, so I easily get concerned about cancers (I realize that breast cancer does not often spread to the bowels, but I am still worried about another cancer).

And they fingered me hard. Last night, I noticed a tiny bump on the inside of my vagina. It is a pea-sized right against the wall. It is completely painless, and I would not have even noticed it was there had I not put one of my fingers inside myself.Is it possible that this is just a cyst from the rough foreplay? It feels a bit smaller than it did last night, but I cannot tell. It almost feels like a pimple, But it is on the inside of my vagina, and I can only feel it by pressing my finger against it. What could this be?","Doctor":"Hello.  Yes, probably it is due to injury caused by fingering. And if it is not painful and not causing any discomfort, then you only have to wait until it resolves spontaneously. And the other option is that after a few days say three to four days you can get yourself examined by your local doctor to make sure that there is nothing more than that and this swelling has been resolved entirely.

Now from the last two months, I am unable to retract. The foreskin seems to have become tight and not allowing me to even pull it back a little. There is a kind of white patch formed at the tip of my penis as well. That is concerning. Could you please let me know what might be the issue?","Doctor":"Hello. Let me tell you one thing, you need not worry about your condition, as it is widespread to have phimosis, which is the case with you. The foreskin is tight in your case, and hence, retraction is painful. The white patch you are referring to is nothing but color due to fibrosis. This has nothing to do with masturbation. You can undergo a simple procedure called circumcision, which will get rid of the foreskin and your problem with it, once for all. It is a minor procedure. Please address the issue of hygiene better. Though there will not be any serious health issues with cleanliness, absence of hygiene can result in fungal infection, which can be avoided by addressing the hygiene properly.

But ultimately, it is the TSH that guides the dosage. Here is what you need to do, 1. Increase the dose of Thyroxine to 100 mcg once a day. 2. Take the tablet on an empty stomach. Do not consume anything except water for one hour after taking Thyroxine. (No tea, coffee, milk, iron or calcium tablets, etc.). 3.

Ideally, you should have done it under the supervision of a nearby Ayurveda physician. Because this procedure also requires a close watch and some dietary restriction. Even if you are taking some medicine without guidance, it is not advisable to do it on your own. It can also cause some issues like nausea, vomiting, etc. in some cases, and it might be hard for you to manage it at home. The amount of ghee should be taken on various factors, and it requires a complete history and clinical examination. Also, the amount of ghee needs to be increased day by day for some days. After intake of ghee symptoms need to be watched for proper digestion. If the physician does not find appropriate digestive symptoms, then he can manage accordingly. After proper digestion of ghee, a particular dietary regimen and lifestyle have to be managed. So you should do it under supervision.

There is a moderate pain with movement. He is currently having back pain issues before this head heaviness started. He has had a CT scan done and the report is as follows:  L1-L2 normal findings.

Your husband's lumbar spine CT (computed tomography)scan is indicative of a disk herniation, which is responsible for the pain in lower back and tingling sensations radiating in the right leg.

Please explain the risk statistics as in what percentage the patient have risks and what type of patients they typically are. The woman in question is an otherwise healthy 21 year old.","Doctor":"Hello. For someone who is 6 weeks or 42 days pregnant as per the ultrasound and the pregnancy has been localized intrauterine, there are actually two options: In medical abortion the patient is given a set of medicines namely Mifepristone and Misoprostol in a set protocol. The aim is to disallow further growth of pregnancy by stopping the cytotrophoblastic invasion into the endometrium (through Mifepristone) and then initiating uterine contractions and placental separation (through Misoprostol). The procedure for drug protocol lasts till max 2000 mcg of Misoprostol has been given in a set protocol till the pregnancy has been aborted. The success rates are 93%-96%, but the disadvantage is that it may lead to prolong bleeding for up to two weeks before all the products of conception can be actually aborted. Sometimes, the bleeding just continues for long and one may have to resort to surgical curettage to remove the remaining decidua in utero. Surgical evacuation is a day care procedure where a suction canal is introduced inside the uterus through the cervix, with patient under anesthesia or a paracervical block and the products of conception are suctioned out completely. If the procedure is ultrasound guided, then the success rates are 100 percent and major advantage is, one can leave for work after 6 hours (till the anesthesia effect passes of if general anesthesia or after 2 hours in case of post paracervical block). The remote chances of Asherman syndrome or intrauterine adhesions have been documented in 1% of women who underwent surgical evacuation where adhesions were formed inside the uterus leading to secondary infertility. But, a controlled, ultrasound guided dilation and curettage under an experienced hand is safe. I would suggest her to opt for medical abortion if the pregnancy is unplanned or accidental as this would be a natural way of aborting and moreover pregnancy being less than 7 weeks, can be easily aborted. A repeat ultrasound pelvis to check for completion of abortion shall be necessary after the procedure is undertaken. The mild bleeding and discharge may or may not continue for long, it depends from woman to woman. If this fails, then of course you have a surgical option to look at. Pregnancy should be completely avoided for the next four months of post procedure as that is the time required by uterus and pelvic organs to return back to their pre-pregnant state."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I am a 26 year old male.

But, just pain in your chest is not an indication of a heart attack. Since you gave a history of carbonated food and tablet Amoxicillin along with thyroid medication, these both can cause an acid reflux and that can cause heartburn and lead to such non-specific pain.

Can I take Disprin (I never take painkillers)? I use earphones on a daily basis under the prescribed volume limits. Though I have little pain sometime but not to this extent. Please suggest any medication.","Doctor":"Hi. My understanding and inference is that the pain is not related to the earphones or sound level.

Your symptoms are not very classical to diagnose. Please answer below questions for clear diagnosis. With the details available as of now, I infer that the pain is muscular most probably.

Sometimes, I feel this trembling even while sleeping and hence, the sleep gets disturbed. During daytime, I also get uneasiness and shivering for hours after an episode of heart trembling. My BP after this feeling was a little bit high at 180/85 mmHg and then it came down to 135/85 mmHg. I went to a neurologist and took CT scan and Doppler of the neck to find for any blocks. Both the scans were normal. The doctor prescribed Rancil, a beta blocker 50 mg, Aspirin, sleeping pill 0.25 mg and Vertin. I hear some sounds in ears. I also had ear pain and giddiness due to ear fluid. The doctor told that such trembling feeling may be due to ear fluid imbalance or may be due to little blocks in blood vessels, which may not be seen in the CT scan. After I took the medicine for six to seven days, there was no such feeling. For the last three days, I stopped medicine, which was prescribed for 15 days. Yesterday night, I felt the same trembling at heart and the sleep was disturbed. Then, I took only beta blocker 25 mg (half of the original prescription), Aspirin and sleep pill and I had a good sleep. I am not a diabetic and have no BP so far. The BP in the last three to four days was normal at 125/80 mmHg even though I did not take the medicines. I walk for one hour on a daily basis regularly.

Therapy takes some time and different medications work for different patients. IC (interstitial cystitis- painful bladder) is also a possible condition, but CPPS is more common in males than IC. You do not meet all criteria for IC as per the classic definitions. So, I would keep CPPS as the first differential. I am mentioning some tests that you may want to get done to clarify the situation in a better way. Recurrent infections. Urine anti-proliferative factor, EPS Culture (expressed prostatic secretions) after prostatic massage, uroflowmetry with post-void residual urine assessment and cystoscopy. 1. CPPS IIIA. 2.

Disease starting from this region without any other associated symptoms is quite rare and without them we may not think of a systemic pathology right away. Have you tried nerve tonics? I suggest back strengthening exercises and Pregabalin 75 mg once a day for two weeks. Vitamin B12 levels and HbA1c should be helpful. Consult a specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and take the medicine with consent. Lack of erections may suggest a more systemic disease, but we need to have more a detailed talk before we can attribute symptoms.

I am 26 years old male suffering from asthma for the past 14 to 15 years. So, I feel shame for myself when I use an inhaler. I am not able to go on tour especially in winter because I do not want to share my worst condition in front of my known people. I do not need any sympathy faces. Sometimes, I do not feel shortness of breath but wheezing irritates me, and I am unable to focus on work. When people leave me alone, then I take inhaler. When I take a bath in winter, I feel shortness of breath. Right now I am taking Bresol (Himalaya tablet) two times a day for past two months with lukewarm water. This winter I am drinking lukewarm water every time. But the problem is still there. When I go to sleep, I feel wheezing and the same when I wake up. A pharmacist said to use Septilin (syrup) with Bresol and take Bresol thrice a day and Septilin twice, and nobody told me how long I have to take this. I know asthma is not curable. Please give me some good advice and names of medicines (ayurvedic) for long time relief. And also advise regarding Bresol and Septilin (especially how long I have to take this).","Doctor":"Hello. Regarding the continuation of medicines, you may have to use the multivitamin tablet, Septilin (Tinospora) and Bresol (Turmeric, Vasaka, and Vaividang) for a long time till your allergic condition persists. These medicines are for helping your body develop good immunity against the respiratory problems. These medicines act slightly different than inhalers. Although, I would like to tell you that inhalers are scientific. Ayurvedic medicines may not help to get respite from an acute problem. Asthma is a manifestation of hypersensitivity. It is wise to find the cause of the hypersensitivity. We call the same allergy. Rhinitis asthma is different manifestations of allergy. Allergy is present in the genes, and we may not be able to cure allergy entirely. Allergen avoidance forms the mainstay of the treatment and management of allergy. You should be carefully noting down which areas and circumstances lead to the symptoms in you. Like going to gardens, smoking, pollution, dust, particular smells and fragrances, fumes, effluents, climate, etc. You should also note when the symptoms are more and when they are less. Whether there are any seasonal or diurnal variations. Once you have a detailed diary regarding this, you will be able to make some reasonable conclusions regarding when you have to be careful. Next method of finding out the allergen is allergy testing. The two methods available are skin prick testing and blood immunoCAP method. Both methods are easy and fast, but skin prick testing is more accurate. Once we find out the allergens causing the problem for you, we can give you specific advice on how to avoid these allergens and stay safe. The treatment of Septilin and Bresol that you are taking are to help your body stay healthy, improve immunity, provide all nutrients and micronutrient for the body to deal with offending agents. But these are not the definitive cure for the problem. Hence, it is not possible to say clearly till what time you will have to take the medicines. Additionally, if you get an asthma attack during the course of these medicines, you may still need inhalers or nebulization or medicines on an SOS basis. Do share with us your prescriptions and investigations reports so that we can help you better. Hope to see you healthy soon.

It is on the bridge of my nose. It gets better at times, but most of the time it is prominent. It also usually gets better when I am in a cool environment and worse when I am in a hot climate or in sunlight. I used to take allergy pills every day for about two years and then I noticed the rash, so I stopped pretty much completely for about a month. It seemed to get worse and again I started taking them for another 3 months probably. It had no effect on the rash and I stopped completely and I have not taken a pill for almost three months. Does this sound like a reaction to the pill or is it something else?

My height is 6 feet and weight is 260. I am overweight and also have low testosterone. I have had a noticeable shrinkage in my testicles in recent years. I have embarrassing erectile issues, including premature ejaculation and often I am unable to maintain an erection. I am not on any regular medication. I do not drink alcohol or smoke. I have attached my photos for your reference. My skin is discolored with red circles on my inner side of the legs up to each side of the scrotum. It frequently itches especially after much walking. The red circles are also present just above my penis, but are obscured by my pubic hair. I am also concerned about a patch of darker skin on my scrotum. There is also a pimple or a tag of skin on my inner right leg; two smaller ones on the inner left leg and one at the top of my right leg where my pubic hair stops. They all sometimes hurt, especially when my innerwear rub against them. I have had these for years. I was in the hope that they would go away on their own, but now I have noticed a few small ones begins to develop in the same area. There is also a mole or pimple like growth between the base of my scrotum and anus. This hurts or itches when I sit or walk too long. I have not sought treatment to care of these issues before because of embarrassment. What treatment or medication might help? What do you suggest?","Doctor":"Hello. At the onset I would like to tell you that though I understand your concern and situation, but there is nothing to be ashamed or apprehensive of yourself. It is a medical problem and can only be tackled by proper medical treatment and advice, and not by hiding your problem from doctors. It is great that you do not smoke as it may increase your problem. According to your weight and height your BMI is 35, which falls in borderline to moderately to severely obese. I advise you to visit or ask an endocrinologist regarding the shrinking of the testicles and erectile issues as these may be related to hormonal balance or even obesity. Red circles on the inner thighs (attachment removed to protect patient identity) are indicative of fungal infection known as tinea cruris. For this, a course of antifungals is advised. I would suggest the following treatment. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and take the medicine with consent. The outgrowths of skin are skin tags and they are usually related to hyperlipidemia. They are not harmful and only have cosmetic concerns. They are best dealt with by simple office based surgery with cautery machine requiring only local anesthesia, which is a 5 minute superficial procedure. But, they will not go on their own. You may get your fasting serum lipid profile done, which will measure the levels of cholesterol, LDL (low-density lipoprotein), VLDL (very low density lipoprotein) and HDL (high-density lipoprotein). If any of these are abnormal suitable, then medicine can be started. Medicine is important as abnormal lipid profile increases one's risk of cardiac events in the future. One important thing on which I cannot emphasize enough would be decreasing your weight. If you can gradually decrease your weight even by a few pounds, you would see a lot of these medical problems would get better by themselves. You may follow up after two to three weeks.

Apart from the odd barking dog and passing car, it is silent, especially at night. However, I started to hear what sounded like a distant engine, but it never got any closer. It is almost like a droning sound, not a hum as such as seemed to almost vibrating through me. It did not particularly stop me sleeping, but was annoying. It was there for a couple of nights and I would go outside and could not hear it. I could hear it in other rooms of the house, although maybe not as loud as the bedroom. I could find no real explanation for it. Electric cables are going to the house but have been the same for years, and nothing has changed. Then a couple of weeks later, the noise was back and was really loud when I went to bed. I fell asleep but woke in the middle of the night, and it kept me awake. The next day I could still hear it everywhere in the house, also in the next door house, but not so much outside. It is like a constant distant aircraft noise or car engine that goes in and out, louder, quieter, louder, quieter and at times I almost feel it than hear it. It left me tired with a slight headache, and it was just pulsating through my body all the time. That was the worst day. Since then we moved to another house in an entirely different area, although still a quiet village location. There is a very little passing traffic as we are at the end of a lane. At first the noise seemed to have gone; however, I have begun to notice it again. I can hear it all the time, but in the day there are other noises and distractions. It is at night when it is very quiet I can hear a constant drone. It now seems mainly in my left ear, or I can hear it especially in that ear. If I put my finger in that ear, it stops. Also if I hold my nose and blow and keep the pressure up the noise cannot be heard. If I put my finger in my right ear, I can still hear it, although maybe not as loudly. For example, it was very distant this morning. If I put my left ear on the pillow and lie on my side, I can hear it just the same. It does not keep me awake and or cause me any real problems. I am just getting concerned it could be due to something nasty, like a brain tumour or something. I went to the pharmacist and got some cleaning spray. I have also had a consultation with an ENT specialist. I did not explain to him about the droning sound as it is difficult in another language, but he gave me a checkup and did not find anything out of the ordinary by looking in my ears, nose, throat, etc. I have recently been diagnosed with hypothyroidism although I can get no connection. If it is tinnitus, then I can live with it quickly enough at the moment. But, I am concerned that it could be the symptom of any serious underlying problem. I have had recent blood tests done, and they were all fine apart from my TSH levels for hypothyroidism, and my blood pressure is fine.","Doctor":"Hi.

Glaucoma is a chronic disease that tends to progress regardless of all actions taken by the ophthalmologist slowly. Our main approach towards glaucoma is to keep it under control because we are not able to treat it and based on your history of ophthalmic care you seem to be in good hands, but you should be very punctual on your follow-up and doctor's recommendations.

I suspect that she must have undergone the retina laser and the injections for a condition called as diabetic retinopathy. I feel that most likely it is a complication of diabetic retinopathy that might have caused a high pressure in her eyes. Xen gel stent is currently FDA approved for refractory glaucoma not caused by diabetic neovascularization and Inn focus micro shunt is currently being tested for long term side effects and usefulness in such situations. I must be clear in letting you know that neovascular glaucoma is a very adamant disease to treat and the treatment may not be straightforward and may require multiple procedures and reviews with the treating doctor, yet the most often agreed upon surgery, across most hospitals in the world is currently Ahmed glaucoma valve, along with of course the laser and injections. In case you need further clarification or if your mother is not a diabetic, please send a scanned copy of all her doctors records and prescriptions. I will do my best in helping you understand the situation."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am suffering from asthma since last three years. I am using Formonide 200 two puffs two times daily. I am also suffering from GERD for the past seven years. Now I only take Pantacid 40 as and when required. It is my question. Is it a perfect prescription for me?","Doctor":"Hello. A Formamide inhaler is a good medicine for asthma. Is that dose right for you or not depends on your level of asthma control? If it is well controlled, it can be continued. However, if over the last three months of your symptoms were well controlled may be able to attend come down with the inhaler dose. I would suggest you be in touch with your pulmonologist for this.

Sometimes it happens in the daytime too. Wheezing is present, and there is chest tightness. I am taking Foracort 400 Rotacap during breathlessness. I am taking the tablet for the past four to five years.","Doctor":"Hi. Having night symptoms mean that your asthma is not well controlled and upgrading the treatment is required. Foracort Inhaler 400 mg is a right combination that is used daily. I recommend you take Singulair 4 mg tablet (Montelukast) once daily in the evening. Use blue inhaler during the time of exacerbation every five minutes till 20 minutes. If there is no improvement, you should visit the nearest ER (emergency).

As you said correctly that asthma patients should always take care of their diets as some food ingredients may cause a severe asthma attack. Grossly we cannot avoid all food types because there is person to person variability to the food allergy. So you should strictly avoid food that is causing some difficulty in breathing or attack. To find out exactly we can do skin prick allergy test or blood allergy test so that you definitely know what food you are allergic to. After that, you must avoid those food items. Processed foods, some bakery items containing eggs, chilled drinks, food colorants, should be strictly avoided. Always check ready-made foods or processed foods for ingredients. Sometimes butter, cheese, yogurt, and milk also needs to be avoided in some cases of diagnosed allergy. Otherwise, you can enjoy fresh fruits and vegetables in your diet."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor,I am just wondering what is abutting and abutment of the nerve root means in a back issue. Please explain.

As per your symptoms, you are suffering from bronchial asthma with allergic rhinitis, but you need to confirm this by doing a spirometry with reversibility test. Asthma is a disease related to hypersensitivity of our respiratory system to some allergens which cause triggering, inflammation in the respiratory mucosa. Undoubtedly you need to take medications else symptoms will get worse as your age advances. So visit a chest physician. I am a practicing chest specialist so I know the pros and cons of the disease. See this asthma is a genetic disease acquired during childhood, and any genetic disease means in genes and currently we in our medical field we are under research for a permanent cure like answers in this genetic diseases field, so my opinion would be visiting a pulmonologist or a chest physician for proper work up and guidance. Chest physician can do a spirometry and total serum IgE levels and as per your need will prescribe you some inhaled medications like long-acting beta 2 agonists and inhaled corticosteroids and maybe some oral steroids as per need which can help you with minimum side effects. Maybe you will need those medications for some duration like three months a year at maybe long or on changing seasons.

It is a cartilage protective drug and will help her improve some of the pain in osteoarthritis. For osteoarthritis: you have to remember that these medications like free flex, collagen peptides, SAM and MSM are like to help to nourish cartilage and provide some relief. They do not actually replenish the cartilage. I normally advise to take these cartilage supplements for a period of 3 months and gap of 6 months and again restart them. Just check the medication freeflex might contain MSM. Regarding osteopenia, I advise her to continue calcium and consult local orthopaedic surgeon if he can help her with some medications that can build up calcium.

I am fairly active on my feet all day because of work and I used to walk instead of transport. I was a lot more active when I was younger. I used to dance for roughly 20 hours a week and swim five hours a week. Since I have got older and due to injury, I dance for 2 hours a week and swim when I get a chance. I was diagnosed with Osgood-Schlatters in both knees when I was 16 and had physio for a year. They used to swell drastically and I still have prominent bony lumps just below both the kneecaps.

I read your concern. Sometimes, usually, they try to break the trigger points, and it would have caused discomfort. The technique itself is pro-inflammatory techniques and will induce some more inflammation so that healing happens.  So do not worry. Now, I request you to ice your calf frequently like once in two hours for 15 minutes as of now and stretch it properly things should settle down fast. Tomorrow morning you might feel a lot of stiffness in the calf, do not worry as you have to stretch your calf gently and roll your calf over a foam roller or if have somebody ask them to massage it for few seconds.

I had three generalised seizures, each of which lasted around a minute in the beginning of this year and none since. CT, MRI and EEG all came back clear. I have recently been diagnosed as B12 deficient and read that this can cause seizures and believe this may have been what caused mine. My aunt also had seizures all in the same day 20 years ago, all tests came back clear. They said it must have been viral. She refused to take medication when leaving hospital as they had told her it was viral, and never had a seizure since. She was then also diagnosed as B12 deficient. My neurologist still expects me to take epilepsy tablets. I am told that epilepsy is the working diagnosis. I never had any health problems in my life until I had these seizures. I took myself off the medication over two months ago due to side effects including that they were making me forgetful, not just forgetting to do something but my mind would be totally blank which really freaked me out as it is not like me at all.

Anyways, there are many other causes that may trigger seizures even in healthy persons like insomnia, alcohol or drugs, thyroid gland dysfunction, electrolytes imbalances, anemia, head trauma, etc. Epilepsy is a disease which leads to repeated seizures in the absence of the above triggering factors or other medical disorders. Coming to this point, as you have stopped medication and you are feeling great, I would recommend just wait and see if you will have any seizures while free of AED. If this happens, I would recommend starting another AED like Levetiracetam in low dose. In the meantime, I would recommend following a regular sleep hygiene, eating a balanced diet, avoiding caffeine, alcohol or smoking. I would also recommend avoiding driving in the next months as we can not predict if seizures will reoccur or not."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am 31 years old 5ft 11\\" in height and weight 24 stone.

I use hearing aids and I can hear from hearing aid, but it is hard to listen. One of the doctors said that I have bones issues, and I need to consult with a rheumatologist. But it is hard for me to understand.","Doctor":"Hello. The main problem with meningitis is that it is an infection which causes irreversible damage. As far as knowledge goes, there are not many cases who benefitted with the hearing. The cochlea is the hearing organ of the human body. It has three partitions filled with fluid. When hearing loss is caused by meningitis, the cochlea begins to ossify (the canals in cochlea start turning into bone). Thus the sound vibrations are not able to reach the auditory nerve. Usually, the loss is permanent. If you already wear hearing aids and now having a problem with understanding the speech, you need to see an audiologist and recheck your hearing as it might have progressed. If the loss has increased, please reprogram your hearing aids. If it has not changed, then you need to practice communication perception techniques. A speech therapist can help you with the techniques to improve communication. There are few techniques for better communication, but as you have not mentioned, I am not familiar with what method you use.

She has undergone CSF study and the report of the study is attached. She has been taking ATT medicines since then. The list of all the medicines she is taking is also attached. The medicines had come down to only one tablet (R-Cinex) in the last 10 months. But, now for the last two months, she started having back pain in the spine area and is now suspected to have a TB infection in the spine. She has a history of L3-L4 collapse four years ago, but that was due to osteoporosis. Her BMD score was -3.2. The spine has been severely infected from L1 to L5.  The MRI revealed an abscess with a pus collection in it (report attached). The doctor says it could be Pott's spine and may be because of a drug resistance (MDR), and they wanted to perform a USG aspiration for Xpert plus SRL, culture and sensitivity of pus. But, the test did not happen because the location of the pus was very deep in the muscle and could not be extracted. So, they extracted some tissues near by the infection area and sent for a small biopsy. The report of the histopathology (small biopsy) is also attached. It says mild nonspecific chronic inflammation. Since no strong evidence of drug resistance could be found in the small biopsy, the doctor has restarted the medicine of AKT-4 plus STM 0.75, and they want to see whether this reduces the problem or not.

Before we bring a pet in and before my kids become bonded, is it reasonable to assume negative tests will translate in no reactions. Occasionally, when I interact with animals, I have a reaction but it is difficult to determine whether it is actually the pollen which I am highly allergic to.","Doctor":"Hi. Skin prick allergy testing is one of the most accurate ways of diagnosing the allergen, one is sensitive to. It is definitely more accurate than blood immunoCAP testing (blood allergy testing). Skin prick testing checks your sensitivity to the protein in question. Even if sensitive, it need not mean you are allergic. Whereby, a positive result need not always mean you will get allergy with the protein. It means that your immune system is sensitised to that allergen and that an allergy can occur in subsequent exposures to the allergen. A negative in skin prick testing will mean that you are not sensitive to that protein and that you will not end with an allergy upon its exposure. This is true. But it is specific for the particular type of allergen. What all animal danders were included in your profile and what was the response to each? Is there a photograph or record of the wheal or flare that developed after each prick? Was the test read by a clinical allergist or immunologist and were you provided a report as to that you are not allergic to any animal dander? Were you diagnosed with pollen allergy or sensitivity? Have you observed any symptoms of allergy while in gardens or bushy areas? Or in any particular season? Does any one else in your family have allergies?"},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I am an 18-year-old girl.

She was scratchy all the time (at least every 3 to 4 hours). Even though we have applied moisturizers such as Aveeno, it was not helping her. When doctors prescribed topical steroids, we used it and she felt better. But as soon we stopped steroids she got the eczema back. As the doctors told we believed that as age progress eczema will subside. But she has even now and in fact it is little worse than before. We stopped steroids about six months back and trying to manage without it. One thing we noticed recently is that when we did not apply any oil or moisturizer (coconut oil or moisturizer never really helped) she did not scratch in the day time. But in the night between 12 AM and 2 AM she has been scratching all the time without sleep and sleep again. We are really worried if she will carry this lifelong and we are stressed. Also, we do not want to use steroid and would like your opinion on that if there is any complication if we avoid steroid completely and just leave her in this routine in the hope of getting better (we do not want her body to get used to steroid).After reading the above points please advise on how we should handle her without much medicine, if possible?Should we avoid moisturizer and oil as she is not scratching in daytime (rough patches still exist though)?When will she get better or at least have less and manageable eczema? Will it be at least at her teenage?","Doctor":"Hello. You have put your query with nice description but I think you have uploaded wrong images. So, if possible share correct images. From your description, it seems atopic eczema. It is endogenous eczema which may have several aggravating factors. Predisposition may come from the hereditary mechanism. Other first or second degree relatives may have features of some kind of allergy or atopy. Seasonal changes may also affect disease course. Some food like groundnut, cow milk, an egg may cause the problem. It starts with dry skin. Then some tiny lesions, sometimes oozing, scaling, crusting. They may coalesce to form large plaques. So we have to put first check on dry skin by use of plenty of moisturizers. It is best to use just after taking bath, tap the water with towel softly then apply moisturizer within 3 to 5 minutes of the bath. And have to apply 3 to 4 times a day as per requirement of skin to combat dryness. The dry or cracked skin may produce stinging sensation: burning sensation initially but it will go on its own. Or you can try a different moisturizer, even a good vaseline or coconut is also perfect. Topical steroids are useful during exacerbation of disease. It comes in different potency, and I hope your doctor had prescribed low-mid potency one. Like Hydrocortisone, Desonide, Flucinolone or Fluticasone. Among these, Desonide is best according to efficacy and safety. There is nothing like being habitual. You can stop anytime. But try to stop in tapering way like initially daily, then alternate day then weekends then stop. Your baby is 5 years old so you have one more option to replace steroids. Topical Tacrolimus 0.03 % ointment. Once lesions are clear by use of steroid then you can shift to Tacrolimus. Or on the face, it is alone sufficient. No need to use steroids on the face. How to manage with minimum medicine: Can moisturiser be avoided? No. Apply with a soft hand, do not massage vigorously. When will she get better? Usually, 80 % child become better by age of 12 to 13 years. But it depends on several factors like family history, exposure to aggravating factors, management of exacerbations. You have to pamper skin of your baby, care during cleaning, tapping, applying moisturizer all needed. There are several another way to treat exacerbation so you should not be worried.

Thanks for choosing this platform. 2 to 5 inch of the penis size is normal. The average size of penis is 3-5 inch while erect and 1-3 inch while flaccid. Having said this I like to inform you that penis size does not make things different during sex as only one third of the female vagina is sensitive. So, even 3 inch of penis in erect state provides equal pleasure to both partners. In regard to penis size your fear of small penis is baseless and you can get this idea out of your mind now. Girl may or may not think about the size as it is their domain, but as I said it dose not matter on bed. What you read in pornographic magazines is distorted presentation and does not hold any truth. I do not understand what do you mean by small testicle and low sperm count. It is the number of seminiferous tubules in the testis that matters. Other than that if you are having doubt you can get report of semen analysis which will reveal true sperm count in your semen.

They are white near the scalp and black in the tip. What to do?","Doctor":"Hello. As you are only 17 years old, the primary cause behind it might be genetic as your parents or grand parents may have white hairs at an early stage. The other possible causes might include poor nutrition, improper lifestyle, stress, etc. White hairs mean lack of melanin, the coloring pigment in hairs. Once the hair that grows white, there are fewer chances to revert them back to normal black color. But, you can stop further graying of hairs. First of all add foods like figs, curry leaves, raisins, fresh fruits, and vegetables in your diet. Avoid excessive caffeinated drinks, spicy and junk food. Quit smoking and drinking if you do. Sleep adequately at least for 6 to 8 hours a day. Try to go to bed before midnight. Avoid taking too much stress. As far as medicine is concerned, I suggest tablet Asthiposhak two tablets twice a day with water for six weeks. Apply Bhringraj oil on your hairs two to three times a week one night before washing hairs. Wash your hairs with a mild herbal shampoo. Have one glass of lukewarm milk and add a pinch of black pepper and turmeric in it and take it before sleeping. Try all these things, and you will soon feel positive results. 1. Genetics. 2.

I got scaling done 2 years back. Once I stop eating spicy food, the pain fades away in few minutes. I would like to know the reason behind it. Please advice me the preventive measures as well.","Doctor":"Hi. Hurting of gums while taking spicy food might be due to the following causes: 1. Gingivitis (swelling and inflammation of the gums) - Swollen gums may be painful and may cause burning sensation and pain while taking hot and spicy food. Gingivitis occurs due to either plaque or other debris accumulating around the teeth and gums. Also hormonal changes occurring during menstrual cycle can cause swollen and painful gums. Any medicines taken for medical issues like hypertension, epilepsy, etc., also cause gum changes and swelling. 2. Any ulcers in the mouth will get hurt while taking hot and spicy food. Ulcers might occur due to faulty tooth brushing techniques, usage of toothbrushes with hard bristles, stress, sharp tooth hurting the tissues, any dental appliances or ill-fitting dentures. 3. Any abscess related to infected tooth might also hurt while taking spicy food. But, you have mentioned that you do not have any cavities or teeth issues. Have you been examined by a dentist regarding this? 4. Any impacted tooth (teeth that remain unerupted due to inadequate space inside the mouth or remain inside the bone itself) may develop swelling of gums around it. When the opposing teeth impinges on this swollen tissue while taking spicy food it gets hurt. 5. Hypersensitivity reactions may occur to certain foods. This might cause swelling, reddening and burning sensation of the mouth. This may occur due to some food additives. 6. Habits like smoking and usage of tobacco products may also cause burning sensation while consuming spicy and hot food. 7. Dental procedures like scaling (cleaning of teeth) might cause minor tissue injuries. These hurt and cause burning sensation while taking hot and spicy food. But, this heals in 4-5 days after cleaning. In your case, this might not be the reason, as you have undergone scaling before 2-3 years. 1. Get dental scaling done, if you have any plaque or calculus deposits causing swollen gums. 2. Get your oral cavity examined by your dentist, for any ulcers, abscesses, infected teeth and impacted teeth. 3. Also get checked for any sharp teeth and any dental appliances or ill-fitting dentures. If found, sharp teeth have to be trimmed and reduced, and ill-fitting dentures and dental appliances have to be corrected immediately. 1. Kindly make a note if you develop any gum swelling, redness or bleeding gums during your periods. 2. Use toothbrushes with soft bristles for brushing your teeth. Also follow the proper brushing technique for brushing your teeth. 3. Make a note whenever your gum hurts and what foods hurt your gums. Check if any food causes the same issue repeatedly. In case, if that food contains some additive that causes hypersensitive reaction, then you may have to avoid that particular food in future. 4.Quit habits like smoking or usage of other tobacco products (in case you do).

However you can avoid sex in the unsafe period. The unsafe period is the period roughly between 10th to 20th day in a woman having a 30 days menstrual cycle. This period roughly corresponds to the most fertile period in a woman's menstrual cycle. You can also try the withdrawal method where you need to withdraw just before ejaculation, but it needs lots of mental strength on your part.

Nobody around me feels that smell and that is how I got to know that it is from my nose itself. Please advice.","Doctor":"Hello. Bad smell during breathing could be due to various reasons. Let us see those one by one. Malignancy: an intranasal (inside the nose) or intraoral (inside the mouth) malignancy can produce foul smell, that can be perceived as faeces smell by the nose. Malignancy can be painless and without any symptoms. Malignancies of paranasal air sinuses also produce foul odor. Dental infection: a tooth decay can produce bad smell. Dental infection usually produces significant pain. Food particles get collected inside the decayed tooth and hence cause the bad smell. Sinusitis: Chronic sinusitis can cause constant post nasal drip and purulent discharge (pus discharge). This results in foul odor. Maxillary sinusitis commonly produces foul odor. Sinusitis will have other symptoms like headache, facial pain, nasal blockage, post nasal drip, etc. Foreign body inside nose: A foreign body which has got stuck inside nose without being removed for many days will produce purulent discharge and smell. The discharge will be from one side of the nose. It is common among kids. Foreign body produces nasal block. Atrophic rhinitis: It is a disease where the normal space inside the nose gets increased due to destruction of the anatomy. Also the condition causes merciless anosmia (loss of sensation of smell). The sufferer cannot perceive any smell but the people around him can get the extreme foul odor emanating from the patients nose. Atrophic rhinitis also presents with crusting inside nose and nose block. Maggots in nose: Maggots are larval stage of fly (chrysomia). Maggots usually occur in association with atrophic rhinitis. Fly lays its eggs inside nose leading to maggots inside nose. They are attracted to the foul odor and they themselves aggravate the odor. Tonsillitis: Pus accumulated over the tonsil can cause bad smell. Tonsillar enlargement with infection and consequent foul breath is common in many children. Other symptoms of tonsillitis include fever, throat pain, enlarged lymph nodes of neck, difficulty and pain while swallowing. Nasal diphtheria can produce foul odor. Diphtheria produces a membrane over the affected mucosa. Rhinitis caseosa: it is a destructive disease producing foul odor. It was thought to be a fungal disease, exact etiology is still not clear. Tuberculosis: TB of nasal mucosa produces granulomatous inflammation and caseating necrosis, consequent death of tissues and foul smell. Hope I have cleared your query. Further evaluation and clinical examination is required.

When I pee, it stings a bit. The stinging sensation is subtle, but there is always a slight urge to pee. It feels like something is streaming down, but I can only feel it when it reaches close to the head of my penis. I am uncircumcised and I notice a white substance that seems to be, what I feel is, dripping down. I have not had sex in a while and if I did, it was always protected. I thought it might be due to lack of hydration. So, I have started to drink more water. I was told that cranberry juice works, which I started drinking today. My pee stream is slightly weaker, but the color is normal. Any advice? I thought it might be an infection but I do not want to jump to conclusions yet.","Doctor":"Hello.

People around me smell it all the time. I do not have my mouth open and people smell it soon as I walk in the room. What is it?","Doctor":"Hi. The first thing that comes to my mind is a disease called atrophic rhinitis. Here, the mucous membrane and structures inside the nose shrink and the nasal cavity is filled with crusts, which get infected and smell. In this condition, the patient has decreased sense of smell, but others can feel bad smell coming out from the patient's nose. A diagnostic nasal endoscopy is sufficient to diagnose the condition. It can specify whether it is atrophic rhinitis or something else. If it is at all atrophic rhinitis, the treatment is frequent saline nasal washes and mechanical removal of the crusts by an ENT specialist. Rarely surgery is needed.

Based on the description which you have given, there could be a possibility of Klinefelter syndrome. This condition can be seen in about one in 600 boys. A normal male will have a chromosomal pattern of XY. However, in case of Klinefelter syndrome, there would be an extra X chromosome which would have happened randomly during the formation of the egg or sperm, or after the baby boy had conceived.  The extra chromosome is not inherited. So, this condition does not run in families. The adult male body may not be able to produce enough testosterone, the hormone responsible for the development of male characteristics. There may be low energy and sex drive, lack of muscle and too much body fat around the waist. Most men with this condition lead normal lives and also have normal relationships. A few boys with condition may feel shy and may have low levels of self confidence. They may grow quickly than usual and may become taller than other family members. The testicles may be smaller than normal and may not produce enough of the sex hormone testosterone. This may lead to features such as: This condition can be diagnosed by: It is advisable to get treat early in order to avoid further fertility issues.

In your case, the Arjunarishta contains minimal alcohol. So, continuous consumption may cause some gastritis. If the symptoms appear within 2 hours of the consumption of Arjunarishta, then it might be due to the medicine. If the symptoms appear after 3 hours of consumption of Arjunarishta, then it means; it is due the disease itself. Only first 3 hours, the Arjunarishta will control the disease.

The test is not specific. You need to specify why it was done and what your symptoms are.

You may be a vegetarian because if you eat enough meat, you would not be having folate and B 12 deficiency.You may have vitamin B12 and folic acid tablets."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am a 25-year-old male. I am suffering from urticaria for a long time. I did not remember exactly how long but it has been approximately four months since I am suffering from this issue. My father and brother also had suffered from this, but only once or twice, but for me, this is a normal thing. My skin has become so much sensitive that even soft rubbing can cause redness, itching, and swelling. I had not taken any treatment yet because I was told that this would be cured automatically within a short span of time. But in my case, it is getting worse day by day.","Doctor":"Hello. You have new-onset urticaria. Since it has gone on for longer than six weeks, it is now considered chronic urticaria. It is a common condition. Most people will experience at least one episode of urticaria during their lifetimes. There are many causes of urticaria such as 1. Infections-viruses, bacteria, and parasites 2. Drug allergies. 3. Food allergies. 4. Insect bites or stings. 5. Physical causes like exposure to cold. The exact cause cannot be identified in about 50 % of the cases. Please try to see if you have changed any cosmetics (hair dye, creams, powders, soaps, shampoos, deodorants, etc.). Have you started any new medicine or supplements (including herbal, over-the-counter, etc.)? Any recent change in your occupation, use of latex, etc. Any urine infection-burning urine etc. Any use of food colors?If no answer can be obtained, I suggest checking a complete urine examination. Also, I would try a course of de-worming treatment. Albendazole chewable tablets (brand name Zentel) 400 mg. Take it in two doses. The first and second dose should be separated by a week. Take after food, only two doses are required. For symptom relief, try antihistamines. I suggest a non-sedating anti-histamine taken once a day in the morning.If this alone helps, fine, if not, take a different antihistamine at night. Take them daily for a few weeks and then start cutting back slowly and observe. If your itching and urticaria do not respond to anti-histamines, you may need to take corticosteroids."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor,I am just wondering what is abutting and abutment of the nerve root means in a back issue.

I have been diagnosed in the past with (SAD) separation anxiety disorder, autism spectrum as well as ADHD. Lately, I have been harming myself and having trouble controlling my emotions. I sometimes feel as if the whole world hates my guts. Then I feel good again a little while later, sometimes soon, sometimes not even until the next day. As well as some delusions towards those closest to me. Now that I have told you a little about my self. The question is, can separation anxiety develop into borderline personality? Can the fact that I have smoked weed almost daily for the past two to three years and occasionally from age 16 cause borderline. Or can substances like LSD, dmt, and ecstasy trigger the borderline as well? I am having a hard time believing how extreme my emotions are. Kindly advice.","Doctor":"Hello. Yes, separation anxiety disorder might develop in borderline personality disorder (BPD). But based upon the information you provided I am not sure if you have SAD. Smoking weed might increase anxiety, which could worsen the symptoms in BPD. Smoking weed can lead to precipitation of acute psychosis, which can prove dangerous. LSD (lysergic acid diethylamide) or any hallucinogen can increase psychotic symptoms."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I recently have had tests done after I was with someone that I do not trust after the fact. The only thing I have come up positive for is the common HSV 1. I remember having one outbreak when I was young and no outbreaks after. I have IgG antibodies present in my blood. I fear that the person I was with carried HSV 1 and reinfected me. I hope that my antibodies reacted and destroyed the second infection. I had a blister present on my skin after being with this friend. But it healed up immediately, more than a regular blister. Is there a chance that my IgG antibodies took care of the second infection? I told this person that I had perfect sexual health, and it was essential to me and the love of my life, which I am hoping to find. So it has hurt me at a phenomenal rate. I think of it daily. I need to know if I had IgG antibodies built up before reinfection, can it destroy the reinfection if symptoms are present? My symptom was present one day before it started healing. On the upside, a doctor that looked at it said it was nothing. Other doctors said it was probably nothing. It has cost thousands of dollars to find an answer. I am looking for a true love to live life out with and this is very important to me. Please let me know if IgG antibodies could kill reinfection if a symptom were only present for a day. It has been about nine months, and I have not had any symptoms. If you can help me, it would mean the universe to me.","Doctor":"Hello. I understand your concern. Please follow the following facts.  1. Once you get infected with HSV-1 (herpes simplex virus), as you had been in childhood, IgG antibodies remain there in the blood indefinitely or life long. 2. They help in containing further episodes, so subsequent episodes of herpes are always less in severity than the primary one. 3. Usually, herpes secondary episodes last for a few days, can heal in a couple of days also if it is minimal. 4. You are getting worried too much, and please relax, it has been nine months, there is no need to panic now. 5. You did not mention the site of blisters or any photographs you have taken, and it might not even be herpes. 6. There is no sign of HSV IgG in blood, and it just indicates you had an infection anywhere in the past."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am suffering from sinusitis and dust allergy. I cannot eat or drink cold items.","Doctor":"Hello. Have you done the X-ray of the sinusitis? Sinusitis is inflammation of the paranasal sinuses which are like air pockets found within the cheeks, frontal part of the skull and inside the anterior skull bases. Obstruction to the draining channels of those sinuses lead to blockage and accumulation of secretions which becomes infected and the problem begins. Or there can also be a congenital deficiency in the ciliary cells that beats to drain the secretions into the meatus. You will have to use antibiotics such as Augmentin, use Actifed tablet one tds. Also, you can use nasal drop to help open the ostium so that the mucus clogging it can go out. There is also a surgical procedure, e.g., antrostomy to drain out the maxillary antrum sinuses."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am 25 years old male. My problem is redness of the genitals.

Now I am applying no cream, only keeping ice pack, and I consulted another doctor. He said after seeing pictures that there is no fungus just irritant contact dermatitis. Please help.","Doctor":"Hello. According to the history given by you, it could be irritant contact dermatitis followed by application of dettol. Since you have used most of the creams and few of it containing steroids, your skin has got thinned, and that is why you could see red colored vessels. It is advisable that you should not apply any cream which contains steroids it could worsen your lesions. Apply coconut oil before taking a bath, no soap on the affected area during bath. Please share pictures of it so that we could start with the treatment. You might need to take oral steroids to improve your condition, but no topical cream. You can take tablet Levocetirizine 5 mg at night time for five days. This is to reduce the itching or burning part but not going to cure it.

I have much more arousal meaning my sex drive is back. But it is as though 90 % of the sensation is gone. While on Seroquel, I had more, but I stopped the medicine due to many bad side effects. It has been two weeks since my last dose.","Doctor":"Hello. Seroquel is Quetiapine, and the drug is an antipsychotic and mood stabilizer drug. In high doses in some individuals the drug is known to result in side effects like reduced libido, sometimes delayed ejaculation, difficulty in orgasm, etc. But Quetiapine is one of the safer antipsychotics if we compare this drug with other antipsychotic drugs.  The possible explanation of reduced sensation on the penis could be mild withdrawal, which might result in numbness like symptoms, and this may present with symptoms like reduced sensation around the penis. But the dose you were taking that is 50 mg is not a very high dose. Stopping this would not result in much withdrawal except mild insomnia. If we link this with sexual side effects of Quetiapine or Seroquel, then this will reverse by own in coming days. In most cases, sexual side effects go by own in less than four weeks of stopping the offending drug. You were not on a very high dose so that the recovery would be earlier. Prolactin levels increase seen with antipsychotic use (in high doses for a long duration, but some individuals even in low dosage). The standards will normalize in some days, and this will result in an improvement of sensation on the penis. No need to worry, and at this point nothing should be done because your erection is relatively better now, this means libido is improving."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I have a skin infection on my right arm and would like to know what I need to get better.","Doctor":"Hello.

Soltus (Amisulpride) is an antipsychotic medication given to manage symptoms like delusions, hallucinations, thought disturbances, etc. These symptoms can occur in different situations like extreme stress, psychosis, etc. Discuss with your prescribing psychiatrist regarding the diagnosis as he will have a complete history.

But, everything I try does not work. I have been having severe eczema since I was 8. I am about to be 19 now. I have tried using unscented lotions, dermatology approved lotions, organic oils and even all of the ointments doctors prescribe me with. The only thing that the lotions and ointments do is calm the irritation. Over the years, I have learnt to resist the urge to scratch unless it becomes unbearable. But, I always find myself sleep scratching. Yeah, I said it sleep scratching. I wake up with tingling legs and can see how hard I have scratched in the middle of the night. I moisturize all the time. Yet nothing works. I am getting to the point where it is starting to interfere with my life. I am young. I want to wear shorts and sundresses whenever I want. But I cannot because of the ugly scarring I have on my legs. I forgot to mention that my eczema is only active on my legs. Occasionally it occurs in my hands and rarely on my arms. Sometimes I even get it on my face. I have tried keeping my nails short so I do not have gross scratch scars but it does not work. I get my nails done because it does not leave scratch scars but it leaves bruises. And do not get me wrong the ointment is the best thing that works but I do not want to have to be wearing that ointment as a lotion. I have to leave to the ladies room about every hour so I can moisturize my legs to prevent the itching from happening but honestly who wants to live a life like that?

Being a dermatologist observes in day-to-day activity few diseases have bad impact on lifestyle, out of which eczema is one of them. But, with your descriptions it seems to be atopic dermatitis, which becomes better as age progress. In adults, it involves the flexural surface eventually localizing to the front of elbows and behind the knees. You need not have to worry that much. Besides medicine, you should do some yoga exercises, which will help you much. Few general measures you have to follow are: In case of oozing, avoid ointment or cream, corticosteroids in lotion form may be used. When there is no oozing or in dry eczemas, corticosteroid cream is to be applied locally twice a day. Local antibiotic cream with or without corticosteroid is helpful where bacterial infection is present. Skin biopsy needs to be done to confirm the diagnosis. Atopic dermatitis.

Can it be removed by microabrasion? Is the procedure worth? Please guide.","Doctor":"Hi. There are several reasons for the white spots on your teeth. Usually, white spots appear when the mineral content in the outer part of the teeth (enamel) is less. White spots could also occur due to high fluoride level in the drinking water or nutritional deficiency during teeth development and infections to name a few. Are the white spots only on the front teeth? Or do you have them on other teeth as well? Microabrasion certainly does not help whatever the cause of the white spots may be. It just makes the surface of the teeth rough and gives rise to other problems. You could consult your dentist and ask whether bleaching can be done. There are other options like placing a veneer on the surface of the teeth. However, a small part of the tooth surface needs to be abraded to place the veneer."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I recently got married and I knew my partner for long before marriage. My query is I am finding it hard to have intercourse. I am very active while doing foreplay, but when I am about to insert somehow I end up ejaculating outside. We as a couple are planning for pregnancy at the earliest. Please guide us. Thank you.","Doctor":"Hello. As per your history, you seem to be suffering from erectile dysfunction (difficulty in sustaining erection) after marriage. The commonest cause of erectile dysfunction after marriage is performance anxiety. If you are worried about erection and your performance during sexual intercourse, it could cause problems with erection. To overcome this, you can try the following techniques. You can take these tablets on alternate days if needed as the effect of these medicines will last for 2 days. If you are taking any other medicine for blood pressure or cardiac condition, ask your doctor if it is fine to take these medicines along with the other medicines. You will not need these medicines for more than 15 to 20 days because you will develop confidence when you have sex successfully for a few times. As you are recently married, do not worry about pregnancy so soon. You will have plenty of time and opportunity for planning a baby. This added pressure of getting pregnant could also adversely affect your erection. Performance anxiety. Erectile dysfunction. 1. Relaxation techniques. 2. Tablet Forzest and Rivotril."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I do not used to sleep a lot from early age. Daily to the maximum I will sleep for 6-7 hours. Now, these days I find scary researches about how sleep deprivation can damage brain permanently. I want to know whether my condition too is also related to sleep deprivation. Will it cause any permanent subtle changes to my brain? Please help me.","Doctor":"Hi. Yes, the research has gained a lot of attention and we do consider the facts. But, what has been done cannot be reversed. However, if we go with clinical experience, usually people who modify back there lifestyle do not get any ill effects in life. In fact, I would advice in such case that you should stop thinking that what is reversible and what is not. Start living your life normally and take help with a psychiatrist if there is great difficulty in sleeping. One can be treated easily with hypnotic drugs which help in controlling these issues."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, Recently my child seems to have developed phobia for terrorist. She is just 4 years old. I did not know how really she even came to know about the word terrorist. Now, she remains afraid for most of the day and night. She thinks that they are going to come to her. She does not like to go outside the flat and visit public area. I think it may be that one of the movies seen recently has left a deep impact on her. We tried our level best to convince her that movies show false things, but somehow the word terrorist has got deep inside her. She keeps talking about them throughout the day. We do not really know how to get this out of her. These things have started very recently and becoming more intense. Kindly help.","Doctor":"Hello. Child's mind is very delicate and easily moldable. Subtle things can cause drastic and unexpected effect on them, which we cannot even predict at times. In your case, it is quite easily observable to you. It is good that you could recognize this change in her behavior so early and decided to take an opinion for the same without wasting further time. Violence and rage have very severe effect on a child's mind. This is what happened with your daughter. The violence depicted in the movie and the reactions caused by that violence in the movie characters have made a deep impact on her mind. The fear caused by that violence had got imprinted on her mind. This can be the beginning of development of an underlying anxiety illness in her. So, it is very important for you as a parent to help her overcome this. You have to gradually make her aware that though the terrorist are the ones who spread violence and chaos, but on the other hand there are good people also who stop them. To begin with storytelling is a good way to inculcate things. Then play therapy can help. You can get her into play activities where you can strengthen her faith that there is no need to be afraid of bad guys and there are always good guys to help with. Gradually start taking her out and expose her to the people in neighborhood. Tell her about different kind of people living nearby. Familiarize her with the surroundings. Besides this, you should avoid watching content depicting violence and rage in front of your daughter. Child's age is a tender part of their life, they learn very quickly. So, use this as a therapy to manage her fear."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor,I am a 32-year-old woman. The one with whom I am in love sometimes behave rudely to me. He remains silent whenever he dislikes anything that I say. I am a bit outspoken, and I am unable to control this. His silence kills me. I find it difficult to do routine work. I feel so sad and shattered. He will not answer my messages and will not pick up my call even if I had called 50 times a day. I feel like hurting myself. I suffer from depression since childhood, and I am taking Amitriptyline since the last 13-14 years. How can I divert my mind and focus on my work during those times? It happens almost twice a month. We are together for five years now.","Doctor":"Hello. It looks like you and your partner have different personality styles and deal with conflicts differently. For example, if you are an extrovert, you would like to talk your way through issues. But if your partner is an introvert, he may have an aversion to conflict and arguments and may withdraw during stressful periods. This is a natural way of responding to some people and not to be taken personally.  If your partner is otherwise fine and treats you well, it may be helpful to have an open and honest discussion with him when both of you are calm. Write down your thoughts if direct talking can be difficult and ask your partner to reply. Both of you have to respect each other and learn to form your ways of dealing with conflict as a couple. It is natural for all couples to have disagreements, try not to overthink in such situations. Try relaxation techniques and carry on with your usual routines. If needed, you can try counseling or couples therapy. Also, look after your emotional health. Consult your doctor to review your mental health and the need for continuing anti-depressants. I hope this helps."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor,I am just wondering what is abutting and abutment of the nerve root means in a back issue. Please explain.

Grief causes significant emotional distress for some weeks, but usually, you will heal gradually with support from family and friends. To clarify, did you experience any emotional problems or mental health issues before your dad passed away? In that case, the grief can be more intense, prolonged, and you may need professional support like bereavement counseling.  Usually, pills are not recommended for normal grief. But if you have any other underlying emotional problems, kindly consult your doctor who can assess and prescribe according to the need. I will advise not to isolate yourself during this period. Try to go out regularly even if you do not feel like it. Open up and talk to trusted family and friends, tell them how you feel. Try to eat daily and sleep well.

If it can damage the pests, then that will be harmful to the baby. But we humans are bigger in size and damage is not significant, unless sprayed daily for many days, for a long time and directly onto the face. By 18 weeks, the baby is fully formed, so there cannot be any significant damage or long term effects on the baby. To be on a safer side better to avoid your exposure to pesticides.

When I was 15 years old, I started to suffer from depression and had to undergo psychiatric treatment. I was prescribed Trazonil for a sleep disorder and Flunil for depression and anxiety. I was under this medication for nearly seven years. In the meanwhile, I got hooked to alcohol and smoking before 20 years. I took an overdose and consumed almost 90 tablets of Trazonil in an attempt to end my life. However I survived, but I have felt that it really damaged my brain especially my memory and till today I remember most of the things which took place prior to this incident as well as things I learned, but in my daily life after that I became very forgetful and had trouble remembering things, events or new things which I try to learn. So my question is that is there any way which I can reverse this ill effect or lessen to a high degree so that I can remember things better or have a better memory. I have been drinking for the past 20 years, and since last three years after moving to another place my frequency and dosage of alcohol has increased, and I know it also plays a significant role in diminishing memory. I quit taking medicines almost 14 years back.","Doctor":"Hello. It is good to know that you are insightful about the problems caused by excessive alcohol intake. Have you contemplated cutting down on alcohol? Alcohol may be playing a significant part affecting your memory and also have a negative impact on your emotional health. Your memory difficulties may be more related to a history of depression and concurrent alcohol abuse. It is less likely to be a long term effect of Trazonil (Trazodone) overdose. You may know that alcohol has a depressant effect on the brain (despite the initial euphoric effect). With your history of depression, it is essential and can be tackled at the earliest. You appear to have experienced significant depression, including a risky overdose. You seem to be resilient in your way but are you still depressed? Are you using alcohol as a coping mechanism to manage everyday stressors? I will recommend consulting a doctor to review your mental state and proceed accordingly. You can consider counseling or talking therapy to address issues related to excessive alcohol use. Try reading books. Also make sure you take care of the basics like eat healthily, sleep enough, and exercise regularly. Try yoga or meditation if available locally."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, My girlfriend has been taking Microgynon 30 for two months, with two packages back to back. She took Microgynon for suppressing severe PMS. The medicine successfully suppressed the PMS, but there seem to be some side effects. She experienced some spotting for a week, and the other doctor told me that it is normal for a microgynon-taker. Her actual period started the very next day after stoppage of spotting (which is late for two weeks), and it has been lasting for 18 days. In the beginning, the volume is lower than average, but red blood is visible. In recent days, the volume keeps increasing, and it gets me worried about whether some issues are occurring. Should I take her to a gynecologist for a check-up or it is entirely reasonable for a microgynon-taker? We did not have any sexual intercourse before and in the case for an extremely rare accident, she took a pregnancy test, the result was negative. Therefore, pregnancy could be eliminated. She finished her second package of Microgynon around 6/4, and the next day, the blood volume started to increase. One more question, she has a third package of Microgynon and the gynecologist we saw said that she should begin the third package when the second period stops. Is this correct?","Doctor":"Hello. Your doctor is right in saying that this is normal with the medicine you are taking. Microgynon is progesterone. It is a hormone which builds up and helps in the growth of the inner layer or lining of the uterus called endometrium. Due to overgrowth sometimes the endometrium sheds off and appears as vaginal bleeding or periods. The drug is otherwise safe just that continuous bleeding is a nuisance and may lead to anemia. She must take some iron supplements and wear a panty liner. For PMS (premenstrual syndrome), she can try a few things after the course of medicine is finished. She must stop taking tea and coffee. Minimize her salt intake and less water for a week before her expected periods. Also, PMS is a broad term, and treatment depends on what symptoms bother her more."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor,My husband is mostly sad and depressed. He cannot listen a word against him or his family(mom, dad & sister). He gets mad and behaves very rudely with everyone if they do not agree to what he says.

He hides from colleagues and friends about his marital status, to some he says he is not married and to some, he says he is married, and his wife stays with his family and works in a bank (but I live with him and work in MNC). He always uses to tell a lie to me in small things also, he is never ready to accept his fault. Even if it is evident that it is his fault, he will never agree. He was flirting with some girl and went to meet her, and I got to know this when I checked his phone when I confronted him, he got mad at me. He is not ready to accept that he is at fault. He never answers my questions, always diverts the discussion. He does not have any plan. He hates my family for no reason and always say abusive things against them. He says he loves me but never let me live happily. In short, he is still right. Is he mentally ill?","Doctor":"Hello. I can understand your concern. Considering the history of the symptoms you have mentioned, there are few possibilities. One is some underlying mood disturbance which could part of bipolar disorder. This should be appropriately evaluated to make a diagnosis. Repetitive mood swings, keeping grudges, anger outbursts, repetitive lying, etc., are seen commonly.  Such symptoms can occur as part of some personality disturbance. Anger, irritation, etc., could be related to personality issues. Please talk to him and if possible, consult a psychiatrist.

These are usually benign and not life-threatening. These are frequently associated with MVP (mitral valve prolapse), caffeine, alcohol, thyroid problems may aggravate these. But, considering your age, we should rule out ischemia in you. You should also get a thyroid test done. So should get a stress test like stress thallium or TMT (treadmill test) done. You will need beta blockers like Metoprolol to keep these under control. If there is any evidence of ischemia, then you can opt for antiplatelets and Statin.

It will be safer to get yourself checked to rule out any systemic involvement, especially if you have any fever, pain, signs of the exfoliating rash.

I understand your concern but I think as so much time has already passed and by God's grace everything is fine then I think it has not gone into the airway, problem erupts only when it gets stuck in the airway, it might have gone down through the digestive tract and shall pass out normally through faeces. The biggest question is whether it went inside along with breath or food? That will surely subside the confusion and the one who swallowed most probably can feel this. I would surely want to know which number tooth it belonged to in order to know whether it was bigger or smaller in size. Anyway, an X-ray is always advisable for safety if your area is now open for the same.

It is the family and friends who take the patient for evaluation and not the patient he or herself visits the doctor for a diagnosis. Yes, depression or anxiety can be the possibilities, but these too should be evaluated. Symptoms of depression like low mood, anhedonia, reduced energy, fatigue, negative thoughts, bad thoughts, lack of surety about future, feelings of helplessness, worthlessness or hopelessness, etc. are seen.If he has doubts about his symptoms, he should be evaluated by a psychiatrist."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, Since I was around 8 years old, I have experienced mood fluctuations but not in the normal bipolar way (which I am being tested for). I do not feel like my mood sways between depression and mania. It is always some level of mania but without depression. I also experience tactile hallucinations such as something grabbing my leg, ants or bugs crawling up my legs as well as something breathing on and grabbing my arm. Tension headaches are also common, and intrusive thoughts pretty much ruin my life. Another common occurrence is I notice I have trouble talking, not in a word salad kind of way, but a slurred sometimes mumbled speech. My Psychiatrist says it is likely bipolar, but I do not think that that is the only possible diagnosis. To me, it seems more closely related to schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder. All I want to know is that is there a possibility that I am correct? Could it be a schizophrenic related disorder? In the past, they gave me Citalopram for anxiety.","Doctor":"Hello. Yes, your psychiatrist is correct. Bipolar is a more likely diagnosis. Bipolar disorder need not be present with depression and mania both. Recurrent mania also comes under the category of bipolar disorder. In mania, our sensitivity to stimulation increases like colors appear more bright, music appears more appealing and smoothing, also hallucinations are common in mania too. Schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder diagnosis are made only when there are criterias of disease which get full filled. You can refer ICD 10 bluebook for detailed criteria. To me also, the diagnosis of schizoaffective disorder and schizophrenia is less likely."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, My son aged 32 years is suffering from schizophrenia for the last six months and not accepting any treatment and since the last 10 days his symptoms got worsened and became violent and today he tried to get injured and he is suspicious on everybody thinking everyone is talking about him and plotting to harm him and asking us to kill him by giving poison and today he became very violent and after consulting a psychiatrist doctor today we gave him Risdone liquid 2 ml by mixing with fruit juice. Now he is sleeping calmly tonight. Please help us for further treatment.","Doctor":"Hello. I can understand your concern. A lot of patients of schizophrenia or other psychotic disorder refuse to take medicines and this becomes difficult in treatment. Risperidone liquid is tasteless and odorless and can be given without knowledge to the patient. But keep one thing in mind that he should not become suspicious that he is being given medicine by mixing with food. Most of the patients come to know about this. You will have to remain alert for this. This should be followed strictly. In coming days he will become ready to take medicines by own. Till then you can give him Risperidone liquid. He is on 2 mg per day and if needed, the dose can be increased to 3 mg per day. The second option in his case if he refuses to take even food or juices from you is long-acting injectables. Long-acting injections of Haloperidol or Fluphenazine or Risperidone or Paliperidone are available. These have actions for around 15 days and can be given to him if he refuses to take medicines. This can make treatment easy for him. You can discuss with his doctor for this treatment option."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I have had a bad cold sore 8 weeks ago on my top lip and a bit of the skin above it. I used Zovirax externally 2 weeks course and Acyclovir 2 weeks course to treat it. The actual sore improved, the blister stopped weeping, the scab formed and flaked off within 3 weeks but the redness is still lingering. I rung the doctors that put me through a pharmacist who told me to use Hydrocortisone 1 % cream. I used it for a week as he recommended but it still did not go away. That was two weeks ago. I also had a new flare up three days ago. Also on the top of my lip symmetrical on both sides. It looks different to a cold sore in that it was some redness and skin flaking. Home remedies I have tried so far: Aloe vera (not much help), Tea tree oil (irritated it), Manuka oil (helps healing where the sore is but seem to irritate the new flare up), Coconut oil (irritated it), Almond oil (seems to soothening it at the moment). I am worried if this is still unresolved herpes/cold sore and can be transmitted to my partner who does not have herpes. Is it contagious and am I able to kiss my partner?","Doctor":"Hello. As per the current picture sent by you, it does not look like a cold sore as of now (attachment removed to protect patient identity). Also, I would advise to stop all ongoing treatment (including the Hydrocortisone) and just leave it alone for a week. Apply Dologel only. It contains Cholinesalicylate along with certain other ingredients that help to heal. No application of any lipstick or any other ointments or creams to the region. I would not advise kissing for 2 more weeks atleast till things resolve to prevent spread. Also, limit alcohol intake if you are currently consuming alcohol. Avoid spicy foods too to promote healing."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am looking for an appointment with you firstly for reassurance I suppose and then CBT rather than waiting for the NHS. I have had OCD since I was a teen (intrusive thoughts and having to touch wood, say prayers, etc.). This seemed to subside until I had my daughter but then flared up again after and I was misdiagnosed with postnatal and placed on Citalopram. After a couple of years, I came off the tablets and was extremely stressed. Then suffered what I now see as an OCD relapse. I was petrified. I was losing my mind. Researched schizophrenia and almost gave myself all symptoms, suffered depersonalization on the commute home from work and spiraled into an anxious mess. I took myself to a doctor and was adamant I was psychotic. I was screened and told that I had bad anxiety and OCD. From here, I was put on Fluoxetine and things got a lot better. Five years later, I am going through a lot of stress and I stupidly did not take the tablets every day for a period of time. I am now again riddled with OCD thoughts and feelings around schizophrenia. I am my own worst enemy as I know if I had schizophrenia I would not query it. I would believe irrational things. So in turn, my OCD tried to confuse me and I do believe the thoughts. I do not want to carry on like this please help. I am a working mother.","Doctor":"Hi. I understand you must be going through a tough time. First of all, please do not stress yourself so much with whether it is OCD or schizophrenia or what not. You are much more than a diagnosis. It is important you are at peace and have some relief from the distress. Coming to your symptoms, you have said you have intrusive thoughts but what kind of intrusive thoughts do you have? And apart from saying prayers and touching wood is there anything else that you do? From your history, it does seem that you are having severe OCD which is causing a lot of anxiety. If Prozac has helped you in the past, you can reconsider the same medication but you will have to take it for longer duration like two years or more and at a higher dose like 60 mg. Consider tablet Clomipramine 20 mg along with Prozac for an augmentation effect. For acute anxiety, you can consider tablet Etizolam on SOS basis. As for psychotherapy, rather than CBT, exposure and response prevention seems to be a more helpful option for you but we can explore more on that only when we know the exact nature of your intrusive thoughts. Please look up progressive muscle relaxation techniques. These will help you gain some control over your anxiety symptoms."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I have a few and little genital warts in my vagina.

Her birth weight was 1.7, and now she is 2 months old and weights 3.1. Our doctor suggested dexolac special care. She is suffering from constipation, and gas problem after having it. The doctor suggested medicines, but there were no changes. One to two days she was fine, and the next day the same problem started again. She is mostly crying at night and not sleeping. Can I change formula powder? What powder is the best for my baby? Please advice.","Doctor":"Hello. Please note that children below the age of 6 months pass stools either once in two to three days or 10 to 15 times per day. It is normal, and it is not labeled as loose motions or constipation. If you are labeling it as constipation because of hard pellet like stools, then I would advise you to increase the water content of the top feeds and see. As far as the gas problem is concerned, it is also normal. Nothing is to be done. Almost all babies have gas just like a normal adult. There is no medicine for the same because it is normal. You can calm down a crying baby by either singing (light tones), suckling (allowing baby to suckle), swaddling (wrapping the baby in cloth), swinging (putting the baby in a small too and fro motion). You can also tap slowly on the stomach to reduce discomfort as and when required."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am suffering from depression. It has been four years. I am always demotivated.

Erectile dysfunction can occur because of many factors like diabetes, hypertension, thyroid disorder and also due to stress and psychological problems. So, visit a nearby psychiatrist to find the exact cause and then act accordingly. If there is no physical or medical condition then, Sildenafil or Tadalafil will help in erection and these drugs can only be used after discussing with your doctor.

I did not take the drug every day and after roughly two months I quit the drug altogether, the withdrawal, that I did not recognize at the time, kicked in (Extreme tinnitus, sweating, heart racing, heightened anxiety). I went to ENT doctor and she gave me two Dexamethasone injections in 3 days (I think 8 mg). I developed during these 3 days a major loss of short term and then long term memory, trouble finding words, trouble learning in general. The physical symptoms of the steroids and benzo withdrawal went away in 2 weeks. It has now been a month since I feel physically fine, but the cognitive issues persist and they do not get better at all. I have been to a psychiatrist because I felt overwhelmed that Iam not going to be able to finish school in such a state and she gave me Escitalopram thinking it could be psychological, but there is no improvement in cognition after a months use. Does that combination have that drastic side-effects and could it caused a chemical or structural problem in brain? What can I do to return somewhere close to my old self? I am 24 years old.","Doctor":"Hi. People taking Alprazolam should not combine it with alcohol and avoid combining it with other medications, such as narcotic pain relievers, that cause drowsiness. Doing so can cause additive drowsiness and reduced breathing as well as other side effects, which can be dangerous and possibly fatal. Alprazolam may be habit-forming when taken for long periods of time. If you have been taking this medication regularly for a long period of time (more than one month), do not stop taking the medication without speaking with your doctor. A gradual reduction in dose is recommended when stopping this medication to avoid withdrawal symptoms.  Escitalopram works by blocking the reuptake of serotonin so that there is an increased level in the brain. Serotonin is an important neurotransmitter responsible for mood and well being. It is usually taken once daily and may take a few weeks to months reach maximum therapeutic potential. So continue taking Escitalopram until you see significant improvements in your memory."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I hit my forehead against a wall and had a small cut on my forehead and now it has healed and it looks like a scar.

Whether your scar is permanent or not, it is very important to evaluate it. Mostly scar lightens and becomes equal to the surrounding skin with passage of time. However, scars which are deep becomes permanent. Such scar will not go away with any creams or gels. Best treatment for permanent scar is reversal by plastic surgery or it could recover to some extent with C02 laser."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am six weeks pregnant and there is a stone of 3 to 4 mm in gallbladder.

The symptoms like possessiveness, ideas, or even delusional beliefs about the fidelity of husband, blaming husband, etc. cannot be ignored. She might be suffering from some mood disorder most likely depression with psychotic symptoms. This could be some psychosis too. Individuals with psychosis show paranoid delusions, delusional beliefs, and become suspicious. Considering her age and late onset, the chances of depression with psychosis are more. She might refuse to visit a psychiatrist and will try to evade the visit. Drugs like Olanzapine or Quetiapine can be used to reduce her psychotic symptoms, and she will come out of depression."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I would like to ask about my symptoms.

Yes, if she has witnessed such life threatening trauma in her young age, she might act weird sometimes. But that does not mean that she has any psychiatric illness. You should focus on your relationship with her and give her proper time and she will come out of her psychological trauma. But symptoms like hearing things which others cannot hear, or talking to her mom, fear, etc., should be evaluated by a psychiatrist. This could be due to excessive stress or some psychotic issue.

I was recently admitted for a heart catheterization to check for any potential blockage after an abnormal ECG, chest and chin pain, months of breathlessness, and a very strong family history of cardiovascular disease. Fortunately, no blockages were found. However, my cardiologist informed me that I had diastolic heart failure. To be clear, he did not say diastolic dysfunction, and he said heart failure. My high blood pressure has always been controlled. My reports say,  1. Moderate tortuosity of epicardial vessels consistent with hypertension. 2. Hyperdynamic left ventricular ejection fraction of 75 to 80 %. 3. Moderate to severely elevated left ventricle end-diastolic pressure 24 mm Hg. My cardiologist never gave me a prognosis. He told me to eat a low sodium diet and to get checked for sleep apnea (which I will do), but he never gave me a prognosis. I have dealt with health problems for a very long time. It is essential for me to know what a diastolic heart failure diagnosis means for my lifespan. I am married and have five children, and it would be nice to know what I am looking at. Kindly advice.","Doctor":"Hello. I am sorry to hear that you did not receive any detailed explanation of your condition. Diastolic dysfunction is the inability of the heart to relax, which can be diagnosed with echocardiogram or with evidence of high pressures inside your heart chambers, as evidenced by the increase LVEDP (Left ventricular end-diastolic pressure) in your cardiac cath (it was 24 mmHg, and normal is considered less than 15 or 18 mmHg). The term diastolic heart failure is used when we have evidence of diastolic dysfunction as above in addition to symptoms of heart failure (the shortness of breath you described). There is some belief that diastolic heart failure is more benign than systolic heart failure, but in reality, that is not the case. They have similar prognosis when compared in general. However, patients with advanced systolic heart failure have a worse prognosis than those with diastolic heart failure. The complicating aspect is that there are no many proven therapies that work for diastolic heart failure, other than low sodium diet, diuretics, exercise, proper eating, and lifestyle modification. To provide a more precise diagnosis, it would be essential to understand how is your exercise tolerance, however that can be challenging with your multiple sclerosis. I hope this information helps. I do not want you to feel discouraged but instead focus on lifestyle modification. Eating well, stress reduction (mindfulness or mediation can help) and practice physical activity. Hypertension, and obesity. Possibly an exercise stress test to objectively assess your exercise capacity, sleep study, and probably a Holter or event monitor (to assess for arrhythmias or atrial fibrillation)."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor,I am just wondering what is abutting and abutment of the nerve root means in a back issue.

If you starve yourself for a long period of time, will it trigger you to want to eat more? This is a serious concern of mine, because I have never been such a big eater.","Doctor":"Hello. If you starve for a long time, your body demands for more carbohydrates to complete its metabolism. If the starvation continues for a long time, the body starts accumulating energy for the period of starvation, hence you feel to eat more. The best way is to provide lots of fluids and fibres so that you feel full and avoid carbohydrates and junk. Decide your meals to 5 to 6 meal pattern, increase protein fibre, you will maintain weight.

What you have heard about lack of Vitamin D as its cause is a myth among patients because nowadays there is a new class of topical drugs available which are analogues of Vitamin D.

I just thought it was a flu coming. But then, when I noticed that it had been on for two weeks, I decided to take Amoxicillin. I took it but did not finish the course on the last day. I had traveled and forgotten them at home. The sore throat went away but came back a few days later. I took another full course of Amoxicillin and during the course, the sore throat went away. I finished the full course but a few days later, the sore throat came back again. I went to the clinic and the nurse noticed that my throat was inflamed and prescribed Erythromycin. I took it but the sore throat kept on coming back. The nurse then prescribed Ciprofloxacin. I took the full course but still the sore throat did not go away. When I went back to the clinic, the nurse said it was no longer inflamed but I could feel it, but only that the discomfort seemed to be going deep down the throat. It is like each day I can feel it is moving down. It is not a very painful sore throat. I do not take any painkillers. My body temperature and blood pressure are normal and have been normal throughout the period. Right now, I can feel discomfort in my upper part of the chest. Another thing is that the first episode of sore throat occured after I visited my sister who from time to time gets swollen glands (below the ear). What could it be and how can I get well again?","Doctor":"Hello. I have gone through your complaints. Repeated attacks of a low-grade sore throat suggest that it could be chronic pharyngitis. The other common causes of chronic sore throat are due to acidity and gastroesophageal reflux. That means stomach acids pop into esophagus silently and burn the throat in the nights. You should undergo upper GI esophagoscopy and a throat swab to rule out infection. Try taking antacids for a week. Do not take antibiotics. I think this would suffice.

I have also recently started feeling mild pain behind my right testicle. Occasionally, my left testicles seem to change in size slightly and seem to almost disappear and the right testicle becomes quite tender and firm. I had an ultrasound scan about six years ago and there was found some cyst but little concern. About a week ago, I sensed a small lump rising above my right testicle to my lower abdomen, it was uncomfortable but I slept and the discomfort eventually went away. I see little blood-colored spots appearing on my arms and torso perhaps resembling perhaps petechiae and have an area of this rash on my torso that I am not sure may be related to my concern? I have been taking Azithromycin since yesterday incase it may be a virus or something bacterial but it does not seem to be helping the problem. I had a blood test in January 2020, but have not been able to make a follow-up blood test yet. Not sure why it might be necessary. What does the problem sound like to you?","Doctor":"Hello. Hematospermia (blood in semen), is fairly common. Generally it is not considered as a sinister sign. There are whole list of possibilities for this theoretically, but once we ensure it is not due to sinister cause and rule out treatable causes say like infections we do not beyond that as it will not affect the management. Sinister causes mainly prostate and testicular cancers. At your age prostate cancer is extremely unlikely but need to ensure no testicular problem. With your symptoms with testes, you need another scan to be on safe side as the scope for examination to be conclusive. I suspect you have epidydimal cysts which are very common and can cause pain, etc. So if the scan does not show anything other than this, I would not worry about it at all. I think the rash is completely unrelated to this or any of your urological problems. Nor the rash or hematospermia is related to old history of chlamydia. Since you have not had any other urinary symptom, I would not worry much about other tests related to urinary tract. However, I would also recommend sending semen for culture to see any infection in it. Lastly about prostate cancer virtually unheard in your age. Finger examination of prostate, PSA blood test and MRI scans of prostate are the screening tests in general. But not something I would recommend if testes scan comes back normal and if you are still worried an MRI then will be helpful as last resort. Idiopathic. Testicular pathology. Ultrasound scan of testes. Ideally an examination of genitals including prostate by a clinician. Semen culture. Idiopathic. Hematospermia.

In your case, if you are having oily skin, you should use Ahaglow S facewash four to five times a day. This will prevent oily skin which is one of the main causes of the acne. For the treatment of the eruptions, you should use Deriva CMS gel on the eruptions at night daily.

I understand that you have done strep test, which is a rapid test to find out whether the pharyngitis has bacterial origin. The strep test is positive and this means most probably the Streptococcus pyogenes detected in your throat is the causative organism for the pharyngitis. The strep throat infection has to be treated with appropriate antibiotics. I suggest you take a course of Amoxicillin and Clavulanic acid (625 mg) twice daily after food. Take supportive treatment in the form of salt water gargling of the throat, anti-inflammatory and pain killer tablets. Also avoid spicy, oily and masala-rich foods, which aggravate the throat irritation. As a painkiller, I suggest tablet Paracetamol 650 mg twice a day. Anti-inflammatory tablets are combinations of trypsin-chymotrypsin enzymes. If you do not get relieved with this antibiotic, then I suggest you go ahead with a throat swab culture and sensitivity.

Sgpt (serum glutamate-pyruvate transaminase) to exclude liver disease. 3. Urea, creatinine estimation to rule out kidney disease. 4. Serum TSH estimation to rule out hypothyroidism. Echocardiography to exclude cardiac cause and finally local ankle joint X-ray if needed. If edema leg more than diuretic like Furosemide can be prescribed after consultation with your doctor.

I did not experience any weakness in that arm or anywhere else in the body. The twitches lasted for about a week and then went away. The twitches have now appeared four weeks later in the same area (upper arm). Again, there is no apparent weakness, which I have tested by lifting weights at the gym and both my upper and lower body strength seems to be fine. What is worrying me to death is, could these twitches be an early sign of ALS? Is it possible that weakness will follow even though I do not have it now? Do ALS twitches go away for four weeks at a time and reappear? If I started to experience constant twitches six weeks ago, if this was ALS should not I have experienced some weakness by now? Is the fact that the twitches are localized to the same place a bad thing?","Doctor":"Hello. I have read your query and understand your concerns. First of all, I will suggest you consider other possibilities before jumping to conclusions. There are a number of conditions which can present with twitches without any disease, and ALS (amyotrophic lateral sclerosis) is one of the remotest possibility for a 38 year old young male. The commonest cause for twitches is simple worry or anxiety. I know at least 100 individuals with anxiety, who presented with simple twitches and no other symptoms. In my opinion, you need to see whether these twitches have any relationship with your anxiety level. The another common conditions which present with twitches is endocrine abnormalities, such as thyroid and parathyroid disorders. In case the stress level is not able to explain the twitches, an evaluation for endocrine abnormality is indicated. The list may go on in a similar fashion.

These are not pregnancy symptoms, but rather they are symptoms of ovulation with mild abdominal ache, nausea, headache, bloating and thin mucus discharge from vagina. As her last menstrual period (LMP) was in the last week, two months back. So, it is day16 today. Hence in a 30 day cycle, this is the time for ovulation. As you had sex in the first week the following month, still she can be considered in her fertile period and hence an emergency contraceptive is advisable to be taken in 72 hours in your case to prevent pregnancy. However, the earliest you can detect pregnancy would be after 7 days post-intercourse with a serum beta-hCG test. If it shows the level of hCG more than 5 ng/dL then shall confirm pregnancy.

First of all, I would like to tell you my point of view as an ophthalmologist in and against any contact lens that stays in the eye for more than 12 hours. The puffiness is most probably related to an allergic reaction that your eyes are experiencing, and you should discontinue using these contacts. The redness, the light sensitivity, and even the tearing are all signs of dry eye for which you should start using artificial tears at least four to six times daily, especially if you plan on using contact lenses again. Regardless of what any manufacturer says, you should not sleep with your contact lenses, and I would advise you to use daily from now on.

Now here, the family has to play an important role. Your child has started developing speech, and this is quite normal to happen. So, first of all, you stop worrying. And even if you worry because I know it can be alarming for parents, please do not pass on your anxiety to your kid. Just do not let her feel that it is abnormal. Whenever she speaks, to listen to her and never try to correct her or scold her for this. Pay attention to what she is saying and look at her, and eye contact should be there. When you talk to her, talk slowly so that she can grasp every word. Kids always try to imitate us. She will also start speaking slowly, which will help her say words correctly and with ease. Never criticize or scold, also tell everyone at your home and even school teachers. Encourage her to speak. Do not pass your anxiety to your kid is most important because if a child gets anxious, it will get more pronounced. Slowly and gradually, you will see that your kid has outgrown this. If still, you feel that there is no improvement after one to two months, speech therapy may be done. Speech therapy should be started before four to five years.

I suffer from OCD related tension headaches. On the 15th, I was in my father's office looking for something. It was too dark and so I decided to turn on my dad's lamp. It is an archaic thing, built in the 1930's by my grandfather's sister and it is mostly copper. I grasped for the light switch, instead I accidentally touched the copper beam of the lamp. The moment I touched it my hand gripped it. Around four to five seconds passed till I realized that my hand was shaking and got an electric shock. I quickly pulled away. Then, I felt sick, extremely anxious and in a daze. The next morning, I woke up extremely anxious and a tad bit confused. I felt as if I was confused. My parents brushed it off as anxiety and stress. Later that day, I had what seemed to be an allergic reaction to my lunch. I had red blotches all over my chest and neck. My face felt hot. Then, I received a 50 mg Benadryl shot. Almost instantly I felt as if the space around me shifted. I felt taller soon after I got tired, confused and disorientated. By the time I got into the car, I fell asleep, although I was not really asleep. I felt like I was slipping in and out of consciousness the entire way home. It was as if half of my brain had shut off. My muscles were limp and I was thinking strange things as if my mind was thinking by itself and I had no control on it. I then managed to walk into my room without falling and sleep. It was a dreamless sleep. When I woke up, I was irritated. Every voice in the house made me angry and I ended up cursing my brother and mom. I engaged in short nonsense conversations on and off. I would talk about something that did not make any sense and then I forget and ask what I was talking about. My head and neck vibrated. My muscles were weak and my body felt jittery. I wanted to sleep, but I could not. The space around me was fluctuating. Then, I had a large panic attack that lasted till 12 AM and I woke up the next morning around 10 AM with severe confusion and deorientation. I was thinking nonsense and could not construct a sentence. My muscles were weak again and I could not focus on reality and my head was vibrating. Fear sets in again. I do not cry even when terrible things happen as I usually cope, but I could not control my mind and cried a lot. We called the doctor who gave the injection. He told me that I was having some kind of allergic reaction and that I should take Zantac to help the Benadryl move through my system. Later in the day, it seemed to dissipate slightly. But, now (7 PM) it is back and almost as bad as it was this morning. I took another Zantac, but it has not done anything yet. I feel the vibrations most in my teeth and nose. Also, I have a rapid heartbeat. Is this being caused by the electric shock? And if so, will it go away over time? Am I in long term issue? Or is this caused by the Benadryl? It has been over 30 hours and I believe it is only since I was injected. Did this trigger long-term side effects? Do stress headaches have anything with this? Or is this caused by a combination of all three things? I just need help. Please I need to know what is going on. I really do not want to live with this. I am having a very hard time writing this.

I did not have any side effects like withdrawal bleeding, nausea, etc., after taking the I-pill. I got my periods on the 1st of this month. I am unsure if this is my normal period or bleeding due to the side effect of I-pill? Please help me to clarify this. If it is my regular periods, then there is no delay in it (a week before or week after than expected date). Is it normal? Is there a need to take a test or any chances of pregnancy? If yes, when to take the test?","Doctor":"Hello. Let me start by assuring you that you are not pregnant and need not worry. If you have had your periods 18 days before taking I-pill, your ovulation would have been around 13 to 15 days after that. Life of egg is only one day. So there is no chance of an egg being alive on that day of sex. I-pill or emergency contraception pill is a high dose of progesterone hormone. After ovulation, your ovary also will be producing the same hormone. As you have taken it after the ovulation date, the thickness of the inner uterine lining would have increased further. But would not have shed. Usually, if you take it before ovulation, your bleeding will start within a few days. So you should have had your regular periods, slightly thicker or more than usual. If you had bleeding almost like regular periods, then the inner lining of the uterus has been shed. There is no chance of pregnancy if at all, to catch inside the uterus. So do not worry, your next period will be one month from this period. I hope I have clarified your query, do write back if any more questions and for your feedback."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I have a milk tooth in the bottom row middle, which is moving and needs to be removed.

As far as small cysts are concerned they are unmatured eggs which failed to induce menstrual cycle previously, as a result, they got collected in the ovary and they will remain in the ovary. Now, you have got your periods you can start trying for conception. But I advise you to do it under the supervision of a nearby gynecologist because egg size is important while conception and that you can know by ovulation study.

I have sharp pain in lower left side that is coming every couple minutes but does not last long. Is this the start of labor? I am also possibly leaking amniotic fluid but I am not entirely sure since there is not a lot.","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing today? As you said most probably it is the beginning of labor pain. Usually cervix, the mouth of uterus is slightly to the left. Pain usually lasts for a few seconds only, but reappears. Do not worry. Minimal vaginal discharge with this pain indicates that cervix is gradually opening. To confirm about the pain, just feel the top of uterus, trying to indent your fingers. When no pain, you can feel the baby parts. When you get the pain, uterus contracts and becomes stony hard, you will not feel baby parts. Just having pain is not an emergency.  Just note four points:  1. Movement- you should have atleast four movements after each meal. 2. Pain- if it is frequent and lasts longer. 3. Leak- you will feel thick water just wetting your clothes. Not minimal discharge. 4. Bleeding- obvious red colour.  You will need medical help in all these situations. Do not panic, if this is your first pregnancy, it takes about 12 hours for baby to come out after true labor pain and 6 to 8 hours, if second.

I am going back to see him and question these results. Any suggestions?","Doctor":"Hello. Anisocytosis means a difference in the size of the red blood cells. This could mean that you have a mild iron deficiency. Anisocytosis of 1+ is a very mild variation in the size of the RBCs. Your hemoglobin levels are towards the lower end of the normal range and it is possible that your iron stores are depleted. This can be determined by testing serum ferritin levels. I would suggest that you continue taking the iron and folic acid tablets for another two to three months to bring up your hemoglobin levels and replenish your iron stores.

Viruses cause the vast majority of URTIs. These infections spread through the air (when you cough or sneeze) or through contact. They are not transmitted through food. Treatment for viral URTI is symptomatic. Fever medicines like Paracetamol, Ibuprofen, or Naproxen can be used. Nasal decongestants for the congested nose. If cough persists beyond a week, then a corticosteroid inhaler can help."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am a 20-year-old female.

Those are going to be four premorals, two on the upper jaw, and two on the bottom jaw. I heard that it is the only way because of my severe jaw defect. I was wondering if it can be true because nobody wants to get rid of healthy teeth.","Doctor":"Hello. I can tell you about treatment in the broader sense. In case of the shorter lower jaw, either a surgical and orthodontic treatment is done (in case of poor esthetics, both jaws and teeth are corrected) or orthodontic correction of only teeth. Since your question is about the second treatment plan and pertains to extractions I will answer that. Extractions are relatively common in orthodontic treatment to create space. In cases with smaller lower jaws with space requirement, upper arch extractions are mandatory. Lower arch extractions are also advised if there is space requirement or extractions needed for bite improvement or maintenance of normal bite. So it is reasonable to advise the extraction of four teeth. You can send pictures of your teeth and X-rays to confirm whether this fits your case."},{"Patient":"Hello !

My concern are low level of ferritin, high level of B12 and Urine WBC is very high.","Doctor":"Hi, Welcome to the icliniq Following is my opinion for your asked question. The low ferritn , Low Mcv could be suggestive of early iron deficiency anemia. The common cause for high B12 include supplement intake , Liver disease or Kidney disease. Your liver & kidney profile reports are normal.So don't worry about that. If you have any history of supplement intake than mention it.B12 excreted by urine , so might need not to worry about that.High Non Veg food also sometime can cause elevated B12. For low ferritin no need of any treatment.Repeat your serum ferritin & serum iron after few days. The WBC in urine could be due to urinary tract infection.For that investigate further with urine culture report.Meanwhile take more water & cranberry juice extract tablet.Attach the urine culture report once done.

After that, I feel very tired, a little out of breath, and a heavy weight on my shoulders. Should I be concerned?","Doctor":"Hello. You probably had a transient arrhythmia (abnormal heart rhythm). The most common type of abnormal heart rhythm at your age (assuming you do not have any pre-existing heart conditions) is supraventricular tachycardia. This can produce symptoms like palpitations, lightheadedness, and a strange feeling in the chest. An ECG, if done during the actual episode, can provide a diagnosis. But at least, you should get a baseline ECG. So, I suggest seeing your general physician within the next few days. Other things that are pertinent when you have fast heart rhythms are: 1. Excess production of thyroid hormone (a thyroid test TSH would be appropriate).2. Excessive consumption of caffeine.3. Any recreational drug use like cocaine.4. Electrolyte imbalance.If you get these episodes frequently, you should see a cardiologist who can order some tests."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, Do Zoloft cause muscle pain and cramps or tingling?","Doctor":"Hello. Yes, Zoloft (Sertraline) may cause muscle cramps, tingling by disturbing blood sodium chloride levels.

Proton pump inhibitors like Pantoprazole and Rabeprazole do not seem to have helped you. I suggest a dietary approach that will reduce your weight and also can get rid of the bloating, acid reflux and irritable bowel symptoms. That diet is the low carbohydrate, high fat diet (LCHF diet) or ketogenic diet. This involves cutting down your carbohydrate intake and increasing the intake of healthy fats. In my experience, nearly all people who followed this diet got rid of the acid reflux and bloating. The good thing is, you can also lose weight and possibly reverse your high blood pressure."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, A vein is blocked near the heart. The doctor told that he checked up today and there is a pain in the chest when he walks far. He is 45 years old, what should be done?","Doctor":"Hi. Blocked artery in the heart causes pain especially when one is engaged in activities like walking due to increased heart rate during activity which reduces blood supply to the heart muscles leading to ischemia and pain.

Beginning of acute upper respiratory tract infection, in case you show other signs including runny nose, cough, sore throat or others of cold and flu symptoms. 2. Frontal headache can be due to paranasal sinus inflammation which is part of cold and flu symptoms or part of long-term inflammation. 3. Stress, lack of sleep, anxiety or bad mood. 4. Bad sleeping position (for the neck) or uncomfortable pillow (usually comes in the morning and back of neck and head but can be in the front as well). 5. Anemia (commonly iron deficiency anemia, specially if you are having the monthly period these days). 6. PMS (pre-menstrual syndrome) few days before monthly period. 7.

First of all, birthmarks, moles are very common even with the localization that you mentioned. However, to advise you better, it is preferable to compare this lesion on photos taken during these last few years as a marker, keeping in mind that humans undergo many changes as they age. Second of all, it is more advisable to get digital images of this lesion captured by an optometrist or an ophthalmologist through a slit lamp and under magnification for better evaluation. Thirdly, if an ophthalmologist has confirmed your suspicion, a biopsy can be taken from it and sent to histopathology in the assessment at a cellular level, which will clear all doubts completely."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, My 16 years old son had a routine CBC performed as part of his physical for summer camp.

Are these because of air pressure and ambient noise?","Doctor":"Hello. Rather than a closed or open room, this is related to outside and inside ear pressure. There is an air cavity in our ear called a middle ear, and there is a membrane which separates this cavity from the external environment called a tympanic layer. So, there is air on either side of the tympanic membrane. So, when pressure on either side if high, then the membrane gets fixed and cannot move properly, giving the feeling of a clogged ear. And there is a connection between the middle ear cavity and our throat which equalizes pressure within the ear cavity and outside environment. So, whenever one gets an infection, then this tube blocked and there occurs a mismatch of pressure leading to clogged ear. And also swallowing movements opens this tube temporarily, which helps in equalizing the pressure leading to relief. Similar things occur when one travels in an airplane. So pressure changes are decisive in this. I hope this helps you and get back if you have any doubts."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I had a UTI two years ago that went untreated which resulted in the problem.

Multiplanar and multisequential MRI of the brain without intravenous contrast administration was taken. Single voxel MR spectroscopy through the basal ganglia was also performed. The brain parenchyma demonstrates interval development of diffuse cerebral volume loss, most prominently involving the cortex, with a widening of the sulci and ex-vacuo dilatation of the ventricular system. There is a faint T2-FLAIR hyperintense signal of the bilateral hemispheric white matter. There is sparing of the cerebellum and only mild interval thinning of the corpus callosum. Interval development of a subdural collection along the left cerebral convexity, most prominent at the left frontal convexity causing a mild mass effect on the left frontal parenchyma. It shows mildly increased FLAIR signal, likely related to proteinaceous content. The intraorbital optic nerves have decreased volume, compatible with optic atrophy. There are punctate foci of susceptibility artifact in the right parietal and right occipital region, likely related to minimal hemosiderin staining. No mass lesion or midline shift. There is no acute intracranial hemorrhage or acute territorial infarction. No hydrocephalus. No cerebellar tonsillar herniation. Preserved flow voids of the major intracranial vessels. There are bilateral mastoid and middle ear effusions and mucosal disease of the bilateral paranasal sinuses. Single voxel MRI spectroscopy at the basal ganglia demonstrates increased choline and mildly decreased NAA, nonspecific markers of parenchymal injury. Impression:  Interval development of severe supratentorial brain volume loss with thinning of the intraorbital optic nerves. Interval development of a subdural collection along the left cerebral convexity with mild mass effect on the left frontal lobe.","Doctor":"Hello. I read carefully and reviewed the patient MRI report (attachment removed to protect patient identity) and would explain that it shows a progressive brain atrophy (brain cell death) and small ischemic strokes, which could cause progressive dementia. These changes are probably related to small vessel disease of the brain (chronic changes in small brain vessels caused by uncontrolled diabetes, dyslipidemia, hypertension, smoking, etc.). There is also a subdural collection, which is causing mild compression on the left frontal lobe. I would recommend consulting with a neurosurgeon about this. I would also recommend to closely monitor his blood pressure values, periodically check his fasting glucose and blood lipid profile. If dementia is present (memory troubles, confusion), I would recommend treatment with Donepezil or Memantine. Hope to have been helpful.

Well, most of our patients initially complain to us about very vague symptoms at onset, just like yours. But we explore the possibility based on some more information and yes, of course, investigating them thoroughly. The pain you mention which made you still and shaky, can be arising from the gut as in abdominal colic (a sudden wave of spasm in muscles within the gut). Or can be arising from endometriosis which is anther problem of the female genital tract, whereby there is excessive growth of normal uterus tissues in the lower part of the belly. Thirdly, it can simply be due to perimenstrual syndrome which is pain occurring at the time of menses. For now, I suggest you to do some test and ultrasound abdomen and pelvis, later we can discuss the findings of your result. Functional abdominal colic. Perimenstrual syndrome. Endometriosis. Complete blood count. TSH (thyroid-stimulating hormone), FT3. Liver function tests. Stool detail report. Urine detail report. US (ultrasound) abdomen and pelvis.

Both of these medicines are SSRIs though, and I read about it online that everyone/every source says never to take them at the same time due to risk of serotonin syndrome. Today, after taking the Buspar, I felt cold and shivered constantly. I could not get warm and I was very sleepy. Now I am scared to take the night time dose of Buspar and Celexa. I would like to have a second opinion on the safety of taking these medications together. If it is not safe, can I take only one instead? Which one would you recommend, the Buspar or the Celexa? Thank you in advance.","Doctor":"Hi. You are not on too high a dose of celexa or buspar. However serotonin syndrome is not always dose dependant. I feel just the chills and sedation are too general to be indicative of serotonin syndrome. You should have some level of muscle rigidity, high fever, muscular contractions (myoclonus) to suggest that. In my professional opinion I do not have much faith in Buspar.  Celexa is good enough as an antidepressant (SSRI) to eventually help you have a full remission of depression, anxiety and panic attacks. If I was your treating psychiatrist, I would have supplemented the celexa with clonazepam (Klonopin) on a as needed basis, between 0.5 and 1mg every 8 hours PRN anxiety. If you are feeling cold and shivering constantly you might need to see your PCP (Primary Care Physician) to urgently address if you have an active urinary tract infection and also have him check your thyroid function.

I do not smoke or drink. There is no medical history. My penis is circumcised from childhood. The problem which I am facing is that I do not feel any sensation in my penis glans at the time of sex or while masturbating.In normal state, my penis is dry. I use lubricants while having sex. But still the penis remains numb. Only a few seconds before ejaculation I feel the sensation in my penis. I started masturbating 10 years back. Is this a reason for this numbness? I do not have any erectile dysfunction. But still I am not able to enjoy sex due to this problem. Is there any medication to enhance sensation? Please help me overcome this problem.","Doctor":"Hello. I read your query and understand your concerns. Having less or no sensation in penis while having sex is generally due to local factors. The systemic illnesses rarely affect in this way. Masturbation is normal and it does not have any adverse effects either on sensation or erection. So it is time to realize that the sensation problem is not due to chronic masturbation. The possible reason as per available history is dryness of penis which makes the nerve endings non-functional over a course of time. To counter this problem it is essential to use oil based soap (rather than traditional soap) and skin moisturizer which prevent the dryness of skin of glans penis. It can be said that you can use any branded moisturizer for application to penis and local area after taking bath every day. During love making session I advise you to use Durex real feel which is available across the globe for increasing sensation and making the sex more pleasurable. Unfortunately there are no medicines for this purpose and lubricants which I have mentioned above will be helpful to a large extent.

More and more stretch marks appear when they hurt and they hurt too. It is very uncomfortable, and it already affects my work (programmer) where I have to sit all the time. I have visited 4 dermatologists already, and one of them even said that stretch marks are not painful, maybe it is varicose veins. I already tried laser, derma roller, pain reliever, retin A, collagen cream and cocoa butter (but they did not work) as per doctors advise.

But few nerve endings become exposed to the exterior in the stretched skin. When weight loss occurs, stretched skin hangs back loose. But it is still not back to normal skin. It is still thin and exposing your sensitive nerves when you stretch, like when you sit or squat.

Please suggest.","Doctor":"Hello. I can understand your concern. According to your statement, you have been suffering from a tiny hard spot on the head of the penis. This type of tiny spot can result from various reasons such as mole produced from over secretion of melanin by skin cells. They are harmless and nothing to be worried. Penile papule appears around the penis head which does not itch or produce any fluid. They may disappear as time passes. Angiokeratoma is a tiny red bump that appears when blood vessels near your penile skin become dilated. They are rough in nature and may become thicker over time. Lymphocele has resulted from blockage in the lymph channel near your penile head. It does not need any treatment and dissolves over time. Peyronie's disease is resulted from scar tissue which is found on the top of the penis that tends to harden due to calcium deposition. Treatment is needed when it makes erection of the penis difficult. Again your penile tiny hard spot may be resulted from a pimple, cyst, or STD (sexually transmitted disease). As your penile spot does not create any difficulty in your regular performance so it is nothing to be worried and needs no treatment. I think it will disappear over time. You can undergo FNAC (fine needle aspiration cytology) or biopsy from a tiny hard spot on the top of your penile head."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor,I am just wondering what is abutting and abutment of the nerve root means in a back issue.

You have a given a complete account of the clinical situation and it is as good as doing a real time face to face consultation. It is not uncommon for women to have spotting early in pregnancy. Most often it is what we call implantation bleeding that is a process of baby getting attached to your uterus. The fact that there is no blood clot in the uterus and the fetal heart beat is present is reassuring. The diagnosis is called threatened miscarriage. In this situation there is a good probability for the pregnancy to go on well that is more than 90%, hence it is unlikely to be serious. You can continue with your normal activities as long as it is not physically demanding. It is also advisable to avoid sexual intercourse for a few weeks. Absolute bed rest is not needed and in fact may be harmful can lead to blood clots in legs. No need to follow diet restriction. Taking Duphaston (Dihydrogesterone) is alright, but again not absolutely necessary. Just be your normal self. Repeat scan in two weeks to ensure things are fine. You will continue to have some form of discharge pink or red or brown or black for a couple of weeks.

Well, the whole blood and serum (white fluid within blood) contains large amount of virus, and virus can live on blood spots outside the human body for the duration of one week. So actually it depends upon how much blood, and how much time it has been on the stain that can determine the chances of acquiring infection if contaminated with food. So I guess my answer can be partially answering your query. If you tell me the exact event I may be in a better position to tell you the figures. Otherwise, as a general rule, hepatitis B does not spread via food, having said that, it can still spread if blood contaminated food has been ingested. Since virus invades the human body when comes in close to mucosa (lining of our mouth) and then spread to blood within human. This happens in the same way as one infected person can transmit infection via kissing, hugging, sharing of a towel, spoon, plates, and so on. If you are puzzled with all that information, I want you to simply get a blood test for hepatitis B infection. It is a simple blood test that can give us a clue. I hope this helps.

There is a lymph node in the left supraclavicular region called as Virchow's node.

Sed rate and CRP in normal range, uric acid level tested after a bout of kidney stones last year, but that was also in normal range. Is there any tests you could suggest to my attending? Please advise.","Doctor":"Hello. The normal ESR and CRP essentially rules out inflammatory conditions. Uric acid levels, if high, can lead to joint pains, not body pains. Based on you height and weight, your body mass index is 37.3. This is considered morbid obesity. People with high BMIs can have issues like obstructive sleep apnea, impaired glucose tolerance and high blood pressure. Obstructive sleep apnea can present with manifestations like chronic fatigue and chronic body pains among others. If you are known to snore, have apneic spells (spells during sleep where your breathing stops for several seconds intermittently), feel fatigued and sleepy during the daytime, have frequent headaches and irritability, ask your doctor to screen you for obstructive sleep apnea. If present, that may explain your chronic body pains. Even if you do not have symptoms of OSA, losing weight can improve your overall health and prevent development of metabolic diseases like diabetes. If you want to lose weight, I suggest cutting down on carbohydrates and consuming healthy fats. This is a low carbohydrate, high and healthy fat diet (otherwise called ketogenic diet)."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I have protected sex with stranger and after that I get inflammation in urinary tract.

Please do not be worried. There are no chances of pregnancy at all. Firstly, because you had washed your hand with soap which carried the sperms and sperms do not survive on contact with detergent or soap. Secondly, you have taken an i-pill within 72 hours. Hence, your menses are likely to be delayed due to high progesterone pill you have taken. Now, you should get a withdrawal bleed within next 7-10 days from the day of pill intake. So, you should be patient and wait for the withdrawal. However, if you are anxious then as on today you may get a serum beta hCG test done to rule out any pregnancy conclusively. If the hCG levels are less than 5ng/dL then you are surely pregnancy safe and you can then calmly wait for your menses to arrive naturally."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, Recently, I had an operation in left external auditory canal under general anesthesia. I am having doubt that some GPRS tracking system has been inserted during operation. Is it possible to insert GPRS or something like that inside ear? Please help me.","Doctor":"Hello. Yes, it is technically possible to implant a small GPRS (general packet radio service) chip in your post aural region. But, that type of device cost a lot. I do not think that anyone can access to that type of device as shown in most of spy movies. So, do not worry. Nobody is going to track you.

When I was around 12 I started having high blood pressure and since then it has not stopped. I have gotten many tests done for my heart and all have turned out normal, but I am still concerned. I do have a poor diet and I am not very active. Could this be causing my heart problem or could it be something more worse?","Doctor":"Hi. You have done many tests with cardiac point of view? First of all, raised blood pressure in very young age, 12 years in your case, should be investigated. It must be secondary to some other disease. One of which is called pheochromocytoma. This condition causes both high BP and high pulse rate, along with sweating, fever. These symptoms are sudden and episodic. Pheochromocytoma is basically a tumor of adrenal glands. Other cause of high pulse rate may be hyperthyroidism in which thyroid gland is overfunctioning. Other symptoms include warm hands, sweaty hands, heat intolerance, weight loss despite good appetite, fine tremors, diarrhea, reduced sleep, thyroid gland may also be enlarged, some changes in eyes, etc. As you said your diet is not good, so it may have caused anemia. Anemia leads to fast heart rate. Another cause may be your sedentary lifestyle. As you said you are not active, it causes fast heart rate on slight activity. These are some non-cardiac causes of fast heart rate. Cardiac causes may be atrial fibrillation, inappropriate sinus tachycardia, atrial tachycardia, etc. Detection and differentiation of these requires ECG. If one of these is diagnosed, then next step is to detect the cause of it. Then treatment is done for the cause. So, possibilities of your condition are many. There is a huge list of differentials both cardiac and non-cardiac. Proper diagnosis requires focused investigations. Please provide your previous tests (ECG, holter, etc.) so that I may devise a plan for diagnosis of your condition which may require some other tests as well. Also send a record of daily BP and pulse rate of one week at least. Remember, if pheochromocytoma is the cause, then high BP and fast pulse may be present only during episodes and normal between episodes. Beta blocker is good to control heart rate. So please follow-up with your medical record and BP, pulse rate record."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am diagnosed with polycythemia (JAK 2 negative).

Your present CBC report is not suggestive of polycythemia especially polycythemia vera which is blood cancer condition (attachment removed to protect patient identity). Your JAK 2, EXON 12 study and bone marrow report is normal as per history. So polycythemia vera is very less likely. Your high hemoglobin could be due to secondary polycythemia cause.

It is advisable to repeat CBC again after a few days."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor,I have a patient who is an athlete, has a history of panic attacks.

I reviewed carefully your ECG images (attachment removed to protect patient identity) and would explain that besides right axis deviation, I also noticed the presence of prominent P waves in DII lead, which indicates a pattern or left the posterior fascicular block.

He was having trouble breathing, so we called an ambulance. I was very apprehensive about him receiving any drugs from a doctor. His pulse was 149, 161, and 150. The medic then said his pulse was falling, which I did not see. He then requested an order to give Epinephrine, which does not make sense to me. His pulse rate then fell quickly. What is your opinion?","Doctor":"Hello. An ECG should have been done immediately to see if the child was having VT, SVT, or anything else that would require you to slow down the heart. Based on the ECG, the next step could have been planned. This is because you have only written to me about the heart rate. The other aspects, like breathing and circulation (blood pressure), also decide the modality of treatment. Does it make sense to give epinephrine to a child having tachycardia? However, if there was no pulse afterward, epinephrine should be given at that particular time."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, Pain after idiopathic orbital inflammation before 11 years. I have undergone biopt two times due to inflammation with fibrosis and sclerosis. Now the doctors say the disease is gone. But I am still in pain and again using 15 mg Prednisone a day. They told me I have neuropathic pain, and this is more often in other patients with pseudotumor orbitae. My question is, can fibrotic tissue that is still visible on the MRI, cause the pain? Is there inflammation seen on the MRI? Or abnormalities or myositis?","Doctor":"Hello. I saw the MRI (attachment removed to protect patient identity), the sclerotic tissue from which we have to confirm that the pain you are experiencing is mainly neuropathic and emerging not from the sclerotic tissues as much as from the adjacent structures that are rich with nerves and blood vessels. Due to the anatomic changes that the eye has gone through, all the adjacent structures are still adapting to those newly acquired conditions, and that is what most probably is causing the pain. Whether it is from the compression or the disturbance in blood supply, currently, there is not much to do but to keep reducing the inflammation and prevent future reoccurrence with the prednisolone, but specific preventive measures such as undergoing a comprehensive eye exam as per the ophthalmologist recommendations are necessary. That examination should include tonometry - intraocular pressure, perimetry-visual fields, and optical coherence tomography to exclude any newly acquired changes that might require intervention. As for the diagnosis, although not much changes to the treatment will take place, it should be enforced with a blood test called ANA (antinuclear antibodies) profile to exclude any autoimmune disease that might develop on other organs. I would add a course of Neurobion, which is a complex of vitamins group B and might want to consult a physiotherapist on a method to improve blood circulation in the affected area. I hope I have cleared a few of your questions, and please feel free to follow up with additional inquiries or test results."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I got a little tiny pimple on my penis glans it vanishes when I use on ointment Lobate GM, and my glan skin seems to get a wrinkle, and it is not smooth anymore.

Is it delaying due to this medicine?","Doctor":"Hello. On the aspect of missing your period can be Sibelium (Flunarizine) because it has some effect of blocking the dopamine receptor in the brain. Besides, it is a calcium channel blocking effect. So the possibility is that by blocking the dopamine receptor that will cause a central increase of prolactin.

I recently saw a doctor. He diagnosed it as a curve in my lumbar and suggested I see a chiropractor here. Is there anything else I could do to fix this problem?","Doctor":"Hi. Yes, it is worth having a second opinion and clearing your doubts. But I think your doctor is absolutely right about the cause of pain. This is due to a slightly curved spine in the lower back causing the tailbone pain. Chiropractic adjustments and physiotherapy should help solve this problem. You should also try out anti-inflammatory medications to reduce the inflammation around your tailbone causing the pain while sitting. Medicines like Ibuprofen or Naproxen (for about 5 to 7 days). This medicine should only be taken if you are not allergic to it and if you are not suffering from bronchial asthma.

It started about a month ago when I noticed a vein on the top of my left foot that started bulging up out of nowhere. It was concerning but not painful until a few days later, it gave me extreme shooting, throbbing pain. This lasted for a about a week then started to fade to what it is today, a numb pain that gets sharp if I support my weight too much on that foot. This has limited my movement quite a bit, which makes it hard to complete my daily tasks, and I cannot wear closed toe shoes anymore without pain. The problem got even more concerning when other veins in my body started to bulge ang give pain, first in my legs, and now in my hands and arms. My left hand is my primary one and now I cannot lift things or write or hold it downwards without having a pain in my arm, where a big vein pops up just below the wrist. This has all happened in the course of a month. Does this condition sound familiar and if so, what should I do to get treatment for it?","Doctor":"Hello. Your problem looks like varicose vein. Veins will bulge when you are standing or moving around when unlike down it regressed and blood flows back into the deeper veins and empty back into the heart. Varicosity is due to incompetence or weakness in the valves within veins which prevents the blood from flowing back as the blood has to be returned to the heart for recirculation. Due to weaknesss in the calf muscle which contracts and compress the deeper veins causing blood to be squeezed out of then for upward emptying into the vena cava and into the heart. Blockage of the pathways of flow or deep veins due to venous thrombosis, usually common in women, tends to increase with age, and with use of contraceptive pills and with pregnancy because of increased intraabdominal pressure which in turn comprises the vena cava and affect return of blood back to the heart. Complications can be venous thrombosis due to increased stasis of blood. If there is so much build up of pressure for long time can cause venous ulcers. Management is elevation of the leg when lying down. Use compression stockings to support and collapse the veins, avoid use of high heels. Change your standing or sitting position from time to time. You can do Doppler ultrasound scan."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I have been using high quality, highly rated penis extender for two days for 8 hours a day and no for the past three weeks now.

The thyroid check you did was it thyroid function test to know the thyroid hormone profile, because a solitary thyroid nodule may be toxic and can be abnormally producing excessive hormones thyroxine which may cause other possible symptoms such as excessive sweating, weight loss, anxiety, intolerance to hot weather, diarrhea, palpitation (as if your heartbeat is audible to you).

At that time, it looked fine and till now, she had no pain or any sensitivity issues in eating. But off late, the color of the chipped tooth has turned green. We consulted two dentists, first one was a specialist in child dentistry and recommended an RCT treatment wherein a chemical will be placed to cure the infection. He said that the discoloration will increase with time and this baby tooth might fall off much earlier (in 4 to 5 years) than the expected time (6 to 8 years). The other dentist recommended to observe for six months and see if any rash or boil is developed above the gums and any kind of pain is experienced. He also said that such a tooth might fall off before time. We are confused as to what we should do?

As far age is concerned, your daughter still is in need of these teeth as permanent teeth take time to erupt, by 6 to 7 years they will erupt.

As tooth has changed color so it is better to act on the suggestions of pedodontist and go for pulpectomy or RCT. It will keep the tooth intact and prevent formation of any cyst later. There is nothing wrong with it and there are modern gadgets to do the procedure, she will not feel any kind of pain during the procedure. If you leave it as such, it will weaken with time and may later contribute to huge financial burden to treat irregular teeth."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am a 28-year-old female. I have been on Nucynta for over a year. I take Nucynta ER 50 mg BID and Nucynta IR 50 mg once a day. For the last two months, my urine tests (immunoassay and lab testing) have come back negative. Two weeks ago a blood test was done and it was also negative. I religiously take these medicines as prescribed by my pain management doctor. Due to these negatives he is now refusing to prescribe any oral medications (including my Flexeril, Gabapentin, and oral Ketamine). I understand his need to be able to prove to Nucynta in my system but he is also refusing to try anything else. I am a walking genetic defect. I also have known pharmacogenetic and pharmacokinetic issues. I also have EDS, CRPS, POTS, MCAS, gastroparesis (severe enough that EGD showed food in my stomach 18 hours after last eating), endometriosis. Could any of this be causing the problem? Could any of the medicines I take be causing the problem? My medicines are Lopressor, Trazadone, Fetzima, Zyrtec, Ketamine, Magnesium Citrate pills, Melatonin, Gabapentin, Flexeril, Nucynta, Junel Fe. What suggestions do you have? Is there any research to help me?","Doctor":"Hi.  Nucynta is an opioid analgesic, that has high first-pass metabolism when administered orally. It means only 32 % of orally administered dose reaches blood. After it produces its effect, 97 % gets metabolized in gastrointestine and liver and gets excreted out from body through urine.   In your case, you have delayed (slow) intestinal movements, hence the drug may get faster metabolism and faster excretion than a normal individual. Hence, I think it is not detectable in blood or urine.   Another possibility is very less amount of drug reaches your blood (less than 32 %) due to intestinal absorption issues. The half-life of this drug is four hours in healthy individual. It means, after oral administration, 32 % drug reaches the blood within 3 to 4 hours. If I draw the blood after four hours of oral administration, the amount showing in blood is expected to be 16 % (50 % of drug gets excreted by four hours). It is in a normal person. In your case, when to draw blood is the question. So, individualistic reasearch could be done for you with special care."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I was lying on my stomach for about 20 minutes.

As far as small cysts are concerned they are unmatured eggs which failed to induce menstrual cycle previously, as a result, they got collected in the ovary and they will remain in the ovary. Now, you have got your periods you can start trying for conception. But I advise you to do it under the supervision of a nearby gynecologist because egg size is important while conception and that you can know by ovulation study.

It may cause you a disproportionate and inappropriate fat deposition in the abdomen, face, on the upper back, and you would not like your shape. And besides the bad shape, you may start having high blood pressure, a heart condition, can predispose you to diabetes later. It can also lead to adrenal gland suppression by which the corticosteroid hormones will impair the natural hormone produced by your body, leading to adrenal failures.

I can understand your concern. According to your statement you have been suffering from pimples on your penis for the past few months. Pimples can develop on the penis as they are common elsewhere on the body. Pimples are resulted from blockage of the sebaceous gland of the skin due to excess sebum or debris or dead skin. Sebaceous glands excess secretion of oil (sebum) can develop pimples. For the prevention of pimples, you should avoid excess sweat-producing activities, wear loose clothes for preventing them from frictions, take bath regularly, and do not rub your affected area.

My testicle thorns with pain constantly and I have stabbing pain on hernia side. It feels like someone is sticking a bottle in me. I am struggling to walk very far, climb stairs and drive. I am unable to have a sex life. Is it normal to do both operations at the same time? Can you explain any possible cause for pain?","Doctor":"Hi. Well, ideally if you have bilateral inguinal hernia, or inguinaĺ hernia on one side and hydrocele on the other, the surgery should be done for one first before the other, not simultaneously so that when you are fully recovered of one, then the other can be planned and done. Pain can be due to entrapment of a nerve like ileoinguinal or ileohypogastric nerves which run with the spermatic cords or it could be also present if there is improper repair with subsequent breakdown of the repair and subsequent herniation of the bowel content into the inguinal ring or it can be from infection of the operation site. 12 weeks is quite a long time for surgical pains to have disappeared. You will need to do an abdominal pelvic ultrasound scan to see if there is any reccurence or failure of the surgery or if there is entrapment of visceral content."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I have lost my prescription for Lipitor and have been taking it for four days.

The half life of Lipitor (Atorvastatin) is 14 hours in humans (meaning drug is eliminated in about 14 hours). The main effect of Lipitor is to block the buildup and making of cholesterol in body. It does the job together with the help of other active ingredients and its effect on cholesterol synthesis is maintained in the body for about 20 to 30 hours. In this situation, it does not seem an issue if you just missed a dose or so. Do not worry about it.

I presume that this recurrent anal yeast infection is candidiasis, and you have been using a topical mixture of antifungal and corticosteroid cream over it. Have you checked for immune statuses like HIV, and blood sugar level to rule out diabetes? Then if you have been using a steroid medicine for a very long time, that can also depress your immunity. If all these tests have been done and are negative, and you are not on prolonged use of the steroid, then I will prescribe an enteral antifungal together with the topical cream.

Racing thoughts, heaviness in the head, pain in neck and shoulder, excessive stress along with sleeplessness, etc., could be because of anxiety. If you have impairment in functioning, then please visit a psychiatrist for evaluation. Drugs like SSRIs (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor) can help you in coming out of stress.

ADHD (attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder) is a developmental condition which is noticeable since early childhood. Symptoms like hyperactivity, impulsivity, inattention will be present before the age of 12 years. Parents and teacher would have commented about it even in nursery and early primary school years. It is unlikely for someone to develop to ADHD in teenage years without having any symptoms before. Other causes like anxiety, too much stress and pressure, family, and social problems need to be ruled out.

The McKenzie maneuver is simple, and you can read about it and practice it.

Do proper exercise which will regain the strength in the muscles and avoid nerve root entrapment. In most cases, the pain is caused due to more of the muscle weakness, and it is common in most cases to have received the symptoms back.

I recommend that you use ice packs to help faster recovery. The vision will likely improve in case you have any watering. This will happen spontaneously. I recommend that you see an ophthalmologist in case of no improvement in symptoms in a day or two. Redness, swelling, and pain can also occur due to a fracture of the orbital and facial bones. These will need repair to heal. Blurred vision can be due to various causes after injury. The most important and dangerous of these is retinal detachment and cataracts. I hope this helps you."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I have dryness, redness and red lines in both eyes. No liquid discharge. Right eye hurts sometime. I have 5 to 6 hours work on laptops.","Doctor":"Hi. People spending longer time on computer, laptop screens have greater chances of developing dry eyes. Because while using computer, blink rate is decreased to 1 to 2 time per minute. Normal blinking is necessary to keep eye surface wet and eyelids function as wipers and spread tear film on corneal surface. If you do not blink, eye surface gets dry and you will feel irritation of grittiness or mild redness. Longer time you spend on screen, more chances of developing dry eyes.  So you need to slightly modify blinking habbits while working on laptop, screen. You should blink every 15 to 20 seconds to keep eyes wet. Secondly, you can use artifical tears, lubricants to minimize dryness. You can use Systane eye drop or Tears Naturale eye drop or any other tears available to you. You can use 3 to 4 times but you can also use more frequently if you feel so. There is no side effect of these drops, these are only artificial tears. I hope your problem will be solved."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I have been told that I have a kapha vata imbalance and I have taken vasthi (Panchakarma) procedure. But I still have white coating on tongue and my digestion is weak and. And if I do not eat, I feel weak and nervous. If I eat, I get indigestion. Will Agathiyar Kuzhambu help me?","Doctor":"Hi. Vasthi reduces vatha imbalance. But, this is not the final treatment. After the purification (detoxifying) therapy, further, follow up with herbal drugs needs to be taken based on your current clinical feature and naadi.  Agasthiyar Kuzambu is given once in four months for a normal individual to detoxify body. For any specific disease conditions, it is given more frequently with suitable Anupanam. It can be given to you after careful examination. Can you consult nearby Siddha doctor? After Agasthiyar Kuzhambu, further herbal medicines need to be continued for 2 to 3 months for better benefit. We need to see directly whether it is a fungal infection.  In your case, I feel, you may take Nannaari Manappaagu (syrup) one spoon mixed with water (morning, afternoon, evening) before each meal. This will remove your tongue coating."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I have 3.5 months old baby. I do not have sufficient breastmilk, hence, was giving fomula milk.

Now, if we do not put sugar to formula milk, he will not have it. I am giving him Abbott semilac iq+ stage 1. Please let me know what can I do.","Doctor":"Hello. You can keep reducing the sugar content of the milk slowly slowly until you reach a stage where there is no sugar in the milk. Also, you can check for your current milk output to see if even little is there. If even a little is there, please give the child breast for sometime and if the child suckles, let him suckle. After removing from the breast you can give the child some top feeds. That way the child will not stay hungry and your milk output will also increase. Slowly slowly a stage will come wherein your milk output will be enough to satisfy the hunger of the child and you will not need top feeds."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I started Trintellix yesterday for panic, anxiety attacks and today I felt like a lump in my throat, almost like someone is choking me. I am not sure if this is due to the drug and if this is something to worry about? Should I take my next dose today?","Doctor":"Hi. Trintellix is a type of selective Serotonin reuptake inhibitor which work by increasing serotonin levels in blood. The serotonin further treats the anxiety and panic attacks but sometimes SSRI may cause activation like rapid increase of serotonin in blood, which may lead to temporary increase in anxiety. To solve the issue, you can start with half tablet, a dose of 2.5 mg for initial five days, then make it 5 mg and continue it further. If it also does not help you, then contact your psychiatrist."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am 17 years old. and have a littl bit of white nipple disharge in both breasts but one has it a little worse and the skin on my nipple appears to be white and has little blisters on it. It does not really itch or anything but it is sore to the touch.","Doctor":"Hi. I see that you are worried about discharge from both your breasts and you are telling it has blister-like appearance. White discharge with blister-like appearance and sore to touch generally points towards an infection, but an infection occurring simultaneously in both breasts at the same time is very rare. Another possibility, is that milk secretion from both breasts which you might think as white discharge. Do not doubt, there are certain conditions where there can be milk secretion even without pregnancy and birth, which occurs due to hormone disturbances. Need some more information too, Do you have a fever? How are your menstrual cycles? Is it regular? Is the flow high? Do you feel any small lump behind the nipples? Do you take medicines for any other problem? Do not mistake me, but your problem needs a direct clinical examination to visualize the breast, discharge and to see if there are any lumps behind the nipples. You would not be comfortable to post pictures of your discharge and blisters, so I would recommend you to visit a doctor in person and have yourself examined. Meanwhile, do the investigations I have advised and try the medicines given below. Hypothyroidism. Hyperprolactinemia. ? Breast infection. Galactorrhea.

What you can do is use Augmentin 625 mg bd for 10 days, use enteral antifungal Fluconazole 200 mg daily for 10 days, tablet Ibuprofen 400 mg BD for six days.

Was there a history of sexual contact with an unknown woman unprotected prior to the appearance of the lesion, any swellings around your groin, the swelling, is it ulcerated? Is the color same as your normal penis colour or is it darker? Is there any pain on urination?  Based on your presenting symptom, if there was a history of unprotected sex, it may be primary syphilis or penile wart because these do not come with pain.

Do you think that there will be adverse effects of Seroquel on me, such as worsening my situation, intensifying the feelings of fear or making the time of my derealization last longer? What should I do?","Doctor":"Hello. Seroquel is Quetiapine and is an antipsychotic drug, but the drug is also used in mood disorders like bipolar disorder or resistant depression. The drug does not make a person schizophrenic. A lot of psychiatrists use this drug as augmentation therapy for depression or insomnia. If they have prescribed this drug, then remain relaxed. This will not cause any harm to your mental health but will help you. The drug is safe to use and has no severe side effects."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor,I am 24 years old.

On routine examination his eye has a power of minus 3.5 and minus 2.5 refractive error. What is the normal refractive error at this age as refraction continues to change? Doctor said to follow up after six months as glasses may be needed if power increases. Please help.","Doctor":"Hello. First of all, let me tell you that visual development takes until the age of puberty. As your child grows, his vision parameters will change because his eyeball grows with him as he ages. So visual stability will continue to change until the age of 18-20 years old. Normally the child is born with a plus refractive error unlike the case here. Your child has a condition called myopia which is a refractive error with a minus as you said. But that is completely fixable as the child grows whether by glasses, contact lenses, or LASIK surgery if it continues and he needs to take glasses off later. The most important examination in his age is something called a red reflex. You should ask your doctor if he has done it to him. Also, I would ask about the fundus examination too. If both were normal, I would not have any concerns. I want to reassure you that your child's eyes are in good health. He just needs to be examined precisely every follow up every six months as your doctor suggested, just to make sure everything is going right and to treat anything if something happens early. The glasses will not be tolerated by a child as his age is too small, as soon as he can tolerate glasses, put them on. That could happen in two years. If you need further assistance do not hesitate to contact me."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am a 44-year-old female. My height is 161 cm and weight 87 kg. Clarify one doubt about an antidepressant.

But I somehow manage to complete the work also but with a lot of effort. Will the medicine take time to set? Why do I have these symptoms?","Doctor":"Hello.  Antidepressant take around two weeks to show their effect as this much time is required to make changes in chemicals present in the brain. The symptoms you mentioned are typical of depression. Stalopam (Escitalopram) and Uvox CR (Fluvoxamine) both are antidepressant from SSRI (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor) group but somewhat different profile. In the next few days, you will see some relief as 10 days already passed since starting on Uvox CR. Also, check your thyroid status as you are already on Thyroxine75 mcg and check that this dose is sufficient or not. Meanwhile, do regular exercise and go for a walk for at least 45 minutes, five times a week. Maintain good sleep hygiene and spend time on your hobbies. I hope it clarifies your concern and feel free to ask if anything unanswered."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, When I try to masturbate or when I am thinking of it, I became very nervous, and a little fainted. I do not know why.","Doctor":"Hello. Well, in this case, the jerk you had in your first experience is called ejaculation. I am sure you did not take any libido-enhancing drug cause that may also amplify the symptoms. And usually, there is adrenalin surge during ejaculation, which can cause a sudden increase in your heart rate, nervousness and eventually tiredness during ejaculation. After the entire process is over, then eventually you will become calm. I guess your fear may be stemmed from your first experience. Those symptoms you felt are normal for every man who has sex when it is time to ejaculate. It is not a problem. It is a normal physiological respond during ejaculation. So relax, nothing to worry about you are fine. I believe your subsequent experience will make you understand that it is normal.

I see that you need to perform the following tests to see if you have acquired diabetes and/or anemia related to vitamin B12 deficiency. In case the test results are negative and the symptoms resolve in the coming days then there is no need to worry. If the condition continues despite negative result in the tests, then I suggest taking Vitamin B complex supplement, like the one I will mention in the treatment part.

I understand your concern and would first recommend performing an EEG (electroencephalography) and a brain MRI to exclude any possible brain lesions that may lead to seizures. As seizures are persistent, I would recommend starting antiepileptic drugs. In this regard, considering your age, and the fact that you are overweight, I would suggest starting low dose Levetiracetam or Carbamazepine.

The genital part does not stand properly. Right now, I am taking 1000 mg L-Arginine once daily. Can you please solve my problem?","Doctor":"Hello, Welcome to the icliniq.com. For your erectile dysfunction problem, you have to rule out organic cause like thickening of an artery supplying penis due to fat deposition. It is called atherosclerosis thickening of the artery. For that color Doppler ultrasound, penile angiography can be done. USG (ultrasound) testes and serum testosterone estimation also need to be done. I suggest you avoid stress if you are having anxiety or stressful event history (psychological cause like stress is also associated with erectile dysfunction). You have to check your blood pressure and serum cholesterol values as well. Obesity also can be responsible for erectile dysfunction. So lose your weight. Take more fruit juices, especially pomegranates juice once daily at night. Regular exercise, yoga, meditation can be beneficial. If there is no improvement in one to two months, then we will discuss further. I hope I have answered your question.

Left eye pain and hot feeling in your head is due to severe mechanical stress to your body because of extreme mental exertion and lack of sleep for three days. As a neurologist, my first advice will be to take some rest and be relaxed and calm. To take rest and enough sleep at least five to six hours in a day is a part of exam preparation. Sleep is a must for better and powerful performance in an exam. It will refuel and restart our brain. Sleep will help to build up and potentiate our memory.

You can start diet modification like, 1. Have adequate fluid intake. 2. Avoid dry fruits, cold drinks, and chocolate. 3. Avoid broccoli, spinach, beans, and non-vegetarian diet. I would highly recommend testing uric acid once again after one month to reassess the uric acid value. As a single high value should not be the basis for starting medical treatment. Because the treatment usually has to be continued for a long period. So begin the diet modification from today, and repeat uric acid after a month, and review again for further advice. As a patient with high uric acid has an increasing tendency to form renal calculi, I will also advise sonography of abdomen and pelvis, if already not done, before the surgery. Uric acid, RFT (renal function test), sonography of abdomen and pelvis.

I have been experiencing on and off acid reflux for a few weeks as well as mild dysphagia (strangely only at breakfast). I am afraid of esophageal cancer. I do not smoke and drink. I exercise regularly, and I am not overweight. I have no family history of any cancer. I do suffer from anxiety issues, though, and I have pollen allergies.","Doctor":"Hello. First, I would like to reassure you that dysphagia and reflux symptoms are very common and more common than esophageal cancer. I want to reassure you that this is very unlikely to be esophageal cancer. Esophageal cancer is more common in older patients who have a history of smoking and or alcohol abuse. In patients with reflux symptoms, those symptoms are usually longstanding, and progress to Barrett's esophagus before any cancer develops. I think that you have gastroesophageal reflux and I think your symptoms can be easily managed. 1. Start an over-the-counter reflux medication. I recommend Ranitidine 150 mg every 12 hours. It takes about 30 minutes to start working, and you can take this as soon as you get up in the morning. 2. Make sure to not eat for two to three hours before going to bed. 3. Avoid spicy or acidic foods, especially for breakfast when you complain you have the most symptoms. This would include avoiding ketchup, citric fruit juices, coffee, and tea. Try to eat a very bland diet for the next two to four weeks and see if that improves. Eggs and toast, for example, caffeine can cause acid, and so I recommend avoiding coffee and tea. If you must have it (as I can understand), try to wait until later in the morning and make sure that you have any coffee or tea with food (even just a dry piece of toast). If your symptoms have not improved in one month, you may need to see a gastroenterologist to be evaluated for esophagitis or an ulcer."},{"Patient":"Hello, I am a 25 year old person.

My verbal communication skill is proper and organized if and only if I am focused and conscious at that moment. Otherwise, I tend to be unprofessional and non-intelligent in speaking. Even when a friend illogically shouts over me, I cry over phone and still keep talking in gentle manner. My logic remains in my mind, but I just cannot speak out, which in turn disturbs me later. Sometimes, I get angry by thinking I could not stand verbally for myself at the right time. In the past I was taking Trinicalm plus. What is the problem?

I have attached the OPG scan for your reference. I would like to know, from the OPG, what is your opinion about the extent of decay? And also I would like to know about the possible diagnosis. Thank you.","Doctor":"Hi. Before I answer, I would like to point out a few issues here. You have not mentioned the location of your tooth pain, whether it is on the right or left side. The right and left indicator on the orthopantomograph (OPG) are not visible on the scanned image. So, I am going to describe the findings as I see it. To my right and left, I can see there is decay in two upper molar teeth. Upper third tooth from my right and the upper third tooth from my left.The decay in the upper right first molar appears to be deep. Depending on the symptoms, if you have acute pain that is unchanged, persistent and disturbs your sleep, then the tooth will require root canal treatment (RCT). This is because the nerve of the tooth (pulp) has been involved by the decay. If the RCT is started right away, the tooth can be saved. The decay in the upper left molar tooth is moderately deep and can be filled, if you get it done right away. If delayed, then the decay is likely to progress and involve the nerve of the tooth (pulp), then root canal treatment would be the only option to save the tooth."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I have severe ankylosing spondylitis since 19 years.

I do a little bit of sport. I eat a balanced diet. I have fatigue and headache when I do anaerobic exercise, and when I read a book. According to my doctor, my average blood pressure is 12.8 or 12.7. All my family members are in good health. My mother's sister has osteoporosis. Reading a book or something else gives me headache and fatigue, so I need to rest after reading something. When I need to read something I must drink a lot of water to be less tired, because if I do not drink a lot of water before reading I need to rest five times more than the usual. Because of this reason, I have stopped my schooling. I got my standard blood test, TSH and lipid test done, I used to do running of one hour by weekend. I want to do home body building like push-up, but I cannot do it like I used to do before. I do not know why my anaerobic capacity has decreased a lot in the last three years. When I do some push-ups or another anaerobic exercise like 100 m speed running, I have really bad results; I take too much time to do this kind of exercise. I am abnormally getting breathless and my heart beats fast. I was not like that before six years, but my physical appearance has not changed. I must drink 1 liter of water 35 minutes before running, if I do not then I cannot even stand for ten minutes. If I drink a lot of water like 1 liter, 40 minutes before, I can do 70 push-ups at the first series, but If I drink only one or two glasses of water 10 minutes before, I cannot do 45 push-ups and my heart begin to beat hard and I am completely breathless and tired. After a running session of 40 minutes to one hour, immediately when I begin to do my legs muscles stretching even if I am completely relaxed and feel good, without any breathlessness also. When I do my stretching my heart begins to beat very fast and hard and I begin to be breathless. Then I must wait and drink water and do my stretching very slowly. I have never felt this before, and I used to work at school with pleasure, read some books and do sport more easily. My wear has a strange smell after sport. It smells something like a rotten wood plank. It is a smooth bad odor not too much aggressive but really unusual. The few doctors I have seen do not know what the source of the problem is, but we found that I do not have a good thermoregulation because I am cold and need a lot of clothes. It seems like I feel better when I am in vasodilation period like under the sun or in a hot place. So, I tried a supplement called Citrulline six months ago, to have more arginine in the body to have a better vasodilation. Indeed, I feel really less tired since I take the Citrulline. I feel like my muscle cells and other tissue are more supplied in something that I need in these cells. Citrulline helped a bit, but it did not resolve the problem. Hope you could help me. Thank you.","Doctor":"Hi. All your clinical problems appear to be related to anaerobic respiration. Based on your query, my opinion is as follows: For respiration, oxygen is most important - Anaerobic respiration mainly occurs because of reduced oxygen. You might require a lung function tests to evaluate for adequate oxygenation. If you are a smoker or exposed to pollution, dust or industrial exposure, it can get affected. Anemia requires evaluation. Hope your hemoglobin level is within normal limits. Get a hemogram done. Anaerobic respiration leads on to lactic acid production. This lactic acid accumulation causes muscle pain and tiredness. Do get your lactic acid accumulation level in blood evaluated before and after the exercise. Lactic acid level requires correlation with possible muscle storage disorders or dystrophies compared to exercise; there may be increased lactic acid production. Hydration would be washing of this lactic acid, which is possibly making you feel better. Meet a biochemist to get yourself tested for lactic acid increase and possible causes. Sweat glands can produce abnormal smell depending on diet. Look into your diet closely. Citrulline produces nitric oxide leading on to vasodilatation. It could be removing some amount of lactic acid or increasing oxygenation, but overall the main cause from lungs to blood and blood to muscle requires identification. Get the tests for hemoglobin level, lung function tests along with oxygen saturation and serum lactic acid. If all are normal, then muscle glycogen storage disorders or muscle biopsy for any pathology maybe necessary."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I have itching in the penis area.

Could I be in preterm?","Doctor":"Hello. You have not mentioned your gynecological, obstetrics, menstrual and drug history. Have you previously had a normal delivery? If no, then the body prepares itself for normal vaginal delivery in the third trimester. In the first time mother, this process is long as it is happening for the first time. So, it takes more time than mothers who already had labor and normal delivery. Everyone's threshold for pain and body's reaction to late perineal changes in the third trimester and labor are different. Only mild cramps without severe contractions episodic going towards lower pelvis from the back are Braxton Hicks and it does not show labor changes in the cervix. Pressure symptoms, bladder heaviness, and recurrent urine are usual symptoms in the third trimester as the baby is mostly in cephalic presentation and growing size creates pressure in neighboring organs naturally. But precautions are necessary. It is better to differentiate between just Braxton Hicks and labor pains with cervical changes. Preterm delivery having lots of factors like infection, fetal, and maternal anomalies and diseases, rupture membranes, etc. Pain threshold relation to cervical changes is different for everyone. I cannot rule out that back cramping, the pressure in bum and vagina cannot lead to preterm delivery but there are factors behind that also that need to sort out. Otherwise, backache, pressure symptoms, mild labor like pains are normal symptoms in most of the women in late pregnancy. I hope you get my point. If there is a pain in the third trimester, we need to check with baby monitoring and mother's cervical changes with the strength of contractions. I hope u get my point. In case of labor-like frequent contractions, rupture of membranes and reduced fetal movements, you need to report to the hospital for monitoring and examination.

I feel very uncomfortable when I meet my girlfriend or talk with her in the phone about some hot topic because my penis becomes erect when she touch or hug me, and there is a seminal fluid is a discharge. What can I do for these problems?","Doctor":"Hello. I can understand your concern about your symptoms. Many research says the average length of a flaccid penis is 3.61 inches, while the average length of an erect penis is 5.16 inches. Few studies recommended flaccid penis length of less than 1.6 inches or an erect penis of less than three inches should be considered for treatment. Pre-ejaculatory fluid when you are with your partner is normal. Considering your age, you will be fine in a few days. Normal sex time can be from 3 to 20 minutes, depending on the experience and stamina."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I have low blood pressure and am suffering with low pain in the heart for the past two days.","Doctor":"Hi. We define low blood pressure if the reading is lower than 90 mm Hg systolic or 60 mm Hg diastolic or if the patient has symptoms which are lightheadedness, dizziness, fainting, blurred vision or lack of concentration. These symptoms are most prominent when individuals go from the lying or sitting position to the standing position. The causes of low blood pressure could be endocrine problems, dehydration, blood loss, severe infection (septicemia), severe allergic reaction (anaphylaxis), or lack of nutrients in your diet. My advice to you is to eat a diet higher in salt, drink a lot of fluid especially in hot weather and while sick with a viral illness. And for your case, try to measure your blood pressure before and after taking normal saline. If there is no change, you can talk to an endocrine specialist. For more information consult an endocrinologist online -->"},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I had protected sex with a woman. After a few days, I had an itch at the bottom of one of my ears. After 12 days, I done an HIV RNA PCR test and it was negative. After a few days, I had a wart-like bump in the shaft of my penis and body itching. Then after 60 days, I have done HIV duo combo test and it was negative. In these days, I had intense itching with rash similiar at the bottom of both of my ears. After 90 days, I have done the ELISA test, test for hepatitis A and B, herpes, syphilis, chlamydia, and they were negatives. After a few days, I had small itchy red bumps in the body. After 225 days, I done HIV tridot test and it was negative. But the itching in the body with bumps continues. Now I am 314th day after sex. What should I do? Should I go for another HIV test or other STD tests?","Doctor":"Hi,  Welcome to icliniq.com. I have gone through the case. In my opinion, if you have no contact history for almost a year then there is no need to repeat all the tests. But first, you need detailed physical examination because there are different types of itchy red bumps and some of these are linked to sex and some are not. So do not go for all tests at once."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am a 27-year-old man. Sometimes, I feel very weak. My BP goes down and I am unable to stand properly. Also, there is a pain in my foot. Please tell me the treatment to cover this type of problem.","Doctor":"Hello. You have two main concerns. The weakness is not due to low blood pressure. The low blood pressure can lead to dizziness and inability to stand as described by you. For that try to maintain hydration with lots of water and whenever you feel dizziness take salted food and fruit juices. You can check your blood sugar level as well. For tiredness, I suggest you investigate with serum potassium, serum sodium estimation, serum TSH (thyroid stimulating hormone) estimation, CBC (complete blood count), liver profile, and kidney profile. You can revert back with reports. For pain in the foot, avoid prolonged standing or walking. It is advisable to investigate with X-ray foot for further work up. You should get checked your serum calcium and vitamin D level as well."},{"Patient":"Dear doctor, Sometimes I get low BP, low sugar blackouts and palpitations. Please advise.","Doctor":"Hi. Low blood pressure may be due to genetic factors. Do you have a family history of low blood pressure? Hydration and correction of electrolytes might help you. Mix one teaspoon of Electral powder (essential electrolytes) in a glass of water and drink thrice a day for a month. Low blood sugar and blackouts can occur if you do not eat your meals on time. Make sure you eat more frequent smaller meals, once in two hours. Alternatively, you can carry Hypotab tablets that contain a fixed dose of glucose. Pop it in when you feel a blackout coming. Palpitation can occur if your hemoglobin level is low. Include green leafy vegetables in your diet. If your blood counts are not good, you might need a supplement. Get a complete blood count done and get back with the results to a general medicine physician online -->"},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am a 75-year-old male. I had IHD 40 years back. 23 years back, my doctor asked me to add Ismo 10 mg twice a day. Since then, I am taking it twice a day uninterruptedly. Then I was 54 years old. My BP has always been normal in all these years. Maybe 150/80 or 140/90 till a few years back. Now it is in normal level say 120/80, 120/73, 115/70, etc. Since a year, I am experiencing low blood pressure at times, giving me vertigo-like dizziness for 1 hour or 2 only in the early mornings and when I take Vertin, it subsides after 1 or 2 hours. Recently, I went to a well-known cardiologist in my area. He checked me and said that I have systemic hypertension and I need not take Ismo any longer as I do not need it. The BP at that time was 130/70. Before my going to the above cardiologist also I have experienced these levels like 120/70, 110/69, 125/75 likewise. He further said after stoppage of Ismo, the BP levels come to normal levels and I will not experience dizziness anymore. But, I am afraid of stopping the Ismo abruptly for fear of getting an anginal attack, which I have never experienced. I am afraid whether to ask my doctor about this. So, I have stopped taking one dose of Ismo 10 mg during the night. Slowly I shall stop the other doses also in due course. Kindly give me your valuable advice about Ismo, about stopping Ismo and dizziness. Is there any harm if I stop one dose? Does long usage of Ismo trigger low blood pressure and vertigo? Please enlighten me on this subject.","Doctor":"Hello. Firstly, Ismo (Isosorbide Mononitrate) is given for angina or chest pain. If one is not having it without Ismo then it may be stopped. So it is not an absolutely necessary medicine in absence of angina. Next thing, it can cause low BP, and low bp can cause dizziness. But, you mentioned, the lowest BP recorded was 110 systolic, and it is not too low to cause dizziness usually. Have you checked your BP while you being dizzy? So this BP can cause dizziness but not usually. Next thing, you said the response to Vertin (Betahistine), which is not likely in Ismo or hypotension induced dizziness. Vertin is for vertigo induced from the internal ear which is a very common problem. Also, importantly. dizziness induced by hypotension or Ismo will occur on standing or walking, but not while lying down or resting. So if it occurs on lying down as well or on neck movements then it is likely from the internal ear. Next, you should get one echo done to rule out the decrease in heart function as BP is remaining on the lower side. So overall, just go through the above description, and try to decide whether it is Ismo induced or from the internal ear, and you may stop Ismo as advised by the local cardiologist. Also, echo is necessary."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, Is low blood pressure of 102/72 anything to worry about?","Doctor":"Hello. No, low blood pressure is not to be worried much but you should take little high protein diet and sodium diet. Keep an active lifestyle and eat lots of fruits and vegetables to maintain good blood pressure and keep away the weakness. Keep getting your blood parameters checked as it is beneficial for one to stay updated with your vital parameters."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, My mother found a lump in her breast, which is movable and mildly painful.

What should I do? It happened yesterday and icing did not help. Currently, I am under medication for high blood pressure.","Doctor":"Hi. First this to rule out is a foreign body in the eye. For that ask someone to examine your eye with a torchlight and also check the upper lid by everting it because that is the common site for foreign body. Sometimes a very small foreign body cannot be seen with the naked eye and need an eye exam by a doctor. Wash your eye with clean water. If there is no foreign body seen then it is most probably conjunctivitis (that presents with the same symptoms) usually viral conjunctivitis. It usually takes 7-10 days to complete recovery but during this period protect your other eye and other family members because it spreads from one person to another through contact. For symptomatic relief, keep washing your eyes with cold water and do icepacks. That helps to relieve discomfort. Start antibiotic (Moxifloxacin 0.5%) eye drops four times a day to avoid secondary infection. If pain and discomfort are severe consult your nearby eye doctor for a complete eye exam."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I have red spots on my hands that started about 10 days ago.

I had blood, ultrasound, and ECG (electrocardiogram) tests done, and so far, I have no answers as what is causing it. Is there anything they can do to help the symptoms at this point or do I have to put up with it and hope they find a cause and treat.","Doctor":"Hello. The probable cause in you is a cardiac arrhythmia. Firstly, were these episodes witnessed by others? And I guess there are tonic clonic movements as seen in seizures. Also, any precipitating events like stress, urination or passing stool, etc., this is to rule out the possibility of vasovagal syncopes. So, considering the likely possibility of cardiac arrhythmia and recurrent syncopes, there is an option of electrophysiological studies which can answer the cause. Otherwise, we will have to wait and watch until the episode of arrhythmia recurs and captured on ILR (implantable loop recorder). But, if you are having symptoms at present and there is nothing on ILR, then it cannot be a cardiac arrhythmia. So, if you are symptoms at present, then ILR should be interrogated, and if asymptomatic, then electrophysiological studies is an option. Otherwise, wait and watch. I hope this helps you and get back if you have any doubts."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I have small red bumps on both sides of the bottom corners of my mouth. They look like small pimples, but they are not very bumpy. It seems like it is more just redness in little pimple areas rather than actual bumps like pimples would be. I was given Metronidazole and I used it twice a day for 30 days and it seemed to get a little better at the start, but the problem still persists. I have had this problem for six months and I have scheduled a visit with a dermatologist, but it will not be for a few months. I am not sure if this is relevant, but I work with pig guts, so, maybe I got something from them, but I am not sure since I have been working for almost five months before I got these symptoms. One thing I have noticed is that in the morning it looks like it has improved, but then by the end of the day it looks like it is back to normal. I am not sure what the problem is and am not sure if it can be treated without a prescription, but I am willing to try various things.","Doctor":"Hello. I understand your concern. It seems superficial folliculitis (attachment removed to protect patient identity). In this condition you get small red lesions with yellowish pustules.

My period is fairly regular and lasts for 7 days. This time I did experience mild PMS symptoms and stomach cramps prior to onset. My period was five days earlier. And this time, period lasted for only two days but the flow was proper as always. Is there something I need to worry about?","Doctor":"Hello. Firstly, a single episode of early menstruation with normal flow does not qualify for being labeled as a case of polymenorrhea. Secondly, as you have been protected during intercourse, an implantation lasting for two complete days is also unlikely. So, you are pregnancy safe. Thirdly, the early withdrawal is likely to be stress induced hormonal imbalance especially progesterone level during this cycle which caused PMS (premenstrual syndrome) and menstrual cramps in this cycle. So, there is no actual need to be worried. Just maintain a menstrual calendar for next three months to understand the pattern of bleed. If the pattern continues then a hormonal profile and an ultrasound pelvis shall be required. But as of now, no intervention or investigation advised. Just increase your water intake and if not then try yoga and meditation which are great stress busters."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I noticed that for the past three months, I have had vaginal infection.

Over three months I have been having bouts of weakness in shoulders, arms and sides of stomach. I feel very weak and strange. I do not feel dizzy. Sometimes it starts with a hot flash. Or else I will stay awake with this terrible feeling and will have hot flash at the end of it. I had CBC. As my symptoms become worse I went to an urgent care and the doctor took 6 vials of blood. He checked many things including EKG, which is normal. My fasting finger prick was 74 and HbA1c 5.6. I have attached the rest of the blood reports.","Doctor":"Hi. I have gone through the details provided by you. All investigations are normal (attachment removed to protect patient identity) such as hemoglobin levels, non-diabetic, with normal resting EKG. So, these are not issue in your case. However, the following are the possibilities. Post menopausal hormone imbalances - You might have increased spurts of estrogen production which are causing the hot flashes. This is common in such menopausal age and requires only mild treatment if there is evidence of the increase. For this, get the following tests done - FSH (follicle stimulating hormone), LH (luteinizing hormone), estradiol and progesterone levels in blood. Hypertension - Get your BP monitored on daily basis at different times of the day and see if there is increase in levels at any point of time. This is again a reason for hot flashes, anger and weakness. It can be cured with mild medicine if found to be present. Check for your thyroid levels. Since you are overweight, there might be a possibility that you are suffering from hypothyroidism. Vitamin D3 levels - this is another reason for general weakness. Now if we go to further serious reasons, then one probability can be TIA (transient ischemic attack), there can be slight loss of blood supply to the brain which might be causing weakness in limbs. I am not sure if this would fit into you as coming to a conclusion requires medical examination which we cannot do online. I would suggest that you send us all reports as mentioned above and also go to a doctor to get full examination done. Only then we can comment on what is the right treatment in your case."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, 2 years and 6 months old with abnormal CBC test results (two tests seven weeks apart).

Presence of diverticulum and ulcer near the pyloric ring. I have constant nausea, bloating, and throat tightness.","Doctor":"Hello. Gastritis is an inflammation of stomach mucosa. It happens due to Helicobacter pylori a bacterial infection, smoking, alcohol and also certain medicines like Aspirin. Presence of diverticulum also causes gastritis. You are taking good medicines to your concern, continue them. You can add Panchsakar Churna 3 gm twice a day with warm water after meals and Arogyavardhini Vati 1tab twice a day after meals.

I had horrible mood swings, one moment I am overly happy, and the next moment I feel depressed. My sleeping schedule is also different than usual.","Doctor":"Hello. Let me answer your questions via some bullets some points to make things easier to understand. 1. You are only 14 years old, and it is very unusual for a significant mood disorder like bipolar mood disorder to manifest at such a young age. However, this does not mean it is impossible but just far less likely. 2. As a young woman at 14 years of age, it can be considered completely to have mood swings and sleep disruption due to premenstrual hormonal changes. Puberty, overall, is a time of huge biological and psychological change and is not uncommon for a person to experience broad mood changes within one day. 3. I feel your mood swings and general well being should have a keen eye kept on them. If you have a severe mental health disorder, it will become clear fairly soon. 4. From your point of view, as long as you are still able to function normally at school and keep up with your academics as well as maintain relatively good social interactions you are very likely not suffering from a severe mental illness like bipolar. Also, consider the extent of your inner sense of personal distress. Sometimes things can seem like the end of the world in puberty but are much less severe when viewed from a different perspective. 5. I think it would be wise if your parents could allow you to see a psychotherapist or counselor regularly going forward for you to unload your feelings in a safe and confidential environment. Also, such a person could keep an experienced eye on you, and if any severe psychiatric symptoms appear, they can be recognized and acted on it correctly. 6. So my final suggestion is to ask your parents if they are willing to help you find a suitably qualified psychologist and counselor that you can see regularly and feel you can trust them with your feelings. Remember if you are unsure about how you feel and if it is reasonable and not something to worry about, it is always better to speak up about how you think, just as you have done here. Should see a clinical psychologist or counsellor regularly."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I went to the chiropractor and got my neck adjusted. I had sore on my neck more in the back left corner then the pain passed down to my left arm. After checking, they said it was a flare-up and to ice it. The next day I had it adjusted again, and he pointed out that I had a swollen lymph node on the left side. I still had sore in the same spot and was worried about my artery and my lymph node. Could my lymph node be painful because they adjusted my neck or because my muscle was sore and irritated?","Doctor":"Hello. I do not think that because of chiropractor there will be any trouble to the lymph node. If the pain is radiating in nature, then it can be related to intervertebral disc injury which can be a past injury and due to which you had a sore neck. As the intervertebral discs are located in between the two vertebral bodies and the muscles are the supporting structures any trouble to the disc can first make the muscle sore and change the normal curvature of the cervical spine. The radiating symptoms can arise due to nerve root entrapment by the muscle as well as the intervertebral disc. Having an MRI scan of the cervical spine will be useful to avoid further injuries. Also, doing hot water fermentation will help to reduce the muscle spasm of the cervical spine region and the trapezius muscle by which the normal alignment of the cervical spine is achieved. Using cervical soft collar will help to reduce the mobility of the cervical spine leading to stabilization of the joints and less nerve root entrapment. Exercises like static neck exercises, shoulder stabilization exercises, interscapular muscle strengthening exercises will help to regain the muscle strength and correct the cervical spine alignment. If you have any more questions, you can ask me anytime."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor,I am concerned about a possible raccoon roundworm exposure. I have read that I can take a prophylactic 10-day course of Albenza to keep any eggs from entering my CNS. I might have type 2 diabetes for a while and have put off bloodwork to find out. I am a glaucoma suspect based on the last eye exam. How hard is Albenza on the body? Is it generally well tolerated for many days? Do immediate side effects get better after a few days?","Doctor":"Hello. Albendazole 400 mg single star dose is enough for prophylactic deworming. 10 days course is not required. Usually, it is very safe and is well tolerated. A rare side effect is a seizure, that can happen if the worm is already lying dormant in your CNS. I generally prefer a three-day course of Mebendazole 100 mg twice daily as it does not enter CNS and so there are no changes of seizures. I hope it helps.

Should I be telling him to get a pancreas MRI done?","Doctor":"Hello. I just read your query and from what you have mentioned I would like to say that the reason that your insulin levels are dropping is because of your beta cells of the pancreas are getting exhausted and are not gradually decreasing the production of insulin. Pancreatic cancer does not have these manifestations at all. So testing for cancer without any strong family history or clinical manifestations is just not recommended. Continue with your healthy lifestyle and try to workout more as they reduce insulin resistance and thereby decrease fatigue of your pancreatic cells.

I stopped Ranitidine one week ago. I had endoscopy last week and esophagus and stomach looked fine. Could it be gallstones blocking pancreas? Hope you can help me here.","Doctor":"Hi. I have reviewed your query and can well understand your worries. I would recommend combatting this situation without medications as these medications will also affect your stomach. Try not to take pain medications as much as possible. In severe and unbearable pain you can take though. You already had fundoplication and taking pain medications can cause gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) or gastric ulcers along with hyperacidity in the stomach. Without having a look at gallbladder it is difficult to say anything about the origin of issue that may have caused pancreatic insufficiency. For diagnosing gallbladder issues (sludge accumulation inside or gallstones) we need to go for an empty stomach ultrasound study of the abdomen. It can show most of the gallbladder issues along with any correlation between the gallbladder and pancreatic issues like gallstones and pancreatic insufficiency. Alcohol is not good for the pancreas. It is the single most dangerous threat to the pancreatic normal functions. It may also lead to pancreatic cancer along with smoking, age, and infection of the pancreas. It is not severe.

The symptom you are experiencing is called tinnitus. Tinnitus is not always due to a sinister cause. Simple conditions of the ear like wax or ear infections both of external ear canal and middle ear can cause it.

Has it been there only for a month? Is it associated with any decreased hearing? Is it there in both ears? Is the tinnitus accompanied by vertigo or vomiting sensation or fullness in ears? Have you done any testing for the same? When a patient comes to us with symptoms like yours we ask for all these details in history to rule out any neuroma in the nerve or age-related hearing loss or Meniere's disease. A basic investigation that we ask is pure tone audiogram. Additionally, I would suggest you get a SISI (short increment sensitivity index) test done. These two should give us a fair idea and help us rule out the above conditions and check for the cause of tinnitus. If the tinnitus does not have any cause we can help you tolerate it using tinnitus matching and masking. Some centers also provide tinnitus retraining therapy. These are useful.

Two months ago, I fell ill with a bad flu (may have been also an acute viral infection) with high temp (39 degrees), probable inflammation in the sinuses, nose, and throat and sinuses pain. The first antibiotic (Klacid) did not help much and low temp of 37.3 to 37.5 persisted for weeks. Then a throat swab analysis showed the presence of streptococcal pneumonia. However, X-rays of sinuses and lungs did not show any problems.In the meantime, a month ago, the nose cleared, and the pain in sinuses subsided. However, the right ear got clogged for a week, and as it unclogged, the left one got clogged. In the meantime, local doctors gave the diagnosis of post-viral infection-caused inflammation of the eustachian tubes. A second antibiotic was prescribed and taken two weeks ago - Augmentin. After the second antibiotic, temperature normalized. However, the left ear clogging persisted.Additionally, three weeks ago, shortly after the clogging of the left ear, a high-pitched noise in the left ear appeared (tinnitus ?), which is particularly audible at night and has caused me sleeplessness, stress, and depression.

The clogging of ears and ringing sensation (tinnitus) are probably due to accumulation of fluid in your middle ear post eustachian tube blockage, as a result of the upper respiratory tract infection you had had previously, a condition known as serous otitis media.

Please say about other symptoms whether you had snoring, interrupted sleep, unrefreshed sleep, and morning headaches. If you had these symptoms, it supports the diagnosis. It is a condition characterized by obstruction of upper airway especially during sleep due to narrowing of airway due to obesity. Obstruction of upper airway leads to temporary stoppage of respiration, increased sympathetic drive, and increased pulse rate. Also, another reason for pulse rate rise is deconditioning as you are not accustomed to activities. You can do ENT examination if you have nasal stiffness, and recurrent tonsillitis to rule out the nasal causes of obstruction. You can also do a thyroid function test, lipid profile, sugar, Hba1c, vitamin D, and polysomnography. Polysomnography is a sleep study used to confirm the diagnosis and to know the extent of the disease. CPAP (continuous positive airway pressure) is needed. You have to reduce weight. It is the first line of treatment. You need to have low fat, and a low-calorie diet to lose weight. Secondly, CPAP is a mask and device, and the pressure during inspiration and expiration during sleep keeps your airways patent and avoid this from happening. Also, regular exercise is essential. Chest physiotherapy and yoga will be helpful.

But I advise you to do it under the supervision of a nearby gynecologist because egg size is important while conception and that you can know by ovulation study.

I went to a urgent care as I had chest pain, they did an ECG and blood test and told me that there is nothing to worry about heart and they told, I may have GERD and gave me some acidity medication. I had a follow up with an ENT as I was having a headache. The ENT doctor told me that I have a sinus infection. I took antibiotics given by the doctor for seven days to get some relief but, still, there is tiredness, feeling of sleepy and some discomfort in my throat and neck.

Currently, I am taking Amoxicillin, Fluticasone, Prednisone, Ranitidine tablets.","Doctor":"Hi. It may be due to sleep apnea or obstructive sleep apnea. Frequent awakening while sleeping that is unidentifiable to the individual himself causes all the discomfort. It is a disease where we cannot sleep well and we will feel uncomfortable and lazy, you will have no energy and daytime sleepiness is very common. GERD can be a chronic issue. It also adds to the symptoms especially as you have head and neck issues. I can see you are already taking some medications for this. If there is no benefit, consult a Gastroenterologist soon.

For further information consult a pulmonologist online -->"},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, The patient underwent extensive routine physical examination including MR/CT imaging and laboratory analysis earlier this month. The MR Brain shows evidence of lacunar stroke and ischemic brain changes. Please advise if these might be connected to untreated obstructive sleep apnea (more than five years). If so, some recent research indicates that these cerebral changes might be partially reversible with CPAP treatment. Please let me know your professional opinion and suggested investigations and/or treatment.","Doctor":"Hello. I carefully went through your question and the patient's medical history. I reviewed her medical report and the uploaded brain MRI study (attachment removed to protect patient identity) and would explain that those changes are indicative of small vessel disease, which means chronic gradual blockage of small vessels inside the brain. I agree with you that untreated sleep apnea, for such a long time, can lead to these brain changes. On the other hand, you should know that other risk factors such as uncontrolled high blood pressure, dyslipidemia, diabetes, age, migraine if present, smoking contacts, obesity, sedentary life, etc., also contribute to these changes, besides sleep apnea. Unfortunately, these brain changes are irreversible. This means that adequate treatment of sleep apnea and a better control of blood pressure values or blood lipid profile, will not make them vanish. But, all these measures will help stop the progression of this disorder and prevent further changes to the brain. You should know that sleep apnea is a known cardiovascular risk factor, which means that it contributes to uncontrolled hypertension and atherosclerosis process (generalized narrowing of blood vessels in the brain, heart and other organs). So, I am sure the CPAP (continuous positive airway pressure) device will help stop the progression of these changes. These brain changes in later stages can lead to dementia and depression or gait disturbances. That is why, it is necessary to keep under control all the above-mentioned risk factors (including sleep apnea), in order to stop the progression of this disorder. I would also recommend checking fasting glucose and blood lipid profile every six months, to be sure that she does not suffer from dyslipidemia or diabetes. It is also advisable to take daily Aspirin of 80 to 100 mg (if there are no contraindications to this drug), in order to prevent the progression and further small strokes in the future. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines with their consent. Hope you will find this answer helpful.

Chronic granulomatous disease (CGD) is an immunodeficiency condition where the white blood cells cannot fight the pathogens effectively which cause different types of infections. As for sleep apnea, it is caused by narrowing of the air passages mostly in the nasopharynx area which cause interrupted night sleep, usually the cause is obesity in short-necked persons or hypertrophied uvula. There is no relation between both except in very rare conditions (Kimura's disease) where CGD causes hypertrophy of the larynx.

Welcome to icliniq. I am Dr Anshul Varshney for your help. It's an excellent drug. Infact it's an elder sister of Pregabalin only. Gabapentin is little more potent then Pregabalin. Only possible side effect of that drug is dizziness but since your mother has been on Pregabalin 150 mg then Gabapentin should suit her. Gabapin NT also contains Nortryptilline, which helps further in neuropathic pain. Dear, if you will check side effects / reviews of any drugs you would get for all. If in doubt, discuss with your doctor once again being empathetic. I use this drug very often and most of the Diabetologists use it.

I have read your concern. You might be worried of the cerebral edema if this will cause any harm. A repeat 48 hour CT scan if with any signs of wakefulness deterioration is warranted if that ever happens. The blood clots is a sequelae of the trauma to the face. Most commonly this is part of the superficial veins near the nostrils called keisselbachs plexus. This will heal. Give it 2 to 3 days until it gets crusted by itself with the help of the antibiotics to lessen chances of infection. If the CT scan is normal other than the mild cerebral edema is seen, then no further medical and neurosurgical procedure is needed. The zygoma fracture and orbital fracture is also not worrisome if does not cause any deformity (like a protruding bone), and does not need any procedure for it if it does not obstruct your visual field or puncture the globe of the eye. I agree with antibiotics and saline spray three times a day. It would also help taking some Ibuprofen to lessen the inflammation and swelling, if taken every eight hours."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I daily take Pristiq antidepressant tablet 50 mg, which doctor had prescribed since a year.

Withdrawal symptoms are scary to me, and I want to completely stop this Pristiq because I tried many times to get it off, but unfortunately, I cannot.

As you are tapering your Pristiq (Desvenlafaxine), there will be no withdrawal at all. You need to restart because of anxiety or depression disorder, not because of withdrawal. 5-HTP (Hydroxytryptophan) is not FDA approved and no guideline for it to how to use and when to use. It is a supplement product, but not a medication to treat. You should follow depression and nonpharmacological management. Do exercises daily for 30 to 45 minutes like walking and practice meditation for 20 minutes daily. Eat healthy home cooked foods, avoid junk foods. Spend quality time with friends and family every day. Spend time for creative hobbies like reading good books, writing journals, painting, drawings, and learning new skills or language or musical instruments. Have enough of 7 to 8 hours of sleep daily.

Or does it lessen the chance of malignancy? I would like to monitor through ultrasound. I am wondering what your thoughts are on this course of action.","Doctor":"Hi. I suggest that surgical correction should be done to bring it down as low as possible. Reason being, it permits self palpation of testis for early detection of any tumor. Frequent ultrasound is not feasible or practical to think of. Self palpation can be done every day. Ultrasound cannot be done every day. Surgery is a minor one.

Uterine perforation usually occurs if abortion is being performed by the use of sharp instruments and vigorous curettage. If the abortion was undertaken with medicines only then, there is no such chance of perforation. Secondly, if perforation was being there, it might have caused your symptoms like pain, fever, bleeding, etc., if it was of considerable size.

Most of the time, lesion heals within four to six weeks. But if the wound is depressed as you have described then it means the scar is formed and unfortunately such injuries are sometimes permanent, but still, some do show response to the laser treatments. Please always try to send a picture for opinion. My advice is according to your description."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor I have history of Thyroid and PCOS, i am taking 50mg of eltroxin. my period is delayed by 6 days .when I tested preganacy test after 4 days of period days two lines are showing but not clearly. please suggest me can I go to doctor for a checkup or wait for 1 week for clear result. or what type of precaution I should take during pregnancy?","Doctor":"Hello, Welcome to Icliniq. I see than you haven't mentioned the date of your last menstrual period. Ideally, if you have had a regular 28days cycles, the urine pregnancy test is usually positive by the time you skip your periods. Delayed ovulation can be common in PCOS, So, I would suggest you to recheck your home pregancy test with an early morning urine sample tomorrow, and exactly at the time interval at which the result has to be read as mentioned on the kit. Sometimes if seen very late , the evaporation line also may seem as faintly positive which is actually a false positive. Early morning urine sample is supposed to be having concentrated levels of the Beta HCG hormone which is detected on the pregnancy kit. So recheck again tomorrow with a morning sample of urine. If you donot have any pain or spotting, you can visit your Gynaecologist at ease, may be in a week, and get an ultrasound done for pregnancy viability and localisation. Meanwhile continue taking folic acid & Eltroxin Medications & recheck your thyroid levels as during the pregnancy the dose may have to be changed due to increased requirements in pregnancy. Hope this helps. Please feel free to revert back anytime for any further queries or Information. - Continue Tablet Folic acid 5mg daily once till 14weeks. - Continue Tablet Eltroxin 50mcg daily once. - Avoid sexual intercourse in the first 4months of pregnancy."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor,I am just wondering what is abutting and abutment of the nerve root means in a back issue.

But I advise you to do it under the supervision of a nearby gynecologist because egg size is important while conception and that you can know by ovulation study.

I am a teen and cannot go to a psychiatrist as my family does not believe me when I tell them and even claim I pretend to have the symptoms. I think there is something wrong with me and want to know.","Doctor":"Hi.  To answer your question regarding ADHD: Most people with ADHD will have displayed signs and symptoms of the disorder from a young age, usually before 12 years old. In this case your ADHD will usually have been noticeable and picked up by teachers or parents at a younger age. However, many cases can be missed and only picked up later. In this case I recommend referral to a general practitioner who can more reliably assess the situation. A referral to a psychiatrist can always be made, if necessary. This is also bearing in mind that there can be multiple reasons why you might find difficulties concentrating. Therefore, it is better to proceed slowly and start with a GP consultation before jumping into any treatment of ADHD which can involve powerful medications that can have serious side effects. A screening test for ADHD like the Conner’s test filled in by both the child’s teacher and parents. To be seen for a thorough examination by a family practitioner. If there is evidence of potential ADHD, then referral to a psychiatrist or child and a dole scent psychiatrist would be the next step. As per the findings of the GP or psychiatrist. The young patients symptoms should not be completely ignored and a proper thorough investigation should be done in order that something potentially serious is not missed."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am writing a fiction novel about scientific abnormalities. I think there is no better professional than a doctor to ask this. What would happen if a tumor is left untouched in a human? What happens after the tumor takes over their life? Would it eventually conquer all of the victim's body? What would be the end result? Would it count as a separate organism once it overtakes the body? This question is not meant to disturb your work, it is only for the development of ideas. If you find this question unethical or offensive please ignore it.","Doctor":"Hello. Tumor basically consists of cells with unregulated capacity to multiply and spread. So, if tumor is not removed, then its size keep on increasing. Also, it spreads to different organs through blood and other tissues, and occupies other organ as well. So, normal tissues or organ throughout the body is invaded by tumor cells which cannot carry out the normal function of the organ, so organ failure ensues. So, one organ failure leads to other and eventually heart stops and person dies. So, human body is invaded by cells which causes dysfunction in the body and eventually body stop working (means death) before going ahead. But, we cannot consider it as separate or new organism because new cells are not functional and cannot form organs to make a new organism. For imaginary purpose, you can think in a way you mentioned of transforming or replacing one individual with other or person who has acquired some new characteristics due to tumor cells, etc., but does not occur in reality."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, This is really nerve racking but I noticed these growth on my shaft (fold area) that are very small and round.

According to your complaints, you may have erectile dysfunction (ED). Reason for erectile dysfunction includes, 1. Decrease sensation of the penis that can be due to infection, diabetes, spinal injury, and recent masturbation. 2. Stress due to work or family related and night duties. 3. Depression, varicocele, homosexuality, and religious constraints. 4. Fear of failure - having one episode of ED once may make you feel you will end up with ED. 5. Low self-esteem (chronic masturbation). 6. Long term illness like cardiac disease, thyroid disease, kidney disease, and any other disease with long term medication. 7. Negative attitude towards your partner. .8. Hormonal issues like a thyroid issue, low testosterone. 9. Long term drug usage. 10. Diabetes and hypertension.

The information and opinions are mind-numbing and confusing. I have the choice of taking my daughter to a pediatrician or a psychiatrist, after having her tested by a psychologist for school performance related issues. The resulted report indicates that she has serious trouble in concentrating (we knew that) and that she is exhibiting anxiousness (we knew that too). She is currently taking 20 mg Ritalin LA, and we need to re-evaluate the medication.In your professional opinion, where should one start? Will it be sufficient taking her to a pediatrician to re-evaluate the medication, or should I take her to a child psychiatrist for a full evaluation?","Doctor":"Hello. You have asked a very pertinent question. I am not sure about the medical system in your area. Usually, young children in primary school are seen by pediatricians. Once they move to secondary school and if they have any co-morbid conditions like depression or anxiety, they are usually seen by child psychiatrists. But this arrangement is not universal, and there are huge variations. Both developmental pediatricians and child psychiatrists have the training and expertise to assess and manage ADD or ADHD (attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder). So if you are comfortable with your current pediatrician, discuss your concerns with him or her about your daughter's anxiety. If appropriate, they can refer your daughter to a child psychiatrist. Perhaps your daughter's response to Ritalin LA (Methylphenidate) and tolerability needs to be reviewed, and dose has to be titrated accordingly. If there are any emotional difficulties, she will benefit from pastoral support at school or some counseling. If emotional problems are severe, getting a child psychiatrist opinion may be sensible. Also, we have to remind ourselves that the management of ADD or ADHD is not medication alone. Your daughter will benefit from individualized support to help with her school performance. Her self-esteem should not be affected by ADD. Let her enjoy doing activities which can provide positive experiences. If she likes sports or drama or any other similar field, let her have regular time for pursuing her interests."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am suffering from depression.

You have described facing several adverse childhood experiences like losing your mother, and indifferent father addicted to alcohol and lack of loving support while growing up. These adverse life events could have potentially affected your feelings like, making you feel low, affect your self-esteem, and cause suicidal thoughts. Anyone in your situation would have probably felt the same. It is good to know that you had some support from a friend before. It is important not to isolate yourself when you are feeling like this. Try to meet supportive people regularly. If you are in education or doing a job, try to speak to a senior person and see whether they can be a mentor to support and guide you. If you are spiritual, try visiting holy places regularly if you find it helpful. You have said that you feel happy when you are around the people and low again when lonely, this is understandable. People feel better in practical social situations. You will also benefit by consulting a doctor who can do a full assessment of the nature and severity of your symptoms, and it will clarify whether you have clinical depression. Try to speak to your friend and family and make sure you get help. You may need some counseling support or therapy to help you move forward in life. Equally important is self-help measures like eating healthily, sleeping well, exercise regularly, keeping yourself gainfully occupied, and having positive social relationships."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, Five months old baby suffered from loose motion and fewer doctors gave Ofloxacin 50 mg and Flagyl 200 mg syrup.

I am having a HbA1c of 7 (recently tested a few days back) and has a problem of tearing my frenulum during intercourse with my partner. I have consulted two urology doctors. The first one says I need a circumcision as there are frequent infections in glans due to sugar levels. Whereas second doctor recommends a frenuloplasty. I am confused. The first doctor says since I have frequent infections due to frequent raised sugar levels, I get smegma quite often in my glans. Please advise me if I need to go for the frenuloplasty or circumcision.","Doctor":"Hi. First of all, I appreciate you for providing elaborate history which will help in making diagnosis and advising treatment plan. Now, coming to your health query, I can understand your concern and will try to help you. Your diabetes is quite well controlled as per your HbA1c. However, the cause of tear in frenulum occurs due to short frenulum and not always due to infection. Though chances of infection are high in diabetes, usually it causes balanoposthitis and difficulty in retraction of foreskin, which is not the case with you. Smegma is normal secretion under the foreskin and is not a cause for concern, as long as you keep cleaning it. As far as proposed surgery is concerned, though frenuloplasty is sufficient surgery for short frenulum, circumcision can get rid of both short frenulum as well as smegmatic collection under foreskin. Hence, my advise is circumcision."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I had sex with a sex worker a day before yesterday. But I told her not to remove her dress because I did not have a condom.

Cetaphil moisturizer for body twice a day. 3. Tablet Desloratadine 5 mg twice a day. For acne use the following medicines. 1. Fixed combination of Adapalene 0.1 % and Benzoyl peroxide 2.5 % gel for local application at night. The gel needs to be applied very gently as spots on acne and a thin layer over the acne-prone site, and it is not to be rubbed. It can cause mild irritation upon initial use, which can subside with continued usage. It is nothing to worry about. Use the medicines given above. It should decrease in two to three weeks after which you can follow up again. It does not look like anything that should raise your concern. The spot appears to be an excoriated lesion of acne.

Right now the platelet count is 40,000. Please suggest a solution for this.","Doctor":"Hi. Your father was on medication and has history of urine retention in the past. Currently, he is on catheter. Chances of medical management will not be successful. He needs surgery of either TURP (transurethral resection of the prostate) or HoLEP (Holmium laser enucleation of the prostate) for prostate. Size is never a criteria for surgery. Enlarged prostate can shrink by 30% if Dutasteride is given. But, this does not guarantee that the patient will become catheter free. However, it reduces blood vessels in prostate and helps decrease blood loss in surgery. Dutas-T (Dutasteride and Tamsulosin) also contains similar medicines as Silodal D (combination of Dutasteride and Silodosin). His ITP needs to be tackled and with all due precautions and keeping platelet concentrates on standby. He can undergo endoscopic surgery with due risks. Laser surgery - HoLEP will be better for him if available."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I am a 26 year old male. I am 5 feet and 9 inches tall and weigh 255 pounds. When I eat spicy food, I poop blood.

Frequently, performance anxiety could be a cause of premature ejaculation. In that case, you can take deep breathing for two minutes before sex. It will relax you enough. If you still feel anxious, you can take tablet Alprazolam 0.5mg half an hour before sexual activity. Remind yourself that you are having sex for mutual pleasure and relaxation. It is not an ordeal or duty where you are supposed to be the performer. There are many ways to treat premature ejaculation if it is not possibly due to anxiety. 1) The first technique is known as squeeze technique. In it, when you reach close to orgasm, you or your partner should squeeze on the ridge between the glans and the shaft of penis till the erection subsides. Then begin with your sexual activity once again. Repeat this a few times before you finally ejaculate. This will increase your time of ejaculation and also give you some voluntary control. 2) The second option is you can use Lignocaine spray (Shotmax spray). Spray once on the glans penis 15 minutes before sexual activity. It will reduce the extra sensitivity of the glans to normal level. You can also use 2% Lignox jelly (Lignocaine) instead of spray. 3) The third option is you can take tablet Dapoxetine 30 mg one hour before sexual activity. These techniques are sufficient to treat majority cases of premature ejaculation. 1. Anxiety. 2. Sensitive glans. Premature ejaculation. 1. Treat performance anxiety. 2. Squeeze technique. 3.

The next day when I woke up, my whole eyelid was swollen and hurt really bad. But the pain went down in three hours or so. I then realized that another boil was inside my eyelid. The boil burst by itself though and now I have three boils in my eyelid and the third one is in the inner corner of my eye. Is this serious?","Doctor":"Hi. Your history indicates recurrent inflammatory swellings of the glands of the eyelids in the form of hordeolum/stye (focal infection of the glands of the eyelid). Since these swellings are recurrent and multiple, you require evaluation to treat the underlying predisposing factors. However, no need to worry as this is not a serious condition. The treatment for hordeolum is the use of antibiotic eye drops or eye ointments and anti-inflammatory drugs. Applying hot compression provides symptomatic relief. The common problems that need to be ruled out are refractive errors, blepharitis (chronic inflammation of the eyelid) and systemic conditions like diabetes.

As per your complaints, it seems that you might have developed dependence on Benadryl. And it is quite possible that due to this dependence you might be having these symptoms. Benadryl is basically a Codeine-based cough syrup, which is an antitussive agent OTC (over the counter) drug used to suppress dry cough. Codeine is a psychotropic substance which belongs to opioid group which is known for its dependence producing properties. Hence, due to long-term self-medication codeine cough syrup produces physical dependence. In the absence of it, body will crave for it and will produce withdrawal symptoms in the form of body aches, restlessness, palpitations, sweating, rhinorrhea, lacrimation, agitation, perspiration, vomiting, shivering, yawning and rarely fever with visual disturbances. Hence, in your case there is a strong possibility that you might be having withdrawal symptoms. But to confirm that, you have to tell few more details, We can conclude whether it is of opioid dependence or not from the answers given by you to the above questions. If it comes out to be opioid dependence, then we have to start with substitute treatment for opioid in the form of either Buprenorphine or Naltrexone, along with symptomatic management.

The cause of recurrence may be Staphylococcus aureus, which is most commonly carried in the nostrils, armpits, between the legs and in the cleft between the buttocks. It may be transferred to other sites from the nostrils through the finger nails. General measures to avoid the recurrence are as follows. Regarding treatment, I suggest oral antibiotics like tablet Augmentin 625 mg (combination of Amoxicillin and Clavulanate potassium) if you are not allergic to penicillin group.

Random clicking and popping joints is a common occurrence and as long as there is no associated pain or swelling, there is nothing to worry about at a young age such as yours. Excessive stress and anxiety can make your muscles taut. This can happen during periods of depression too.

I have reviewed your history as well as the medication profile you just shared. (attachment removed to protect patient identity).  So the part of the problem is secondary to the medicine you are taking such as diarrhea which tends to occur secondary to Kremil-S since this medicine contains aluminum and magnesium both could cause diarrhea. I want you to stop it now. In addition, Senokot also causes diarrhea. I am afraid that your initial physician has given you both these medicines for constipation or for stomach pain? You should stop it as well until your diarrhea gets better. Omepron (Omeprazole) is a generic medication but there are many which are now available with good effect. I recommend you to switch to capsule Esomeprazole 40 mg. Take similarly as you were taking Omepron before breakfast in the morning. If this dose does not help increase the dose to twice daily before the meals.

It also mentioned that anterior placenta extending on the lower end. My gynecologist did not seem concerned at all and even never mentioned it. But, what does it mean? Is too early to judge? Or is there some precaution I must take? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hi. It is too early to judge about placental position. Secondly with growth of baby, placenta normally moves up. So, there is nothing of concern right now. Regarding precautions, low lying placenta which is also known as placenta previa may sometimes bleed (manifests as vaginal bleeding) with sexual intercourse. You have to keep this fact in mind if you experience bleeding. You can avoid intercourse to avoid bleeding, though it is not a must. Sexual abstinence not compulsory, as the placenta is just extending on the lower end and not of serious type which covers internal opening of the cervix.

My doctor tapered the tablet to Nexito Plus 5 mg three years back. My questions are: Is the relapse due to decreasing the dosage? Should I increase it again?","Doctor":"Hello. The dose of the particular drug depends upon many reasons. So, it is difficult to tell that this dose is effective or not for the particular person. Now coming back to your questions, first Nexito Plus (Escitalopram and Clonazepam) has only half of the dose compared to Nexito Forte (Escitalopram and Clonazepam). So, when tapering the dose, few persons may relapse. If you develop the symptoms of anxiety, you need to increase the dose again. And it is quite difficult to predict who is going to relapse. Secondly, as the Nexito Plus has a lower dose of the drug, it is quite prudent that it may not be effective in all persons. So, increasing the dose is a good option. Similarly, when one is tapering the dose, some symptoms may reoccur. Then one has to slow down the pace of tapering as to avoid the relapse. So, if you are stable on Nexito Plus, then no need to increase the dose, but if you have symptoms then you need to increase it. The dose is basically changed according to the response and side effects, one is tolerating. It is individually designed to meet the requirements of that particular person. Thanks and regards.

And if it is, why should not our surgeon correct it before the operation? I asked him about it, and he said it would be taken care of when she gets admitted. I wonder why?

So, why is this surgeon not bothered to correct the UTI pre-operatively?","Doctor":"Hello. RBC (red blood cells) in urine does not mean UTI (urinary tract infection). Pus cell in urine indicates UTI. Up to five pus cells per HPF are normal. 2 to 4 is in your case. So, it is not UTI. There are many causes of RBC in urine.

My teeth are yellow from childhood (from 10 years of age). A black layer is formed at the backside of teeth. When I see my teeth it seems very dirty and too much of creamy layer is formed on my teeth especially in lower canines and lower incisors. In the lower teeth, yellowness is 'V' shaped and in upper incisors the creamy layer is much lesser than the lower ones. The creamy layer gets removed by using my nails on that, but toothpowder is not able to remove that yellownees. I am feeling very sad while seeing my dirty teeth. My molar and premolar teeth have a black spot on them and people told me it is eaten by tooth worm. Is it true that tooth worm damages the teeth? When I contacted a local doctor he did scaling procedure. Just after scaling procedure, all the yellowness was clear (almost 80%) and black layer at the backside was also clear. I became very happy by seeing this. But about a month after scaling, my teeth again turned much yellowish and looks very bad and black layer at the backside of teeth also started appearing. Is scaling only a temporary process and is it complete wastage of money? For clean teeth, is there any permanent thing which will make our teeth very much white and glowing?","Doctor":"Hello. Yellowing of teeth is mainly due to one of the following or a combination of these: You have given an excellent description of the clinical condition of your oral cavity. From your history it is very clear that, the yellowness of your teeth is due to plaque and calculus deposits. Plaque as you have mentioned is yellowish and creamy. This gets partially removed with brushing. Calculi are hard deposits either yellowish, greenish or sometimes blackish in color. They are firmly attached to the teeth and do not go off with brushing or tooth powder. Even the abrasiveness of the tooth powder cannot remove the calculi. During childhood due to improper brushing there are chances of plaque and calculus formation over the teeth. Because children at this age tend to be playful and do not concentrate on oral hygiene. \\"Tooth worms\\" as people say are nothing but bacteria that affect the teeth. These bacteria act on the teeth and cause demineralization of the teeth and lead to tooth decay and cavities. The lower incisors and canines are more prone to plaque and calculus deposition (v shaped deposition in accordance with the tooth morphology) due to inability of us to reach the inner sides of these teeth while brushing. At this age of yours, these deposits may be due to: Dental scaling is the procedure that removes plaque and calculi. But it does not mean that these deposits will not come back again. Continuous oral hygiene maintenance after scaling is mandatory to prevent recurrence of plaque and calculi. Hence, scaling is not a wastage of money, it is an investment to prevent one's teeth and gums from infections and thereby increase the life of the teeth. So, a permanent solution for your problem is to follow these steps to maintain oral hygiene: And finally, pearl white color of the teeth indicate that they are unhealthy. Teeth which are slightly yellow, without any deposits on them are said to be healthy. Hope this answer helps you.

A herniated disc in the neck can cause three potential problems: As long as you do not have spinal cord dysfunction or significant weakness due to nerve compression, then you can try nonsurgical treatments like physical therapy, pain medication, or steroid injections. If you continue to have significant arm pain or neurological symptoms for more than 6 weeks or develop weakness then you may need surgery.

I also have an upper molar that is broken decayed and has been like this for years. The wisdom tooth oozes green pus if you apply pressure with a cotton swab. The decayed tooth is mildly painful. I saw my dentist a few days ago, who did not seem overly concerned. She slightly cleaned the gums around the wisdom tooth and prescribed me Cephalexin and sent me on my way.

Mostly when I eat rice, and spicy food my cough starts. I have called a gynecologist and she told me to have Adovas after lunch and Duvent (Rupatadine 10 mg) after dinner for seven days. After seven days, I called her and told her that I feel a little better but not stopped coughing and she advise me to take Adovas only three times a day. I did and it did not help me at all. I called her again and she advises Montelukast 10 mg after dinner and its also not working. It has been four days since I took Montelukast and I feel like I need to deep breath when I take it.

As far as small cysts are concerned they are unmatured eggs which failed to induce menstrual cycle previously, as a result, they got collected in the ovary and they will remain in the ovary. Now, you have got your periods you can start trying for conception. But I advise you to do it under the supervision of a nearby gynecologist because egg size is important while conception and that you can know by ovulation study.

Can I try naturally and see if my body will ovulate on own or should I continue with the Clomid?","Doctor":"Hello. Just by using Clomid (Clomifene) or Letrozole, you may not have your periods. Did you have any significant bleeding post delivery? Your weight looks fine. No periods for five years is too long, and present hormone levels will be unknown. I suggest you have any of the birth control pills of 21 twice a day for 10 days. Throw away the 21st pill. No matter what the cause is, you will have periods within 7 to 10 days of the last medicine. On day three or four of your periods have serum FSH (follicle stimulating hormone), LH (luteinizing hormone) and AMH (anti-Mullerian hormone). This will give you an idea of follicle reserve and also if any central cause present. If both these are normal, you can start Clomid or Letrozole from day three or four and will have a much better result.

The window period of the Ag/Ab test varies from 18 to 45 days. Therefore a negative test at six weeks (42 days) would be considered conclusive in 98-99 % individuals.

I welcome you to icliniq. First of all try to reduce your weight. At most times, it is the obesity which has been causing problems. The bleeding while passing stools can be secondary to anal fissure, hemorrhoids, rectal ulcer due to difficult defecation.

How painful it is while passing stools? and does it causes pain or burning even after 1 hour of opening your bowel? and Do you have constipation? No. of stools in a week? If you could answer me for above question, I would be in better position to tell you what it is exactly. Considering a possibility of anal fissure, I recommend you to apply Diltiazem gel 2 % over the bottom with a finger 3 times daily, and start taking ispagol husk 2 table spoon full in glass of water daily irrespective of constipation or not.

I understand that you are concerned, but if the mucosal surface were not in contact and there were no open wounds in contact, then it is not possible to acquire STDs (sexually transmitted disease) like HIV, syphilis, herpes, etc. But the STDs like genital warts, or genital molluscum does not need to have mucosal contact as mere contact of the lesions on genital skin can lead to spreading of these STDs.

My left tube is clear HSG test was done. Kindly explain to me.","Doctor":"Hello. No matter which side the ovulation occurs, the egg will fall into the peritoneal cavity and moves into the available open tube through which it enters the uterus. Since you had one ectopic pregnancy, you have a higher chance of repeat tubal pregnancy. But since HSG (hysterosalpingography) shows a patent tube, you also have a high chance of normal uterine pregnancy.

I recently had my yearly eye check-up, and my doctor told me that my eye pressure is slightly above average. I know that having a high eye pressure can cause glaucoma, and it leads to permanent blindness. I do not have any pain in the eye, and also there is no family history of glaucoma. So my question is, how do I know if I have glaucoma, and what are the chances of actually getting diagnosed with glaucoma?Is there any home treatments I can do to reduce my chances of getting glaucoma? Any eye drops I can use or any pills or vitamins I can take? My doctor said that just because my eye pressure is slightly above average, it does not mean I have glaucoma. My doctor also said there is nothing to worry about, but I need a second opinion.","Doctor":"Hello. Over the years, glaucoma definition has changed. Glaucoma is damage to the optic nerve with visual field defects, and intraocular pressure (IOP) is one of the risk factors. Only with high IOP, we cannot label that someone has glaucoma. Because some people have IOP more elevated than normal but still that is not damaging (called ocular hypertension), and some people have normal IOP, and that is damaging for them, so that is labeled as normal tension glaucoma. So IOP only is not determining factor to label glaucoma other important factors are there. Glaucoma evaluation needs some tests like visual fields and OCT (optical coherence tomography) and optic disc. After seeing all test, diagnosis of glaucoma is labeled. Complete eye exam and analyses are needed for diagnosing. Pain is a feature of one type of glaucoma that is angle closure, and most of the patients of glaucoma would never have pain and will be diagnosed accidentally or through routine eye exam or with decreased vision. No medication is needed until the diagnosis of glaucoma is made. Risk of glaucoma is still there even if family history is negative. Especially after 40 years of age, people having glasses (myopes or hypermetropia) are at risk. So I would advise you not to worry and let your doctor decide. If he or she thinks you need some tests, they will advise you and then determine whether you have glaucoma or not. Otherwise, relax and enjoy.

Hymen will not be hard, and your partner needs to understand your vagina, proper foreplay will dilate the vaginal region for easy access. Ask your partner to masturbate for you and increase foreplay. The hymen does not generally break in the first penetrative sex. If your pain persists, it can be due to injury, wait for a week for the hymen to heal. If your pain persists, you can use a painkiller. Increase the foreplay time or masturbation will lubricate the vagina for less painful sex. Use K-Y gel (water based lunbricant), or painkillers if you have any doubts regarding masturbation and foreplay.

Investigations pointed to high autoimmune antibodies and high NK cells. With medication, I conceived naturally and had a successful pregnancy. I am now pregnant again (unplanned) and am 7 weeks + 3. I had some spotting and cramping three days ago. The spotting was light and stopped within a few hours. The cramping continued for another day. Blood hCG levels are rising very well and are currently over 83,000. A transvaginal scan yesterday showed the heartbeat and we were told all is well. Today, I had some light spotting (dark brown) and discomfort and passed a brown clot.

I am concerned anyway and any advice would be greatly appreciated. Current medications: Eltoxin, Prednisolone 5 mcg, Clexane. Sarting Intralipids next week to target NK cells.","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing?  I understand your concern. From your history, I do not see any reason for you to worry. This spotting could be from mild erosion on surface of the cervix, which may bleed spontaneously or during sex or due to scan probe. In your history as you have not mentioned pain, I can say for sure that there is no intrauterine blood. Scan also did not pick any hemorrhages (attachment removed to protect patient identity).

Thank you.","Doctor":"Hi. I went through all your reports (attachments removed to protect patient identity). Only few abnormalities noted. Raised insulin levels indicate that your body is becoming resistant to Insulin. It means that you are at risk of becoming diabetic in near future. The solution for raised insulin level is daily aerobic exercise like brisk walking, jogging, running, cycling or swimming for at least 30 minutes every day. Elevated total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol are seen. Since the elevation is not much, also you are young (in report it was mentioned as 32 years) there is no need to start medication at present. Eat low calorie low cholesterol diet - avoid sweets, carbonated beverages, non-vegetarian food, junk food, cheese, butter and ghee. Eat more of fruits, vegetables and drink plenty of water. And do exercise as advised above. Elevated platelet count with slight reduction in mean corpuscular hemoglobin (MCH) and mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (MCHC) is probably due to iron deficiency. For this the solution is eat iron-rich foods like jaggery, green leafy vegetables, peanuts and dates."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I have had ED for several years now.

Hydrochlorothiazide need to be replaced with a different drug or removed. You are on three antihypertensives Lisinopril, HCTZ, and Amlodipine. Is your hypertension that severe? Testosterone implant may improve your libido but may not benefit ED (erectile dysfunction) always unless there is a gross hormonal dysfunction. SSRI group of medicines are prescribed to delay ejaculation. I do not know why were you prescribed one. That is the culprit which has stopped your ejaculation totally. Better to discontinue it. Instead of Sildenafil for erection, you can try tablet Tadalafil 10 mg (Cialis) after consulting your andrologist. The erectile effects of Sildenafil are short lasting whereas Tadalafil has prolonged effects and one pill on Friday will make you have a wholesome weekend. It may even stop the need to have intracavernosal injections. One investigation which I would suggest you is a penile doppler which gives an idea of blood flow to the penis. GAINSWave is an addon to cure you fast. Penile doppler study. ED."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor,I am just wondering what is abutting and abutment of the nerve root means in a back issue. Please explain.

Age 9 years, female. Treatment IVMP for five days. Please suggest the best possible treatment and please explain about the condition.","Doctor":"Hello. MOG-antibodies are common in children with acute demyelinating syndromes (like optic neuritis in your case) with both monophasic and relapsing disease courses. MOG is myelin oligodendrocytes glycoprotein normally present on oligodendrocytes of brain, spinal cord and optic nerve myelinated neurons. Many time during viral infection or due to some unknown reason, bodies immune cells falsely perceive it as a foreign particles and attack on it and it will damage the myelin sheeth. Mostly affects vision of eyes, spinal cord function and brain. Diagnosis is made by history and examinations, MRI brain and spine, CSF, NMO, MOG antibodies. Treatment of patients with MOG-Ab-associated demyelination includes management of acute relapses and chronic immunotherapy for those with relapsing disease. Acute phase treatment: Best possible treatment in your case is IV Steroid for five days, already given. But in case severe disease, IV immunoglobulin or plasma exchange for five days, both will reinstall immunity but not indicated in your case as she is improving with steroids. Maintenance with tablet Prednisolone 1 mg/kg/day for four to six weeks, then will slowly taper down and stop.

After the period I did an hCG test and it was positive. 37 days after abortion my hCG level is 18.21. After three days, the test showed 17.56. I also did an ultrasound and the doctor said I have 3 mm endometrial thickness on one spot. He prescribed me Duphaston to take from day 15th day to 25th day of my cycle. I am scared to take it and also I am scared that maybe I have some retained products but the doctor said I am fine. What should I do? Is it safe to take Duphaston in my condition?","Doctor":"Hello. First of all, there is no harm in taking Duphaston in your condition. It is just a progesterone hormonal analog, the same hormone is secreted from the ovaries once the egg is released after ovulation. So there is nothing to worry about taking it. I would like to know what was the indication for checking beta hCG (human chorionic gonadotropin) value at 37th-day post-abortion, when everything was fine, you even got your periods pretty much on time? Regarding your beta hCG value, I would like to tell you that beta hCG may be detected in maternal blood up to 4-6 weeks post first-trimester miscarriage or medical abortion. Did you had a missed miscarriage or was it an unwanted pregnancy that was terminated medically, and at how many weeks of gestation? This is important because sometimes missed miscarriage may harbor partial molar pregnancy which goes unnoticed, as biopsy or histopathological examination is not done for such cases. But yes, any persistence beyond 6 weeks of abortions should be monitored carefully as these may be a hint of development of gestational trophoblastic neoplasia (GTN). As your scan is normal, and also endometrial thickness of 3 mm is also a normal finding, so there is no chance of having any retained products. It would be helpful if you could share the ultrasound reports (pre and post-abortion), and the dates of the events along with the date of doing beta hCG levels to have a better idea of your situation. I would advise you to recheck your beta hCG value again after a week. Please revert back to me with the necessary details I requested you, so that I can guide you further.

I grew up in a household where the food we bought was either on sale or a big deal, despite having money now, when someone eats food I was looking forward to the fact that I get inexplicably angry. My step sister steals my clothing and it makes me have nightmares about hurting her. Something else concerning is when my best friend ignores me for other people it hurts me a lot as I place so much value in everything. I have seen a psychiatrist regularly but this is a question I have never had answered. Is there a way to trace this behavior to my upbringing or prevent it from affecting my life? I am currently prescribed Zoloft and Adderall.","Doctor":"Hello.  When someone eats food and you get angry, this could be due to part of anxiety. A lot of individuals with anxiety have such kind of symptoms. This is not a thing to get worried. You are on Zoloft which is an anti-anxiety drug and this should help you with time.   When someone steals your clothes and you get angry then this is not an abnormal behaviour. I do not see any abnormality in this. Most of individuals have such kind of behaviour. Getting hurt on behaviour of your friend also has nothing related to your upbringing. Sometimes when we expect from an individual to whom we are close and when he or she ignores us, then it is normal to get hurt. But, if this is prolonged and you feel depressed because of this, then this might be due to some personality issue. You are 19 and at this age, such kind of behaviour is normal. With time you will see improvement in yourself."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, Please say about the specific ways to reduce the IBS symptoms.","Doctor":"Hi. Irritable bowel syndrome has these symptoms such as decreased sleep at night, depression, musculoskeletal pain or fibromyalgia, decreased sexual performance, and inadequate attention. IBS can be diarrhea-predominant or constipation predominant or mixed. In the case of diarrhea-predominant IBS, it is better to avoid eating vegetables, flour containing products and other foods containing FODMAP (Fermented foods containing oligosaccharides, monosaccharides, and polyols). It is helpful for some patients. After having repeated counseling, they need pharmacotherapy. I advise taking Chlordiazepoxide with Clidinium bromide and a probiotic combination trial. It helps for some persons. In the case of constipation-predominant IBS, I advise stool bulking agents like psyllium husk or lactulose to the patient. For the depression and musculoskeletal pain, I usually prescribe Duloxetine which works better than SSRI (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors). But in cases when the musculoskeletal pain is not severe, I advise SSRI. Hyperacidity is a common problem seen in these type of patients. Treat with a short course of PPI (proton pump inhibitors) first and then downgrade to Ranitidine after the symptoms get controlled. In some patients, counseling plays an essential role in the treatment of IBS."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I had myself tested because I have had a blood transfusion before six years and visit many hospitals for my job. I have no symptoms. I just went to the laboratory and did not understand my results.

But I suffer from the side effects of these medications. My biggest complaints were increased anxiety, and panic attacks, along with weight gain (50 pounds), and tachycardia that kept me up at night and freaked me out. So my family doctor sent me to a psychiatrist, and he prescribed Imipramine. I had never heard of this, so I searched, and it seems like weight gain and tachycardia (my two most significant concerns with medications) are common side effects for this medication. I am not sure why he prescribed this one to me, but I wanted to get a second opinion to see if this is a good idea since I already have tachycardia and do not wish to gain more weight. I am scared even to try this medicine because I do not want to go into some weird heart rhythm.","Doctor":"Hello. I can understand your problem. Imipramine is a tricyclic antidepressant drug, and yes the drug is known to result in side effects like weight gain. But this depends upon the dose, the duration of treatment, patient factors, etc. Lexapro (Escitalopram), Wellbutrin (Bupropion), Effexor (Venlafaxine), Prozac (Fluoxetine), etc., are serotonergic drugs and it is common with these drugs to see increased anxiety for first few days of starting the drugs. In most cases, this rebound increase in anxiety goes by own. So my advice is to continue the drugs even if you see worsening of symptoms. In most cases, after a week of starting the drugs symptoms remit. Imipramine is also the right choice, and the drug causes sedation so you should take medicine in the evening after dinner and should start with low doses. When the drug is started in low doses, then you will not face any rebound increase in anxiety. Kindly get ECG done before starting the medication."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, My fiance fingered me and I am not sure whether he had masturbated before fingering.

Small vessels must have been punctured (quite normal) which lead to extravasation of blood hence the bruise. It will take a few more days, but both the bruise and the bump should go away. Do apply ice packs there you will get you the necessary relief. Ganglion cysts are notorious for recurrence but highly unlikely to be associated or related to the injection. If you can send me a clinical picture that would be better. Splint is fine but you do need to mobilize your wrist for a very long time otherwise you might end up having stiff wrist (2-3 weeks should not cause any stiffness). Understanding tendinitis is important you need a very specific rehab protocol and few medications and you should feel much better in few weeks time. Did you get your vitamin D levels tested? Kindly revert with the info."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, my son is 19 months old .... He is grinding teeth most of the time ...

During teenage, it is very common to get acne, especially on cheeks and forehead due to several reasons (primarily because of hormonal changes in puberty).

Your symptoms do not seem to be due to a heart problem. Tingling sensations, irritation, etc., are not caused by the heart. Your symptoms more or less seem to be due to some nerve irritation which may be localized or generalized. I advise you to consult a neurologist for proper evaluation of symptoms. Sometimes nerves got entrapped between bones in the neck or vertebral column that causes pain, tingling, numbness in fingers, arms and hands. If you are a pure vegetarian, there may be vitamin B12 deficiency, which can cause such symptoms. Apart from these, there may be a problem in the peripheral and central nervous system.

I looked up my symptoms and suspected it might be gum disease because I have always had poor dental hygiene and never flossed. Since then I started brushing, flossing, and using a natural mouthwash three times a day, then I went to the dentist and asked about my concerns. The dentist told me that I did not have gum disease and had nothing to be concerned about and the loose bottom teeth were most likely from grinding. I want to believe him but I also want to be sure he is correct. My gums are mostly pink close to the teeth but farther down they are very red and seem decayed.","Doctor":"Hi. Let me tell you something. Even I have undergone this situation (personally). There are several types of periodontal conditions, out of which, this is called trauma from occlusion due to bruxism, clenching. Your teeth may loose its normal curves or contour and may even get loose. Primary line of treatment involves splint or night guard, along with minor procedures. You can share a picture by following up and attaching a file. I would be glad to assist you. Many a times, such mobility turns out to be more physiological than pathological (as it turned out for me)."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, When I was younger, I had a bottle rocket blow up in my eye. It left a scar in front of my pupil, so I am no longer able to see out of the eye, and am considered legally blind. My pupil stays dilated all the time, and where it is not able to focus on anything, it wonders to the right. I was wondering if there is any new surgery, that could possibly help.","Doctor":"Hello. Thankfully only one eye was affected and I hope your other eye is intact and fully functional. Unfortunately, a dilated pupil that does not react to light in the affected eye means that it is no longer transmitting information to the brain and therefore is considered non functional. In most cases those changes are irreversible and the eye is no longer considered a functioning organ. But, hope dies last, and to cheer you up a bit, there are many ongoing clinical researches on the restoration of vision in blind eyes and mainly involve implanting a chip in the retina and connecting it to the brain and although the results are not what a patient would expect, nonetheless it helps the eye detect objects on a very primitive level. As I said earlier, thank God that only one eye was affected and you should take care of it by undergoing a yearly comprehensive eye exam. I wish you best of luck."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, My mother’s age is 80+ and she had heart attack four times. Two attacks in quick succession a year back and two attacks quick in last one month. Her heart pumping capacity is about 35 % with kidney creatinine 3.4 mg/dl. But it is decreasing now. She never had diabetes. But always when admitted to hospital for heart attack treatment, her sugar level increased a bit and hospital always started giving her Insulin. Last one and half year her cardiologist never advised her to go under any aggressive treatment like doing angiogram and then further treatment like angioplasty and ect. If we go for angiogram followed by further treatment like angioplasty and ring fixing. Will it be safe for her? Will she be able to survive? Traditional angiogram or CT angiogram and then angioplasty or ring.","Doctor":"Hi.  Although bypass or angioplasty can be done in old age, if the health of patient is promising, but if other health issues are present then it becomes a high risk case. As your mother's kidney function is poor, it becomes very risky to have an angiogram done because even non-ionic contrast medium is detrimental for the kidneys. One possibility is that have her 1 or 2 sessions of dialysis done first, then go for angiography and angioplasty and again have one or more sessions of dialysis in close liaison with good nephrologist. If this is done safely, then next risk is of bleeding. After angioplasty, blood thinning medicines are given for long time, this may cause bleeding problem in old age. Regarding bypass, it is a major surgery and needs general anesthesia, although not impossible in old age but, it depends upon overall health and organ functions of body. Cardiac anesthetist will fully evaluate her before bypass. Third option is to keep her on medicines only without going for any intervention. In my opinion, consult a nephrologist that is there any chance of recovery of kidney function, if no then periprocedural dialysis can be considered."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I have very sore area behind the last tooth on my upper right side of my mouth.

There are three possibilities about this soreness, either there is some problem with the tooth, may be it is fractured. Secondly, possibility is that you may have got trauma due to biting or food like fish sting stuck there. Third possibility is that due to trauma from biting you may have developed an ulcer.  Now if your tooth is carious, fractured, then you may require antibiotics or it may require to be restored or extracted.

You have probably healed your TB (tuberculosis) and there is nothing to worry right now.  Pleural thickening has happened as a result of the effusion you had. It is a way of healing which the body does when effusion happens. It will not get worse with age and you will not get TB again. There are no higher chances of cancer also related to that. A large number of people suffer from this and it does not affect life in any way. Thickening usually does not get reversed. It will remain there.

He then did a test where I would touch my nose then his finger, I could do it on my right side, but missed every time on the left.

As far as small cysts are concerned they are unmatured eggs which failed to induce menstrual cycle previously, as a result, they got collected in the ovary and they will remain in the ovary. Now, you have got your periods you can start trying for conception. But I advise you to do it under the supervision of a nearby gynecologist because egg size is important while conception and that you can know by ovulation study.

Chickenpox and shingles are caused due to the same virus. Chickenpox occurs first and the virus stays dormant in the dorsal ganglia of the spinal nerves. After years or when immunity decreases, the person gets an attack of shingles. Most people get shingles only once, but few can get 2 to 3 times.

My blood pressure, sugar levels, and cholesterol are in exceptional range. I have never been on any prescription pills. All of my routines have been normal and regular and I am currently working on continuing to lose weight by adjusting the intake of calories, but still eating the full range of foods. It has been a safe and gradual process and I am down by 35 lbs over the past two years. I do not exercise now, but I stretch every morning for about 20 to 30 minutes. For the last week, I have experienced pangs of intermittent pain in my lower right side. I would approximate the feeling to be about 2 inches inside my side and just about at the lateral side of my body, perhaps a bit more towards the back. The pain is not acute, nor persistent, and it seems more present once I wake up. It does not bother me at all during the night. My own research does not seem to align with appendicitis or something abdominal, and I am beginning to believe it is a temporary muscle spasm of sorts, primarily due to a lousy work chair which has been a recent change. Again, all bodily functions are normal and I have not had headaches or fever or pain of any kind elsewhere. It is localized and randomly repeats only in the lower right, internal area I have described. I would like to know what is on the field of considerations, serious to not, so I can assess the next steps.","Doctor":"Hello. Good luck.

I did not get my period on the actual date. May I consider the spotting as my periods? But it was not the usual amount of bleeding as I have in my period. I only used a liner with it and not may napkin pad.","Doctor":"Hello. Your spotting for the three days cannot be considered as the menstrual period. The usual amount should at least be at 80 ml per cycle, and that would approximate at least 10 moderately soaked pads. Some possible causes would be a hormonal disturbance, and this could vary as far as pregnancy, and hormonal imbalance is secondary to stress, weight loss, current illness, etc. I would suggest you to have a pregnancy test first if it is negative, then you may opt to observe until the second week of next month. If there is no period still, you need to consult your gynecologist to help you with the diagnostics such as transvaginal ultrasound and if no other causes, she may prescribe you with pills to regulate your period back.

It spontaneously resolves when she places her feet at least two pillows higher than her body or only by little elevation. In your case, we must rule out the possibility of cellulitis. Its is a condition such as how you described, swollen feet or ankle, usually pinkish or erythematous and tender to touch, sometimes warm to touch. Your symptoms are not the usual finding on a pregnant woman and must be seen immediately at the emergency room to give you first aid of a possibility of infection. It is also best that you have your blood pressure taken since the pregnant patient with edema usually has elevated blood pressure."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am a diabetic taking Glimepiride and Metformin.

Do you have other complaints in addition to burning sensation like fever with or without chills, abdomen pain, vomitings, and blood in urine? The rise in creatinine in your case can be due to a pre-existing renal disease due to hypertension, or the current urinary tract infection may also cause this. I advise you to get, 1) Complete urine examination for any urinary tract infection. 2) Urine culture and sensitivity to identify the specific organism causing infection and antibiotic sensitivity. 3) Ultrasound abdomen to look for any urine stones still present. 4) Complete renal function test. 5) Complete blood count.

A slight variation in fasting and PP (postprandial) glucose levels can occur. It is not unusual. Please tell me with the value 61 with food, did you have any symptoms of hypoglycemia? This looks like reactive hypoglycemia, which tends to happen in persons with excess weight plus when one takes too much of sugary foods or drinks like aerated drinks, juices, etc. With a BMI (body mass index) of 33.57 you are already close to grade 2 obesity. Your ideal body weight should be 65 kgs, which means there is an excess of almost 30 kgs. This is one of the reasons for reactive hypoglycemia. It is also an indicator of future development of diabetes. So avoid sugary foods, juices, and sweets. Take a healthy diet, plus make serious efforts to reduce weight.
