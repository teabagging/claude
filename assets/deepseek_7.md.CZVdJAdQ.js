He is always keeping his leg in folded position. His same leg was used to give him some antibiotics when he was sick using the canula ( IV set ) in his feet . Is that the reason . His right knee looks bigger then his left knee . please advise .","Doctor":"Hi,When was the canula removed (if it was more than 1 week before, need not worry about)? An IV canula in feet is very unlikely to cause swelling at knee. If at all it was related to canula, swelling will first appear around feet and then climb up. Here we have to rule out an important condition called septic arthritis of knee (bacterial infection of the knee joint fluid)- this an emergency needing immediate workup and treatment to avoid permanent joint damage. So please take him to an orthopedist without delay. You may be asked for few blood tests and an X-ray. Meanwhile, give him paracetamol to relieve pain.Hope I have answered your question.

It is totally curable if we complete the antibiotic course (5-7 days). If his symptoms are not coming down by 3rd day, please get back to your doctor as we will need to change the antibiotic.Please note, girls are at higher risk after 1year of age- before that, both are at equal risk, and UTI can happen in both sexes at all ages. For my patients, when they get UTI before 5 years of age, I used to get an ultrasound abdomen to see for any anomalies of urinary tract, which is very rare but better to do as per the standard protocol- you can discuss this with your doctor.Hope I have answered your question.

I have been giving her Tonoferon since last 10 days but i havent seen any change in her weight also her appetite has not increased . Please suggest if Tonoferon is ok or not?","Doctor":"Hi,I am not sure whether your doctor has noticed anything abnormal (like pallor indicating anaemia) apart from weight. In my opinion, 5.9kg at 4 months is quite good (>90% of expected weight at this age). We call it under weight when weight is below 80-85% of expected, although we need to consider birth weight also.Tonoferon contains iron supplements, used to prevent and treat iron deficiency anaemia(anaemia can cause poor appetite and inadequate weight gain). If I feel my patients are anaemic, I used to order for a blood count and peripheral smear, to see haemoglobin level before starting iron supplements. You can discuss with your doctor.For your baby, present weight is well and fine- just give him frequent breast feeds. We can monitor weight gain in coming months- usually they gain around 400g / month.Hope I have answered your question. Let me know if I can assist you further.

With the history you have given, it seems that you have got an intestinal infection possibly some kind of food poisoning. This is why you have got diarrhoea, nausea, and pain in the abdomen. You have to take appropriate antibiotics on consultation with your family physician.Another cause for the pain in the abdomen could be due some infection of the testis in yous sack which causes some localised pain as per your history. The bunch of veins what you are feeling is a condition known as Varicocele of the testicular veins, which may cause heaviness in your sacks. I am not sure if you have already completed your family or not. Vacocele is sometimes incorporated as one of the causative factors for sterility.

Please type your query here...hi my son whos is exactly 2 months old right now is suffering from bad cough. After trying some medication which have not resulted in any relief, i am now told to take him for nebulization. how does this help","Doctor":"Hi,Cough may be caused by many reasons - secretions / sputum in airways, wheezing / obstruction of airway or airway irritation as in flu- the cause can be found out after directly examining him. If there is sputum in chest, antibiotics will help. If it is caused by wheezing or airway obstruction, nebulization will help. Nebulization causes relaxation of constricted airways, relieving cough.In flu and viral infections, it may take 5-7 days for cough to disappear.

The next day he seemed fine, so I figured he was just tired. Then a week later, He developed a fever that reached abot 101 degrees (axillary). He also had what appeared to be a diaper rash and was irritable and tired for a couple of days. We gave him tylenol, treated the diaper rash and let him rest and this seemed to resolve within 48 hours. Then five days later, we noticed what appeared to be hives all over his body and face. So, we took him to a doctor and they diagnosed him with strep throat. We started antibiotics that night (Thursday). On Saturday morning, my husband said that he felt warm to the touch, but never took his temp. He just gave him Tylenol and the antibiotic. He also noticed that his gait seemed a little funny and he was crying and irritable when he woke up from his nap. This morning, Sunday, I called the doctor s office because I was concerned about rheumatic fever or some other complication of strep or something being missed altogether. The doctor finally called back this evening and stated that he was doubtful that it could be rheumatic fever but agreed to see him again tomorrow. The latest development this evening is that my son does not want to bear weight on his legs. He will not come to me when called and he only wants to sit, crawl, or be carried. When I tried to stand him up, he cried. Otherwise, his temperament is normal, he s eating and drinking and in good spirits. Do you have any ideas?

For such cases, after confirming the diagnosis by direct inspection (sometimes needing a KOH smear examination). I used to give topical anti fungal creams like clotimazole fore 2 weeks.

Has been prescribed paracetamol and and antibiotic. However, the fever persists at around 101 to 102 levels. Also she is complaining of mild stomach ache and has diarrhea. Is there a reason to worry, or should I wait for 24 hrs more.","Doctor":"Hi,I guess the diarrhea came after starting antibiotics. Usually, it will take 48-72 hours for fever to come down after starting antibiotic. If he is not very tired and taking diet as usual, need not worry- just wait for 2-3 days. Meanwhile, give him plenty of oral fluids (ORS best) and a soft diet. The diarrhea is probably related to antibiotic. It is because of alteration in our normal gut flora- will subside once the treatment is completed.

Your doctor had given you for 15 days, may be because of inadequate response initially. Since it recurred shortly after completion of treatment, the bacteria was likely resistant to the given antibiotic(a common situation). In my patients, before starting antibiotic I used to send urine culture to find out the exact organism and the drug active against that, the report will be available by 3rd or 4th day so that we can give the correct antibiotic.Here, you have not mentioned about culture report.

But those having frequent or sever symptoms will definitely benefit from inhalers.I will explain why. When child develop asthma, airway constrict and when we give nebulization, it relaxes back. But when he gets repeated episodes, slowly the relax-ability decreases and finally a stage will reach, where we wont get adequate symptom relief even after nebulization. It is very important to regularly administer inhalers to indicated cases to prevent this irreversible damage.You need no worry much about side effects- compared to repeated courses of oral drugs during each episodes, regular inhalers are much safe- they are given at very low doses and no much systemic side effects compared to oral medications.

Her discomfort/pain ranges from a feeling of fullness which includes feeling like she has alot of trapped air or gas, to more of a sharp, stabbing pain. She tends to get this feeling more after she eats. She also has been having a tendency to emit a sound that is as best I can describe as a loud and forceful \\"hiccupy\\" belch. I have asked her about the appearance of her stools and she says they seem normal in consistency and color. She has been to her doctor and he put her on a generic prescription of Prevacid as he thinks it may be some sort of reflux condition and she has been taking it for about 3 weeks with no noticeable improvement. Her doctor also ordered an abdominal ultrasound and the results came back normal with the exception of a polyp on her gall bladder which the doctor's office said was nothing to worry about and would not be contributing to the symptoms she's experiencing anyway. I should mention also that although she has not had any vomiting, she often feels queasy (especially in the morning) and her appetiite has diminished somewhat. Our next step is to have her get an upper GI to determine what is going on. Could you please give me your professional input as to what you think her symptoms are pointing to?","Doctor":"Hello ronniekay,When the complaints are in the abdomen, you think that the problem is in the organ level. Very often it need not be the case. You have not mentioned in the long letter, since how long your daughter is having pain in the abdomen. This is an important missing link to connect her present symptoms to any possible cause.After all possible investigations also, if you find that nothing is evident to produce this pain, then also such pains and belching are possible. Since she is a very young girl, a lot of sensitivities are possible both in the mental and physical levels. In my practice a number of children have come with similar abdominal problems after being ridiculed publicly in the school by teachers, after failing in exams which they thought would win, after losing a close friend either by transfer or death and after innumerable emotional conflicts of similar nature. You have not given the details about her mental make up, her peculiarities in the mental level, her reactions to her life situations etc. which are essential to analyse her problems. In Psychology such abdominal complaints occur if she has a problem in the mental level that she cannot 'digest'. You have to probe whether she was abused by somebody immediately before the onset of her problems.Therefore my advise is to take her to an expert Homoeopath who will take her case in detail, analyse her symptoms in the light of her mental and physical make up and find for her the genetic constitutional remedy which will not only remove her present symptoms but also will keep her free from such sufferings in similar circumstances in future. Any amount of investigations need not always give any evidence for the pain. Please do not give her any more chemical drugs to relieve the symptoms of pain, belching etc. without understanding the totality of her problems.

I would like to know what it could be and if i should take him to the er.","Doctor":"Hi,I could not get whether bumps on lips appeared along with fever or it was already there even before. Here I assume the later situation. Fever and rash is probably from a viral fever. The rash may be somewhat itchy, making him uncomfortable. Just give him paracetamol 3-4 times a day and calamine lotion for application over rash if itchy.If itching is disturbing, I used to prescribe anti0histamine like hydroxyzine to my patients. White bump on lips are usually mucus retention cysts - may disappear its own after sometime. If concerning, can be removed under local anaesthesia (drugs wont help much).

This is called Proctalgia fugax. This is a recurrent pain in the rectal area which may also radiate to other perineal part. The pain could be so excruciating that the person can faint at times. It is advisable to lie down during the attack, and to massage the area in front of the rectum at the initial period of pain. You can also take some anti anxiety drugs if advised by your doctor. Sitz bath ( siting on a tub with warm water) also helps sometimes.However, if the symptoms increase and persist, you should get reviewed by your doctor to some organic causes of such pain, such as, prolapsed hemorrhoids, irritable bowel syndrome, or any infiltrating growth in the rectal area.Wishing you an early recovery."},{"Patient":"Hi, may I answer your health queries right now ?

If the rash appeared all of a sudden , with spreading from one site to other parts and associated with raised patches as in give, this could be due to allergy toward some insect bite also.

My daughter is 19 weeks old and from Sunday night (just gone) has had more frequent bowel movements than normal. Normal for my daughter is one movement a day/every other day.

However, earlier I noticed that the soft spot on her head is a little sunken. I had also administered saline drops in her nose whilst she was lying down as she has a bit of a cold and is quite nasely - this promptly made her choke a little and she vomited - in my opinion quite a lot. She has always been a fussy/sporadic eater (formula fed) but it seems within the last week she has a bowel movement after every feed (especially today).

So far today she has had 21 fl oz of milk (albeit some of that was brought up earlier.

All was going fine and he loved his solids and milk and has slept through the night for the last few months. Last friday he started to refuse his solid and milk, and vomited after a solid feed. I took hime to a doctor who said he had an ear infection and gave him pencillen to take 3 times a day. We are also giving him calpol. I took him back to the doctors on tuesday as he is still refusing all solids he won t let anything in his mouth and most bottles. They checked his throat which was fine and his ears were still red.

You can achieve this by pinching the kid so that it, the pinching will cause the baby to cry and to cry the baby has to take a breath first and so the breath holding spell will be broken. But to prevent the spell, you need to be clear in not bending to all the whims and fancies of the kid because, kids usually develop this sort of tendency when they are adamant and the adults start accepting their requests when they cry inconsolably.

He is just 4 and half years old and we are too much worry about him. We already have been consulted with some neuro physician doctors in Pakistan but they said that a big part of his brain has been damaged and it can’t be recover after seeing MRI report which I’ve been uploaded here: WWW.WWWW.WW Some doctors say it is happened because of his late cry during his birth (he cried approx. 8 to 10 mins late after delivery) and then after 20 days of his birth he got meningitis issue and he stayed in hospital for few months but after this he had been recovered very well, he talked well, he walked well even he was a very clever and sharp baby than others but since 5 months before he again got attack and doctors say now that he has degenerative brain disease. Doctors also have been taken few other tests like EEG, Anti Measels antibody CSF, Blood, Liver function etc etc and I’ve upload images of those tests here: 1.      2.      3.                in doctors opinion there is no such medicine for degenerative brain disease but as he is getting fits (like when we just got a shock sometime and we scared) and he continuously getting fits in each 2,3 seconds. So neuro physician doctor has recommended some medicine for him to control his fits i.e. 1.     Apival Syrup. 2.     Frizium Tab. 3.     Lerace Syrup 4.     Debritone Syrup 5.     Zinkate Syrup In doctor’s opinion this medicine is as good as maximum to control his fits (I don’t know how to spell it but I have explained term fits above). 1.     So my question is that there is no proper treatment of degenerative brain disease in this latest time of technology? 2.     His situation is going bad to worse day by day with using these medicines which about doctors say this is as good as max so I just think sometime that may be doctors just couldn’t have figured out the actual issue of his disease because otherwise his situation should be little positive with using these medicines? 3.     So, after watching out his medical case history is there any place in the world who could deal this dangerous disease? He can’t speak now, can’t walk now, can’t eat now therefore he is taking all his feeds with NG tube.

Once it starts it will take 5-7 days to completely get better. Unless the kid's having low urine output or very dull or excessively sleepy or blood in motion or green bilious vomiting...you need not worry. There is no need to use antibiotics unless there is blood in the motion. Antibiotics might worsen if unnecessarily used causing antibiotic associated diarrhoea.I suggest you use zinc supplements (Z&D drops 1ml once daily for 14 days) & ORS (Each small packet mixed in 200ml of potable water and keep giving sip by sip) as hydration is very important and crucial part of treatment. If there is vomiting you can use Syrup Ondansetron (as prescribed by your paediatrician).Regarding diet - You can use cerelac...any flavour will do.

We have found that she was infected with Appendicitis. Immediately we have taken her to the children s hospital in Chennai and was treated for curing the infection on her stomach. For almost three days she was on Intra Venus medicines and from 4th day till the 8th day she was on oral medicines and few injections. After this she was completely recovered and we were told that she needs to be operated ASAP. since she was on antibiotics we have waited for almost 3 weeks to get her back to normal after which she was operated (laproscopic surgery) for the removal of her Appendics. She was normal for two months after the surgery and during August 2010, she was complaining again about stomach pain. The doctors confirmed again that everything is ok. But even then she used to complain about the pain. The pain became worse during Nov 2010 and we did all the Ultra Sound scanning again and the reports seemed to be normal. We had visited the surgeon who had operated her and instead him to do a thorough check and he had said that she had got a severe constipation problem which we need to look into and it has to controlled through our food and he said he had given a medicine of low dosage (duphalac) which we need to continue for 3 months. Last week we have observed her bringing the water bottle as is from her school. This means she didn t drink water. On investigations we have found that for many days she had not even passed urine in the school. We have found out that she is not drinking enough water. Though we already know that she had a constipation issue, we don’t want her to face the urinary infection related issue and hence we have completely changed her intake habits in the last four five days by including more fibrous food in her diets and also included 1 banana during her dinner and evening snacks. Also ensure that she drinks atleast 1.2-1.4 Liters of water daily. We have seen a remarkable change in the last two three days after implementing the above changes. But still we are seeing that she is facing difficulty while passing her stools. I mean she is passing it in a very low/medium quantity. We still feel that she is not passing her stools completely. She is complaining about her stomach pain only during passing the stools. This is the entire case history of my daughter s stomach ache problem. Now my questions are as follows: a) How to improve the quantity of her stools without increasing her food? How to ensure that she passes the stools completely? Is there anything else to be followed? b) It seems that we have identified her problem. Now we need to understand how to cure it. Kindly let me know if our analysis is right? Is she got the stomach pain due to constipation? Or could there be any other problems - Kindly advice. c) If it is due to constipation - Then how do we cure this constipation problem? Will taking 15 ml of duphalac daily during the night after dinner for the next three months cure constipation? Or is there any other way for curing it earlier? Once if it is cured is there any chances that it can recur again? How to avoid it in the future? d) What are all the other causes of stomach pain? (Other than appendicitis, gas problem, worm problem and constipation).","Doctor":"dear parents this is a concern for majority of parents at or around your stage. dufalc is not a parmanent solution. you have written about banana what about rest of the diet. since its chronic now it will take long. add ladies finger, guava, papaya, in her regular diet.take her to a surgeon and check out for anal fissure. as she might have one or two and that could well be the cause of not passing stools completely. stop any chilly or papper for the time being. spend some time with her and listen to her. while offering her fruits n salds have it yourself too. have one meal together and share your experiences and listen to her. give her a cup of milk with honey and a tsf of ghee before bedtime. make a habit of having a big glass of warm water as soon as she wakes up, this will cause better intestinal motility. indulge her in some sports or exercise activity and you too do it or something sporty with her. regularise her and your life, because defecation reflex has its own time and one should be up before it or it is postponed for maybe 24 hours, further adding to the problem."},{"Patient":"My 6 year old daughter has a faint white line across her nose.

He prescribed aciphex twice a day & I got better. In Jan my insurance decide to up the cost from 75 to 435 so I then started protonix . This was when I had the worst stomach pain. It took me 3-4 days to realize it must be that so I stopped taking it. Now the stomach feels sore to touch & is bloated yet not passing gas very much. Nurse today called in Prilosec 2 x a day. I have been eating much less the past week but still have soreness & bloating. One last thing is that during the time of bad pain I went to ER and they said blood work normal & also CT of abdomen normal. Both endoscopy in Oct and the CT scan 2 weeks ago show the lap band in place. I would appreciate any thoughts you may have that I should look into.

I know that it is normal for little boys to have penile erections but the other day my sisters toddler son had a strange reaction to a scary episode. Well to be short when I visited her she decided she world handwash his jacket since she didn t have anything else to wash it with. She ended up tossing it in the sink in the bathroom and washed it by hands. She placed it with the outer shield (which was the filthiest)downward and the lining was blooping up through the suds in air filled pockets, and when she tried to push one down another one emerged immediately accompanied by a rumbling sound. We didn t notice at the beginning that the boy was standing next to me, watching his jacket being submerged into water and its lining emerging through the suds as big shiny grumbling balloons, a bit curious about what happened, I noticed him, with big open eyes and open mouth, and picked him up, when he saw the balloons he jumped in my arms and peed a bit in his shorts. She took a break from washing and removed the wet shorts and we saw That his penis was a little stiff. I must say I jumped a bit but she just lauget a bit about it all, saying ”oh your pee’r is stiff” and tickled it a bit with her finger She carried him toward the sink, to show him that it was safe as they approached the sink his penis got stiffer and swelled a great deal, pushed down an airballoon with one hand making the jacket grumbling and another one emerged, while holding him with the other, he yell and now he also got some strange contractions in it as well. She asked him if he was scared, he said ”scared in peer , We thought that was a bit weird, but then again it is his way of describing how he feels but then again I thought of his peer which was still a bit stiff. We were standing for some new seconds thinking about what we was going to do about this. We realized that we probably had scared him a bit he is only three years old. We decided we would take him out of the bate fore a while and I lifted him up carrying him with me, and tried to talk with him. He again said he was ”scared in peer” Soon after his moter was asking us from the bath if he woud come back in, I thought he had calmed down a bit and walked towards the door. At first he wouldn t look but when I talked a bit with him he agreed to another very smal look though still being a bit nervous, wen we walked into the bathroom his penis stiffened again, making him complain a bit about it. He did not want to go any closer, I suggested to take him out again but then my sister decided to ask him to could carry some more detergent to her, I wasn t completely sure abort the idea but decided to go along with it, he agreed and I handed him the package of detergent and carried him to the sink, when we got closer his penis swelled again and when he delivered the detergent he got some contractions in it, and turned away. I tried to talk to him and touched the lining balloons myself he didn t want to see and turned away, I took him out a bit again and talk at bit With him before returning to the room, we stayed at the door and after a while he loosened a bit, and after a while he agreed to stay within the room. He was after a while standing at the floor walking a bit forward and backward. He was watching her and sometimes she put a hand on one balloon and pushed and when the blurp followed by a new balloon come, he yayped an almost jumped and run towards the wall, still he managed to come back after some convincing talk from us, and after a while it seamed that he actually got familiar with it and managed to see a quite deal of fun with it, to our big relief. hiss penis was still erected and each time he jumped or got at bit scared I could notice some minor contractions in it. Is that normal? I haven t seen that before? Does it have something to do with him being scared? He was also holding his hands over it a lot of times. After the episode I’ve had som thoughts, was It wrong to bring him into the bath again? When he had this reaction? Is what happened to the penis normal? Well I m probably worrying to much here, but the reaction, was a bit surprising to me as well. Am I worrying to much?

Yesterday while I was eating some broccoli w a platic fork, I heard a piece of break... The fork was missing a tip from one of the teeth\\". Strange thing is that  I looked for the tiny plastic piece  in my bowl and checked my mouth w my tongue, checked the carpet... But nothing.  A couple of hours later my left side.. under my ribcage started hurting a bit.  That's when I started wondering that I accidentally swallowed it.  The pain has continued in that section and towards the backside of my waist (right side) It's not terrible pain but it does feel as if something was stuck, poking or tearing inside.  This is rare because I have a very healthy GI tract and don't ever get this type of pain.Later yesterday while I was washing my mouth, I spit a bit of blood, nottoo much though, embedded in the mucus, same thing when I blew my nose.  Also, this morning when I brushed my teeth and it wasn't blood from my mouth, but from deep under.  It's clear now, but the pain it's still there and it's been feeling more poignant.Also, I usually go to the bathroom in the morning and all ok. But today I haven't used the bathroom at all.  Yesterday and today I drank a glass of water with a  couple of tablespoons of olive oil and haven't eaten much today in hopes of helping that possible piece of plastic to come out, but nothing.I don't know.... Should I wait?? What do you recommend??Thank you!!I don't know what to do.","Doctor":"Hi ! It is possible that the blood which came while spitting and brushing the teeth could be due to a trivial injury caused by the broken plastic. However, I do not consider that this small piece could cause the type of discomfort you have described for your abdomen and back. The small piece which you might have swallowed will with all probabilities come out in your stool matter, and you may not even notice it.The discomfort in your abdomen could be just co incidental which naturally have been attributed to the ingestion of the plastic. However, if the symptoms persist, then you should visit your family physician, who may advise you for an ultrasound abdomen/x ray abdomen for further needful.Wishing you all the best.

I have reviewed your query and here is my advice. No one wants to scare a new parent, but you also don’t want to overlook any possible problems. Keep in mind that a cute little rounded belly is absolutely normal for a toddler, and your child more than likely fits into this average shape. On the other hand, if you begin to notice that your toddler’s stomach seems more rounded than it usually does, keep an eye on the situation.It is quite possible that they are heading into another growth spurt. In this case the excessive protrusion will appear flatter within a couple of weeks. They could also be experiencing a bloating problem. Watch for any discomfort that coincides with the exaggerated belly. This could be the result of constipation or some type of food intolerance. Children who are lactose intolerant will experience diarrhea and cramps in addition to the bloating.Your doctor knows better and please watch and work with your doctor.Hope I have answered your query.

Learning to deal with frustration is a skill that children gain over time. Tantrums are common during the second year of life, a time when language skills are starting to develop. Because toddlers can't yet say what they want, feel, or need, a frustrating experience may cause a tantrum. As language skills improve, tantrums tend to decrease. This is what you can do to avoid or prevent tantrums - 1. Give plenty of positive attention 2. Try to give toddlers some control over little things 3. Keep off-limits objects out of sight and out of reach 4. Distract your child 5. Help kids learn new skills and succeed 6. Consider the request carefully when your child wants something 7.

It is quite common for babies of this age group to pass a small amount of diarrhea or loose stools soon after feeds. This need not be treated as diarrhea and especially antibiotics are not indicated. When the baby takes milk, the stomach expands - then when it is contracting it sets off a waveform which moves down the intestines and when that wave reaches the lower down rectum, a small quantity of the stool is evacuated out.

Tantrums may happen when kids are tired, hungry, or uncomfortable; or because they can't get something (for example, an object or a parent) to do what they want. Learning to deal with frustration is a skill that children gain over time. Tantrums are common during the second year of life, a time when language skills are starting to develop. Because toddlers can't yet say what they want, feel, or need, a frustrating experience may cause a tantrum. As language skills improve, tantrums tend to decrease. This is what you can do to avoid or prevent tantrums - 1. Give plenty of positive attention 2. Try to give toddlers some control over little things 3. Keep off-limits objects out of sight and out of reach 4. Distract your child 5. Help kids learn new skills and succeed 6. Consider the request carefully when your child wants something 7.

My diet was a lot of fruit and low/no fat foods. Towards the end of December 2011, I noticed that whenever I ate, no matter what it was, my abdomen would become very distended and I would have a very severe and intense feeling of fullness in my upper and mid abdomen, so intense that walking and standing is too uncomfortable to do for very long. Since then, I have slowly gained weight, fluctuating between 117-122 because eating is so uncomfortable, my symptoms are still the same. The only difference is that I don't get distended anymore, but the discomfort is the same. I am able to eat, and can keep food down. I have normal bowel movements, no constipation of diarrhea. In January of 2012, I noticed my period stopped for a couple of months, then came back irregularly and very light. I went on birth control in October of 2012 because I was still at a low weight, and just this week have decided to go off it. These past few months my period has been coming monthly, but still lighter than it has alway been. I have had many tests.     -blood test: CBC, thyroid function, celiac      -Endoscopy(after this test they told me they found very, very mild inflammation and said if I wanted to I could      try a PPI, the day I started taking it I got VERY severe heartburn(not soothed by ANY means such as antacids,      liquid lidocaine from the ER) so in the course of about a week I tried about 3 different ones and I was getting      the heartburn with ALL of them, I know it was the PPIs that caused this because once I stopped taking them      the heartburn went away and hasn't returned)     -Right upper quadrant ultrasound     -Pelvic ultrasound     -Gastric emptying study     -Barium x-ray with small bowel followthrough     -2 HIDA scans with CCK (1st one came back abnormal, 2nd one was normal, elected to have my gallbladder      out, but this hasn't fixed the problem, so am assuming it was never my gallbladder to begin with, also, have      had no negative side effects from gallbladder removal, no change in symptoms, they've just stayed the same)     -SIBO breath test     -IBD blood test panelAll of these tests have come back normal. A few ideas from various doctors I've seen are some type of functional disorder and lately they have been asking if I had tried the drug reglan. I know about reglan and I know it carries some rare but very, very serious side effects. I am not willing to just try it on a whim, since my gastric emptying study and barium x-ray were both normal. If I were to try it, I would need a lot more confidence from the doctors and tests to back up why I would try it to begin with(I also don't have most of the symptoms of a motility disorder, never had nausea or vomiting, never had constipation, no heartburn, negative SIBO test). Regarding the functional disorder, I really just don't see it. My symptoms are persistent and unchanging. I have even tried anti-depressants for about 4 months, which didn't help my symptoms at all. Symptoms do not change with my mood, and have been completely consistent for over a year now. This leads me to think that there is something going on inside my body that needs to be fixed. Some ideas I've thought about:     -parasites(I was eating a lot of unwashed fruit in the months I was losing weight and have read that in women      parasites can cause a chronic sense of fullness, but my primary care doctor refused me a stool test saying it      was impossible unless I have been out of the country)     -some type of bacteria(I know I don't have SIBO, but there are other types of bacteria)     -low stomach acid(I've read low stomach acid can produce a long lasting feeling of fullness, also I know that      very low stomach acid can produce symptoms of too much acid, maybe that's why the PPIs gave me such a      severe reaction?)     -is it possible that I just have to let my menstrual cycle just get back to 100% normal?Once again, my symptoms are as soon as I eat in the morning, I feel a heavy fullness in my mid abdominal area, that persists and increases throughout the day as I eat lunch and dinner. The only time I don't feel it is right when I wake up in the morning, before I eat. Basically, I have to go at least 10 hours without eating for the feeling to go away. The feeling isn't a stuffed, \\"I ate too much\\" feeling, since I can have the feeling and feel hungry at the same time.","Doctor":"you are haing harmone related problems and re increasing as yu are treating sympatomatically as it increses with one system to othermilk and diary proteins causes all this as they are animalproteins and these are not competible with human proteinsbut confirm by getting blood serum test for specific antibodies for milk wheat potato chana rice nuts eggmay get 1-3 foodeliminate them your all symptomps will start decreasing and the medicines which are not working will work and need vfoe med will be reuced drasrucally in nect 3 months"},{"Patient":"HI ,MY son is 7 and half month old, he was having fever and cold for four days, fever is gone he is fine, but he is having yellow sticky poop, he is doing it in drops and frequently, Immediately as he is drinking milk he is having very small amount of motion.","Doctor":"Hi, Yellow sticky stools could be due to viral infection.

Another cause of blood in stool can be dysentery , but here the blood won’t be bright red and also will be quite foul-smelling. This is caused due to infection.

Her body was on the bed and her face was below the bed with face facing downwards and she was on her tummy. It was found that her position was changed to rolling position from the normal lying back position when her head was stuck. she was crying badly and her face colour was blue. No swelling and no bruises were found on her face or head. After one week she started vomiting initially with little amount and then with high qantity and with high force. Later on, when she was 13 Weeks it was found that she had a chronic brain hamerrage but she needs no treatment, she was just kept in the hospital under observation for a week or so and her head circumference was monitered but she was perfectly fine and normal and was discharged with no treatment but just a routine and follow up check ups. Now she is 13 MONTHS old and her physical and mental growth is absolutely normal. My question is wheather that incident happened when she was just One Month can be a cause of her brain hamerrage and what is chronic brain hamerrage. And for her chronic subdural brain hamerrage its important that she must had any swelling or bruises on her face or head, which she didn t had at that time. Her head was stuck in the space between the bed and the bed but she didn t fall from the bed. And I want your expert opinion about my baby subdural brain hamerrage and what you think what would be the cause of her subdural brain hamerrage. And if that incident when my baby s head stuck between the wall and the bed is a probable cause of her brain hamerrage then why there was no visible swelling and bruises on her face or head. Or if the vomiting can be the reason of her brain hamerrage then kindly explain how? and whether that initial incident have any relation to that vomiting episode. thank you very much.","Doctor":"Hello, I do not think the vomiting is the reason for the chronic subdural hemorrhage. The abnormal position and twisting while she was on the bed could be the reason for the subdural hemorrhage. But as she is developmentally normal now I do not think there is any reason for you to worry about this. But to answer your question the hemorrhage could not be because of the vomiting but rather vomiting is the effect of the subdural hemorrhage. Hope I have answered your query.

If all the tests are negative, get treated as IBS and go for a second opinion of the Surgical Gastroenterologist, He may advise you Diangostic Laparoscopy which may find the root cause such as PID, Appendicitis, Lymph node mass or problems related to the Ovaries and tubes.Get treated accordingly."},{"Patient":"I have a pain in the left side of my abd and chest area. does not feel cardiac related.

Once it starts it will take 5-7 days to completely get better. Unless the kid's having low urine output or very dull or excessively sleepy or blood in motion or green bilious vomiting. You need not worry. There is no need to use antibiotics unless there is blood in the motion. Antibiotics might worsen if unnecessarily used causing antibiotic-associated diarrhea. I suggest you use zinc supplements (Z&D drops 1ml once daily for 14 days) & ORS (Each small packet mixed in 200ml of potable water and keep giving sip by sip) as hydration is a very important and crucial part of treatment. If there is vomiting you can use Syrup Ondansetron (as prescribed by your pediatrician). Regarding diet - You can use cerelac. Any flavor will do. Avoid fruit juices as they might aggravate diarrhea.

She was mostly breast fed and due to green frothy stool docs said it could be diarrhea but stool culture did not isolate any of the salmonella/ecoli/vibrio species. What could be the cause?","Doctor":"Hello, It seems your kid is having viral diarrhea. Once it starts it will take 5-7 days to completely get better. Unless the kid's having low urine output or very dull or excessively sleepy or blood in motion or green bilious vomiting. You need not worry. There is no need to use antibiotics unless there is blood in the motion. Antibiotics might worsen if unnecessarily used causing antibiotic-associated diarrhea. I suggest you use zinc supplements (Z&D drops 1ml once daily for 14 days) & ORS (Each small packet mixed in 200ml of potable water and keep giving sip by sip) as hydration is a very important and crucial part of treatment. If there is vomiting you can use Syrup Ondansetron (as prescribed by your pediatrician). Regarding diet - You can use cerelac. Any flavor will do. Avoid fruit juices as they might aggravate diarrhea. You can give zinc supplements & ORS apart from normal vegetarian porridges & soups. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further.

Usually, rather than fever, what is more, important is the activity of the child, in between 2 fever episodes on the same day. If the kid is active and playing around when there is no fever, it is probably a viral illness and it doesn't require antibiotics at all. Once the viral fever comes it will there for 4-7 days. So do not worry about the duration if the kid is active. Paracetamol can be given in the dose of 15mg/kg/dose (maximum ceiling dose of 500mg) every 4-6th hourly that too only if fever is more than 100F.

I am working as a Public Health Researcher (Not a medical doctor). Dr.Retheesh Public Health Researcher New Delhi.","Doctor":"Hi, Febrile seizures are seizures which occur during high fever in some kids. They usually occur form 6 months to 6 years of age and usually are self limiting after 6 years of age. They usually do not leave any focal neurological deficits also. Rather than the height of the temperature, the rapidity of the rise of temperature is more important. In general, antiepileptic therapy, continuous or intermittent, is not recommended for children with 1 or more simple febrile seizures. Parents should be counseled about the relative risks of recurrence of febrile seizures and recurrence of epilepsy, educated on how to handle a seizure acutely, and given emotional support. If the seizure lasts for longer than 5 min, buccal or intranasal midazolam (Available as Midacip Nasal spray) may be used and is often preferred by parents. If the parents are very anxious concerning their child’s seizures, intermittent oral diazepam (0.33 mg/kg every 8 hr during fever) or intermittent rectal diazepam (0.5 mg/kg administered as a rectal suppository every 8 hr), can be given during febrile illnesses. Such therapies help reduce, but do not eliminate, the risks of recurrence of febrile seizures. The infection could be either viral or UTI. Hope I have answered your query.

She recently went into Tx childrens hosptal because she had bleeding of her gums small red blood spots and lots of unexpainable bruising. They imediatly did blood work. It came back with a platelet count of 2 and hgb count of 9.8. They diagnost her with ITP. They then gave her an ivig. My daughter then started having a head ache and vomiting. I took her back into er. They said her platelet level was up to 8 and that it might be the ivig that made her ill. Well we went back for our check up a week later Her platlets where down to 2 again and hgbs low as well. They then decided to do a pacu bone marrow asperation. It came back neg for leukemia. Since we have left the hospital again she is on pretnisone and a form of zantac, along with iron. It has been 2 days now.. she recently bumped her head on the door knob... I sent pics to her hemotologist and she said it was swollen and bruised but if she isnt vomiting or complaining she will be fine.. My biggest concern is that I know her platelet count is lower because the red blood dots are increasing and she is covered in bruises. Please help me. Is ITP really this bad.. do you recommend i suggest testing for anything else? I will send you pictures if you give me and email address.","Doctor":"Hello, Because of her bleeding tendency, the hematoma (swelling) would have been large even after minor trauma. The basic treatment IVIG has been given, steroids i-e prednisone takes time to respond.

Her symptoms started when she was 2 years old and she would cry that her back hurt in her car seat, so we tried 5 different car seats and she still complained. Then it progressed to her back hurting when she would be runnin, playing and sleeping. Now that she is older she can describe her symptoms more detailed. She has a hot sensation in her back and feet, she has parasthesis of bilateral legs and incontinence of urine and stool and belly pain. She is followed by a Neurology, GI, Nephrology, Urology, Nuerosurgery, Orthopedics, Pain service, Pain Psychologist and know can figure out what is wrong. She has had 2 MRI (normal), 2 CT scans (normal), Lasix scan (normal), Nuclear bone scan (normal), VCUG (normal), ultrasounds (hydronephrosis), urodynamic studies ( abnormal- showed multiple bladder spasms), multiple blood test and urine studies ( 2 24 hour urine studies showed high protein and urea 3rd was normal but not 24 hour) and Upper GI showed gastritis.

Gave tylenol for fever and now fever s gone should i be worried?","Doctor":"Hi, It is unlikely to be directly related to the bump on the head.  It would be important you to get information from the teacher as to whether or not they witnessed your son being in any type of dazed, confused, or behaving as if he were \\"zoned out\\" for any length of time. If so, then, this would suggest the strong possibility of a concussion or mild traumatic brain injury and that should prompt a visit ASAP to his pediatrician or even a PEDIATRIC NEUROLOGIST to do a complete neurological examination. If the teachers did not notice that he had any sudden STOPPAGE of function or behaviors (which is typically what happens at the moment of a concussion if the patient does not lose consciousness) then, the likelihood this is a concussion diminishes and it just will turn out to be a very nice bruise on his head.

From your history, it seems that you have diverticulosis of the colon which caused you sharp pain due to getting inflamed and the lot of gurgling in your abdomen could be due to the irritation caused by the infection. The frank red bloody stool also goes in favour of it. Even if there is no weakness or dizziness , the ice cold pale feet are evidence for a good amount of blood loss from the body.

From your history, it is possible that you had a chance conception with a miscarriage which is partial. That is why there was dark bleeding followed by a pink discharge. Urine and blood pregnancy tests might not have become positive by this time. The only way to know is to go and consult a gynaecologist who may also go for a pelvic ultrasound of yours for a diagnosis.

I have had so many tests mri s, ct scan s , swallow a camera, drink the Berium, Finally just after the Fourth of July I started having air come out after urinating. And had another ct scan that showed acute diverticulitis with a fistula connecting bladder to the bowel, but all of that was on the left side. I got so bad that I simply couldn t walk any more. Even while taking the massive amount of pain pills I m on. I had a colon resection and the fistula removed. My surgeon said he wondered how I even got anything through that badly infected section. My surgery was three weeks ago but I still feel pain in my lower right abdomen. I am so worried that I will wind up still having this incredible pain that makes it near impossible for me to walk. I asked my surgeon if maybe that infection spread to my psoas muscle causing an abcess. Because the symptoms I have match having an abcess in the psoas muscle. I was hoping that he would take a second look at my ct scan but he just said no your problem was a fistula to the bladder not the psoas but since the infection was so bad could it have been both or do you have any ideas what else could cause this horrible pain. He said the appendix was healthy and I don t have a hernia. I want my life back","Doctor":"Hi.Thanks for your query and an elucidate history. Read and understood your problems. History of multiple investigations of MRI, CT Barium noted missing the diverticuli.Diverticulitis ultimately culminated into the fistula between the colon and the urinary bladder, good that the surgery has been successful, but the pain persists. I would advise you to go for a CT scan of the abdomen, Blood- CBC ti see for infection, kidney and liver function test.MRI of the Back including that of the the back muscles like Psoas or so just to rule out any spread or distant abscess causing this type of pain. Send Urine for culture and sensitivity as this has bacteria from the colon and may become resistant strains to cause such a problem."},{"Patient":"I have had mild upper abdominal discomfort for around 6 months. It is mainly based around the upper right abdomen, although sometimes also on the upper left. Can sometimes be worse after eating or when first waking. I have noticed today around 5 or 6 pinprick red dots scattered across both sides of my upper abdomen. Any thoughts?","Doctor":"Hi  ! You have not mentioned anything about your dietary and bowel habits. If you frequently eat from outside, it could be some kind of creeping infection of the intestines and stomach which is causing trouble for you. Amoebiasis is very common and this can give rise to hyper acidity and pain in the stomach. Hyperacidity can also occur more in empty stomach in the early morning hours. However, the site of the pain in your case is right upper abdomen and sometimes on the left also. Right side upper abdominal pain could be due to gall stones with inflammation of the gall bladder, which may inflame the pancreas with pain in the middle and left side of upper abdomen. The pinprick red dots scattered across your upper abdomen could occur due to a variety of pancreatitis. These are all the possibilities as per your history. However, I will suggest you to get yourself examined by your family physician who may advise you for undergoing an ultrasound abdomen, serum amylase and lipase estimation and some other tests as need be. Wishing you an early recovery."},{"Patient":"My son is taking Intuniv. He was on 2 mg but five days ago it was increased to 3. He seems to have a stomach virus. He has diarreah and vomiting.

We took him to the Dr. numerous times and we changed his formula a few times as well. He has been on Infamil Lipil, Enfamil Prosobee, Enfamil Gentlease and he is currently on Similac Alimentum. Changing his formulas has not made a difference at all. He lost 1lb 5oz and the Dr. decided to put him on Zantac for acid reflux (even though they re not sure that is what is wrong). We went back the following week because it hadn t made a difference and they put him on Prevacid and Zantac. Prevacid in the morning and Zantac at night which seemed to have helped for 3 days. The fourth day he begins throwing up again. We have took him back to the Dr. 2-3 times a week for the past 2 weeks for a weight check. He did get back up to 11 lbs 14 ounces. So a few days ago I noticed that he had brown pieces of something in his throw up and had been watching it. Yesterday all he was throwing up was brown. Looked like used snuff that my grandma use to use. We took him to what is supposed to be one of the better hospitals in the area last night and after doing blood work, catheter and x-rays they cannot tell us what is wrong.

It is quite common for babies of this age group to pass a small amount of diarrhea or loose stools soon after feeds. This need not be treated as diarrhea and especially antibiotics are not indicated.

With months the pain hasn t changed much, it has become slightly easier to point the location on my stomach, in the beginning i could show just the area. Sometimes it feels it has moved bit to lower abdominal, sometimes it feels like hurting just below my rib cage (most common in horizontal from navel). Also for last two months my bowel movements are loose and light or yellowish. I do not have to go too often, just 1-2 times a day. Also i have noticed that lately all my stomach is more sensitive than it used to be, sometimes hurts after some foods, sometimes slight heartburn . So far I had whole abdominal ultrasound, which was okay. Had some liver blood tests, also okay. What could be the problem? What tests should I do? Im female, 28, not taking any medications, no other diseases than endometriosis .","Doctor":"Hi ! On your abdominal pain, it could be due to the following:   1) As a known case of endometriosis, there could be extra uterine deposits in the abdomen which might be giving rise to the pain along with the back pain.  2) Your ultrasound has come out to be normal and so we can exclude any endrometrial ovarian cyst and also any possibility of gall stones.I would like to know about your food habits as well. If you are a frequent fast food eater from outside home, then intestinal amebiasis has to be excluded which is a common problem. Please consult your family physician  on this. Also to be kept in mind is gluten sensitivity which is an allergy to a component of the food specially in most of the fast foods.

It will initially start with vomiting and then proceed on to diarrhea. Once it starts it will take 5-7 days to completely get better. Unless the kid's having low urine output or very dull or excessively sleepy or blood in motion or green bilious vomiting...you need not worry.

Fever is rsing in evening and in midle of night he also shivers. We are giving paracetamol for fever. Why he is getting fever with shivering only in night? Is our medication correct? Should we take him to paeditrician right away?","Doctor":"Hello, Shivering during high fever is common. Fever of a few days without any localizing signs could as well a viral illness. Usually, rather than fever, what is more, important is the activity of the child, in between 2 fever episodes on the same day. If the kid is active and playing around when there is no fever, it is probably a viral illness and it doesn't require antibiotics at all. Once the viral fever comes it will there for 4-7 days. So do not worry about the duration if the kid is active. Paracetamol can be given in the dose of 15mg/kg/dose (maximum ceiling dose of 500mg) every 4-6th hourly that too only if fever is more than 100F.

This can be confirmed by an EEG . It will be helpful you can forward a video of the episode. You should also consult a neurologist. Hope I have answered your query.

It is red but not painful, has had it for a couple of years. My Pediatrician didn t see too worried, but is causing to have itching and the smell is not pleasant. I clean it and keep it moist with bacitracin. Should I be worried. No fever or sign of infection.","Doctor":"Hi, The foul smell from the naval is commonly due to lack of proper cleaning more so if it is a bit inverted, have a pit, where there more are chances of collection of dirt and bacteria. This will happen more in those who sweat a lot. In case of your son, there is no redness, swelling, pain or any other sign of infection and your Pediatrician has examined him.

Her doctor prescribed her nystatin for her mouth and rash, but only her mouth is getting better. She has been on the medicine for 7 days. I have tried everything from washing the area with warm water and no soap, patting it dry , letting her wear no diaper and putting on every ointment every change. Is there a stronger ointment? What should I do?","Doctor":"Hi, The diaper rash occurs when a wet diaper in a baby is not changed and is allowed to stay too long. It happens most of the times at night. The wet diaper makes the skin over hydrated, wrinkled, soft and more prone to sloughing and getting a secondary infection, both bacterial and fungal. You should use diaper rash cremes available to prevent rashes. For severe rashes as in your baby, I use Siloderm mix to be applied 3-4 times a day. This has an antibacterial, antifungal, and a mild topical steroid. Keep the area dry and expose to the sun if possible. Avoid using a diaper for a few days and if at all make sure to change if wet.

This is why she has been already advised for a CT scan of the abdomen. You doctor may also advise your wife to have a serum amylase and lipase test which usually are increased in inflammation of pancreas. Till she gets other investigations done, she should completely avoid alcoholic beverages ( if she used to take ), go for bland diet without any spices and fat with a lot of roughage in it, and can go for some kind antacid and acid reducing agent like omeprazole,pantropazole, or rabeprzole after consulting her doctor.

I suggest you use zinc supplements (Z&D drops) & ORS as hydration is a very important and crucial part of treatment.

Since then, she has not been sleeping well, her stool is white in color and she has developed a terrible diaper rash. Before whole milk she was drinking Similac Sensitive (lactose-free). Two days ago I switched her back to the Similac and her diaper rash has cleared and her stool color looks normal again. Do you think she is lactose intolerant? What milk should I feed her?","Doctor":"Hello, The lactose deficiency causing lactose intolerance may be primary that is since birth or may be acquired. The acquired intolerance is following an episode of intestinal infection resulting in gastroenteritis. The most common cause is rotavirus infection. This infection results in temporary lactose intolerance due to the resulting damage to the superficial intestinal lining of the intestines, the brush border cells, which produce an enzyme called lactase, needed to digest the lactose present in the milk. The symptoms improve once the cell lining recovers. Did you breast feed your child? If so and if your child was tolerating the breast feeds then primary lactose deficiency is ruled out. Why were you giving your baby lactose-free milk? Was that after an episode of loose stools? A routine Stool examination with the presence of reducing substances will help in diagnosis. A breath test is also available. However, it may not be possible to do in a small child. It is recommended that you keep your baby off all dietary products containing lactose for a period of 2-4 weeks and then gradually reintroduce them. Hope I have answered your query.

I would like to know the investigation done to diagnose your case as diverticulitis ( if colonoscopy / CT scan was done ). In that case the treatment of diverticulitis ofcourse is a proper course of antibiotics, anti inflammatory, which you already had and got relief. Surgery is not always required for diverticulitis unless it gets complicated. You should go for a high roughage diet with plenty of liquids. Avoid alcohol and smoking if you do. These may prevent further attacks of diverticulitis. However, your treating doctor may advise you to go an annual check up with colonoscopy depending on the severity of your diverticulosisl. The bleeding per rectum which got recently seems to be because of your hemorrroids. However, if it recurs then you should see your doctor for a review. Good luck."},{"Patient":"My son Enzo is 9 years old and just recently has started having migraines every other week. I am certain that a lack of magnesium may be the culprit and should be considered in his case. The following factors have led to my deduction: 1)     Night Terrors: Enzo is soon to be ten years old, and he has suffered from severe night terrors since he was ten months old. During the terrors his muscles tighten and become rigid. After years of tests and examinations, experimenting with homeopathic remedies, and sleep training methodologies, I determined when Enzo was five years old that lack of magnesium could be the cause. 2)     Magnesium Water: Enzo began a regime of drinking nothing but Smart or Propel water when he was five years old. Soon after introducing magnesium through water into Enzo s diet his night terrors drastically declined. Admittedly, I stopped introducing magnesium through water about four months ago. 3)     Migraines: Over the last month Enzo has started to experience migraines. Magnesium is a factor in reducing migraines. Once again Enzo is experiencing a side effect that is associated with low magnesium through this new onset of migraines. 4)     Tics: Enzo also has suffered from tics, specifically rapid and repetitive blinking, since he was about five years old. Tics are associated with low magnesium as well. 5)     Height: Enzo is significantly shorter than the rest of his classmates. Failure to thrive is also a symptom of low magnesium. 6)     Salt: There are other atypical issues that stand out in Enzo s routine. For example, Enzo s need to add salt to food or lick rocks or sand so he can taste the element s saltiness. This has been an ongoing issue with Enzo his entire life and the need do salt has been linked to identifying low magnesium. 7)     Seizure-Like Blasts: Although Enzo does NOT suffer from seizures; an EKG identified small blasts in Enzo s frontal lobe when he was five years old. Despite the small blasts not progressing as to register as an actual seizure, the blasts did appear each time a terror occurred. Seizures can also be associated with low magnesium. Based on the above listed atypical issues, I believe magnesium testing should be performed, as well as any other testing that can help to determine the cause of his deficiency or excessive need for magnesium in his system. I appreciate your guidance and help with this unceasing matter. Thank you.","Doctor":"Hello, Headaches are common among children. since the headache in your son is not accompanied by any neurological symptom it is probably not serious. It is advisable to rule out common causes like sinusitis and refractive errors. Try to treat him first with lifestyle modifications ie. proper sleep, less exposure to sunlight, adequate fluid intake and stress management. Enzo may require an MRI brain to rule out any neurological cause for headache. During a severe attack, a pain killer and an antiemetic will give relief. Hope I have answered your query.

One reason is related to lower hormone values in the blood. This or some other sex steroid problem may cause low testosterone or other hormone levels to be low. This can cause the genitalia to be smaller in size and they may not be easily visible. Usually, getting an assay for enzymes related to these disorders would help and a Pediatrician would be able to suggest the best tests. Alternatively, it is also possible for a local inflammation or injury to cause the penis to be buried. This may happen in case an infection has happened right after the circumcision. In case of an infection, the baby would be feeling pain and would be irritable, crying, and may not feed well. Seeing a pediatrician confirm this would be a good idea.

I had the leg removed and he underwent four rounds of chemo. He is now four months past his last chemo and x-rays and scans show no evidence of anything (blood work in not back yet). I am currently feeding him a grain free diet with added protein (chicken or steak) at each meal (breakfast and supper) and one cup of steamed (steamed fresh at each meal and the water is then poured over his dry food) vegetables (broccoli, orange cauliflower, purple cauliflower, brusell sprouts, and carrots) at each meal. I have also added K9 Immunity plus daily. He also gets 1/3 of a cup of criminni mushrooms simmered in chicken broth once a day at supper. Bruiser weighs 25 pounds; are my portions big enough? Should I increase portions? Should I add anything else? I feel terrible as he broke his leg when he was three and I took him to an orthopedic surgical specialist who put a steel plate in to save the leg. His leg was so shattered (he jumped from one couch to the other and missed) that only the top three screw and bottom four screws were holding the plate in place. The middle five had nothing to screw into. He was crated for four months while he healed and we were told he only had one chance and if it did not work they would have to go back and amputate. He was good as gold all summer as we placed his crate in the morning sun and then in the shade in afternoons and back into camp at supper time. When I questioned the diagnosis of osteosarcoma because I thought it was a big dog disease I was told his was plate induced . If I knew that saving the leg was dangerous I never would have done it. Bruiser is a very special dog who has been through a lot --turned in to the local shelter by his breeder when he was 6 months old (because he had cherry eye and was worthless ), adopted twice and returned within two days because of the cherry eyes -- shattered his leg when he was three years old, diagnosed with polyarthritis when he was five years old and had to have a corneal graft at Cornell. Just as they were getting him on the table for surgery his eye perforated and they had to put in a piece of pigs bladder before doing the graft. He is the sweetest, most loving dog I have ever had (and I have had 30 dogs during my life) and I want to do whatever I can to prolong his life. Please tell me what size my portions should be, what other foods I should add, and if there are any other supplements I should add. Thank-you so much for offering to help","Doctor":"Hello, You must be a very kind person who is sincerely devoted to your dog.

Since last Wednesday, he s been having stomach pains, headaches (which he says bad head ), and getting this sickness feeling inside. He s 23 years old, he s got cerebral palsy, but can still walk (goes side to side though), and he s been going out most of these days, either with one of his friends, just walking to places, or out shopping with his mother.) I was wondering if you could help me in finding out what s going on with him/his body? Thank you so so much if you answer a.s.a.p.! :)","Doctor":"Hi.Thanks for your query.Since your friend is having cerebral palsy, his not going to the Doctors is understood, but if required one has to go for it. Stomach pains, headaches, feeling sick inside indicates the possibility of enteritis and may need a treatment with antibiotics and supportive medicines.Since these medicines are prescription medicines you have to take him to the Doctor, and this will help him and you to get a clinical evaluation, physical examination and proper prescription and investigations like Widal and sugar if need be."},{"Patient":"I am age 16 i weigh 117 pounds and i have pain on my lower right side of my abdomen.

From your history it seems that you have got a respiratory tract infection, either viral or bacterial along with possible broncho spasm. In either case , you are likely to get infection of your meseteric lymph nodes of abdomen (mesenteric adenitis ) which may give rise to pain in the lower right side of your abdomen, though it is more common in younger age groups. This may present itself as symptoms of acute appendicitis as is partially in your case. Also, because of you being over weight with chronic cough, could land into developing an inguinal hernia which in its initial stages may give rise to pain in the lower abdomen.It is suggested that you get yourself checked by a surgeon to exclude any co existence of these conditions in the present scenario. You have not mentioned about your bowel habits. If you are constipated, then you might have developed a fissure( a cut in the skin of your anal area) which may give rise to small amount of bleeding in stool from time and again.

I am preasently staying in UAE","Doctor":"Hi, Febrile seizures are seizures which occur during high fever in some kids. They usually occur from 6 months to 6 years of age and usually are self-limiting after 6 years of age. They usually do not leave any focal neurological deficits also. Rather than the height of the temperature, the rapidity of rise of temperature is more important. In general, antiepileptic therapy, continuous or intermittent, is not recommended for children with 1 or more simple febrile seizures. Parents should be counseled about the relative risks of recurrence of febrile seizures and recurrence of epilepsy, educated on how to handle a seizure acutely, and given emotional support. If the seizure lasts for longer than 5 min, buccal or intranasal midazolam (Available as Midacip Nasal spray) may be used and is often preferred by parents. If the parents are very anxious concerning their child’s seizures, intermittent oral diazepam (0.33 mg/kg every 8 hr during fever) or intermittent rectal diazepam (0.5 mg/kg administered as a rectal suppository every 8 hr), can be given during febrile illnesses.

It is quite common for babies of this age group to pass a small amount of diarrhea or loose stools soon after feeds. This need not be treated as diarrhea and especially antibiotics are not indicated.

This is the basis for gastro-colic reflex. Do not worry. Unless the kid's having low urine output or very dull or excessively sleepy or blood in motion or green bilious vomiting...you need not worry.

Usually, rather than fever, what is more, important is the activity of the child, in between 2 fever episodes on the same day. If the kid is active and playing around when there is no fever, it is probably a viral illness and it doesn't require antibiotics at all. Once the viral fever comes it will there for 4-7 days. So do not worry about the duration if the kid is active. Paracetamol can be given that too only if fever is more than 100F. I suggest not using combination medicines for fever, especially with Paracetamol. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further.

I understand your concerns and I will try to help you as much as I can.treating constipation in such small babies ahould be managed by simple changes to your child’s diet and potty training can help treat constipation. You may notice a difference within a few days. Sometimes it takes a few weeks before their symptoms improve. Make changes to your child’s diet Give your baby extra water between their normal feeds if they haven’t started to eat solid food yet. If you’re using formula milk, don’t add more water to the mixture. Try gently moving your baby’s legs in a bicycling motion or carefully massaging their tummy to help stimulate their bowels. Give older children plenty of fluids and encourage them to eat fruit. Chop or puree it if it’s easier for them to eat. The best fruits for constipation include apples, grapes, pears and strawberries. Don’t force your child to eat as this can make mealtimes stressfulI hope I have answered you query. If you have any further questions you can contact us in every time.Kindly regards. Wish you a good health."},{"Patient":"My 3 year old son is having a fever for last 3 days yesterday the doc gave a vaccination for fever to reduce also for cough to come down ... also suffering from sever chest conjestion and cough now he has started passing frothy motion is it because of the mucus or something more serious","Doctor":"Hi Dear,Understanding your concern.

Sometimes regular dose may not work and a higher dose may be required. Plus if there is need for an antibiotic to control infection, then that needs to be given along with either of these drugs.

She did this twice. About 2 weeks ago, she had a week of strange stomach issues (somewhat viral in nature) but did not show any other symptoms of having a virus (fatigue, etc). She woke one night 4 times and had soaked through her clothes with accidents. This was very uncommon and since she had been having stomach issues during the week, we took her to the ER (as our insurance will not cover urgent care anymore - Tricare), and they tested for bladder/UTI. She was fine. I don t know if they are all related, but she has seemed fine otherwise. I m mostly concerned with the chest issue and that some of these symptoms are similar to symptoms I experienced with issues with Chiari Malformation Type 1. I had decompression surgery two years ago. I also had these very symptoms she is describing when I was child in the 80s, but of course there is no way of telling if they were Chiari related then. My parents were told I had a form of rheumatoid arthristis. My symptoms did reappear and worsen of course in my mid 30s and I had the surgery. I gave my daughter TUMs this mornign thinking chest pains are normally not worrisome with children, but we are very healthy eaters and she has never done this.
