Chronic sinusitis is a really disturbing condition. Due to nasal congestion and blockadge breathing becomes laborious and incomplete which lead to these king of symptoms.If i would be your treating doctor then i would have done following things.1- Detailed history of patient to have insight into causative or precipitating factors.2- Radiological investigation preferably contrast CT of sinuses.3- Endoscopic evaluation and biopsy for observing lesion and specimen for bacterial and fungal culture. Immunological tests for allergen must be done to prevent exposure to various allergens.4- Treatment initially will be directed to suspected pathogen in form of antibiotics and symptomatic relief.5-  if after medical measures it is not relieved then ENT surgeon must be consulted and evaluation should be done for surgery.6- Regarding diet food allergen must be avoided.Only garlic has proven to be beneficial in chronic sinusitis by various studie. So it should be included in diet.I hope i have answered your concern in best possible way. I will be glad to help you further.Regards.Dr Jigar."},{"Patient":"Barky cough for almost a year.

I was diagnosed with HPV a few yrs ago and have been battleing outbreaks periodically ever since. Had an appointment today with my gynocologist, for what i thought was a breakout. However, she tells me that it is cholesterol buildup. Can you tell me more about this?","Doctor":"Hello dear,Thank you for your contact to health care magic.I read and understand your concern. I am Dr Arun Tank answering your concern.HPV is the STDs or sexually transmitted infection.It is caused by the human papilloma virus infection. It has nothing to do with the cholesterol built up. Cholesterol is type of fat and can not cause STDs like HPV.There is nothing a outbreak like in this condition. So if you have HPV you should take the treatment as per the disease state and your clinical condition.There are various treatment modalities available like imiquimod, cold laser, phenolic cauterisation. But all have merit and demerit as per the situation of the patients.If your sexual partner have the same infection than avoid the sexual act till you are free from the infection.

So avoid using the sanitory napkins for the baby for long time.If it's the fungal infection then taking the antifungal drugs can cure the infection, fluconazole oral suspension or in better part topical application of the fluconazole is the final treatment. Doctors supervision is necessary in this case.Please maintian good local hygiene this will help cure the infection at earliest. Please test the babies blood sugar and HIV status.

I have reviewed your query and here is my advice. I passed carefully through your question and would explain that palpitations could be related to many situations: anxiety, physical activity, anemia, thyroid gland dysfunction, electrolyte imbalance, etc. Coming to this point, I would recommend checking your thyroid hormone levels and performing a cardiac ultrasound and an ambulatory 24-48 hours ECG monitoring in order to investigate for possible cardiac arrhythmia. If all the above tests result normal, you should consider anxiety as the main cause of palpitations. Regarding high GGT, I would recommend repeating this test after a week just to be sure that it is OK. An abdominal ultrasound for gallbladder stones may be needed. Hope I have answered your query.

I went to see my GP on the third day and he advised that I could suffer from peptic ulcers( which has been an answer from the past 7 times I have been to the dr). I was given meds for the ulcers as he also picked up from my allergy tests that I have a substance/ organism thats causing ulcers. Amongst my meds I also got anti-histamin and flygen to clear my urine as there was traces of blood on my urine. However, its been three days of taking the meds and I still have nausea which now includes what feels like shortness of breath and fatique during the evenings. In addition, my GP said he is bothered by the pulse on my abdomen which he found the first time during the exam for ulcers. I feel tired in the mornings, nauseous for the whole day and my chest feels a bit heavy. I still come to work as normal but the day is a bit more difficult to get through than normal. I also have a constant urge to burp but nothing ever comes up. Should I go back to my GP and ask for a referal for a gastroscope or just wait for the meds / antibiotics to finish and then go back?

If you have Helicobacter pylori as the stomach infection causing your ulcers then it may take several weeks for the medications to work and give you some relief.

Your doctor should go for Blood culture for salmonella which is the gold standard for the diagnosis and it will also confirm to which antibiotics it is sensitive and responds.2) Chloramphenicol is one such drug which should not be used when other safe drugs are available.

In your case it should not be used at least in second time of illness.3) for current illness my recommendation is do complete blood count and other blood tests after consulting a Infectious disease specialist to rule out side effects of chloramphenicol.

You haven't mentioned the treatment you've received and whether you've used something for the allergic reaction yourself besides aspirin. I'm telling this because one of the most common side effects of certain antihistamines is headache and I guess that taking an antihistamine must have been given to you at the hospital. So a common headache that became worse can be caused by an antihistamine. Shortness of breath and faintness (that's what you meant by \\"faitage\\"?) are not common side effects but they may occur sometimes. An allergic reaction may present with various symptoms. Faintness and shortness of breath are the most serious ones because they may lead to loss of consciousness and worse. In cases like that, urgent assessment in the ER is recommended.

I am happy that you're back to normal again now with God's Miracle and Graces. I am also sorry to hear that you are going through a severe cough and cold and slight fever due to inflammed tonsils.

I understand your concern. Pus in stool may be due to dysentery, malabsorption or eating diet rich in fats. Does she have fever, abdominal pain or vomiting? If yes, then infection due to shigella or amoebic dysentery can be there. She should be given antibiotics so you should visit your pediatrician. In absence of these symptoms, it can be due to malabsorption or high fat diet. Is she taking more amount of butter, cheese, cream, oil etc recently? If yes then reduce the amount & see if the symptoms persist? Hope this will be helpful.

I have had no pain at all and the white thing is not brushed off by toothbrush and does not bleed.Is this really candida?","Doctor":"Hello,Welcome to HCM,I understand your concern.White patch on tongue which cannot be brushed nor scraped, suggests it's a leukoplakia(refers to a condition where areas of keratosis appear as firmly attached white patches on the mucous membranes of the oral cavity).It is a diagnosis of exclusion(once all other causes are ruled out). Oral leukoplakia more commonly occurs in those who smoke,chew tobacco. Leukoplakia is a premalignant lesion, i.e. \\"a morphologically altered tissue in which cancer is more likely to occur than in its apparently normal counterpart\\". But the vast majority of oral leukoplakias will not turn malignant.If thats the case it is recommended to recommendation that possible causative factors such as smoking and alcohol consumption be stopped.If the size of patch increases in size, has to br reviewed by physician.Hope this information was useful.

(IN MEDICAL TERMS:- Lacerated wound over the distal IP joint of Index finger and distal part attached with only a 1 cm wide band of tissue and skin. Capillary refill on Index finger > 3 sess. - I have copied from the medical report they gave me) Immediately the same day late that night i got Rabipur Vaccination done.  2nd and 3rd vaccinations of repetitions were done on time.  the 4th Vaccination got delayed by an week and the 5th vaccination also by an week.  As the injury was deep and my index finger was almost hanging on moss or skin, they have also mentioned that only one vessel was intact.  They had also advised to go for Immunoglubolin (6 vials), as i could not afford immunoglobulin ( 6 vials) i could not go for it. I got the surgery done and they placed a K-WIRE driven in retrograde function into the distal phalanx and then advanced into the middle phalanx across site (Medical term copied).  Even now (26 Oct 2011) i am with stitches on around my Index finger.  Sometimes even now it slightly pains.  To talk about the dog we already got it Sedated the 2nd day as it became a threat to local people around there, so the question of dog being alive or dead or sick is not viable.

So ulcer can occur because of nutirtuonal deficiency.You should take the complete treatment for the Giardia. Otherwise it will recurr and cause infection again and again.It is transmitted by feco oral route means either the food or water is contaminated with such parasite is consumed by you causing the infection to you. I advice you should maintain hygiene in the future otherwise contaminated food causes infection again.In order to combat such effect you should take multivitamin particularly the vitamin A and others. This will help treating the ulcer.I will be happy to answer your further concern on bit.ly/DrArun.Thank you,Dr Arun TankInfectious diseases specialist,HCM."},{"Patient":"I just had cath yesterday and was found 50% blockage at LAD bifurcation and a 70 blockage in circumflex artery.

Actually ulcer develops after 3-4 weeks of vaccination.The reaction in your case might have started within hours after vaccination and a large weeping ulcer is formed within few hours later.This is an exaggerated and accelerated reaction suggestive of  previous infection with Mycobacterium tuberculosis.Size of the erythema, induration, nodule, pustule, ulcer and scar all are bigger than those in the uninfected. Ulcer will heal into the scar earlier. Application of antiseptic agents can lead to local irritation & hence to be avoided. However if you develop infection or abscess you will have to take oral antibiotics. Kindly consult your doctor for the interpretation of the results with clinical correlation.

Seizure control is individualized, so you'd better stick to your neurologist's advice regarding the treatment measures that have to be taken.

Regarding your blood pressure, it is possible that your blood pressure is not under good control although random high readings may occur in every patient.

If the infections around the bites are cleared up, I wouldn't worry about them anymore. The flies themselves don't have anything that would cause such symptoms this long after.

Depending on the type of antibiotic, there can be other side effects like dizziness and weakness. This should clear up in a couple of days. If not, or if it's getting worse, contact your doctor.

I understand your concern and will try to give best possible guidance.I would like to know for what reason you have been adviced for colonoscopy..As such complications are not common following colonoscopy.. But It appears in your case that you got infected most probably due to injury to your bowel. As there are plenty of bacterias into gut they might have entered from injured gut walls into your blood and caused septicemia.You should inform this to your doctor who did the procedure..It is good to know that you are fine now but be watchful for any rise in temperature or fall in blood pressure..Wish you a good health.Dr Jigar."},{"Patient":"Hi I am a 36yr old male who has chicken pox.

I began having yeast infections in which diflucan helps only a little.The diflucan causes my skin on my head to become more irritated.  I noticed the skin on my head and back became more irritated after developing these yeast infections after the surgery.  I'm trying not to take the  diflucan pills.

I was diagnosed with HPV 3-4 years ago after a routine pap that came back abnormal. My PCP said at that time we would have to keep an eye on it and that it was nothing to worry about. I have been complaining of intense anal itching for years and have been prescribed various steroid creams that do not seem to have any effect on the itching. I had a colonoscopy 3 years ago after finding a small amount of blood in my stool and was diagnosed with minor internal hemroids. I was told it was just a fact of life that I would have itching, and to eat more fiber. Recently (6 months ago) I noticed some irregularity at the opening of my anus (like a vericose vein) and went back to the doctor (who performed the colonoscopy years before) and after a very brief visual inspection with no internal inspection, he advised to just eat more fiber and prescribed another steroid cream (proctosol-hc 2.5%). I have used the cream pretty regularly (6-8 x s a week sometimes multiple times a day) and I find no relief. I literally am losing it, the itching is often so intense that I have to leave stores/public places to urgently address the itching. I often itch so much that I bleed and I am kept up most nights by the unrelenting itch. There is a strange whitish pastey discharge that seems to make the itching more intense that I try to keep clean. (I told all this to the colonoscopy doctor, who seemed unconcerned). I recently noticed the itching seems to have gone from the external area to the internal edge of my anus. Today, while trying to itch the edge of my anus internally i found a smal bump with an irregular surface on the inside of my anus, maybe a 1/2 inch inside and 1/8 inch in diameter, near the external vericose vein like area. It is not painful but it is in the area I have the most itching and I am afraid maybe it is a wart - which is totally humiliating - or a dangerous growth. It is not smooth like hemroids are explained, but solid, hard, irregularly shaped and rough surfaced. My PCP and the colonoscopy doctor have repeatedly done NOTHING about my complaints, and have made me feel very discouraged and hopeless. I am very hesitant to call or see either of them for this bump, as I feel they will say the same thing they have said for years - more fiber and steroid cream - and I will feel VERY awkward asking for such a complete probe to find the growth. My questions are - could this itching and the recent developement of the bump be a serious condition, like anal cancer? how can I get relief from this condition and get some quality sleep without waking multiple times a night itching (procedure/surgery/drug)? Should I find a new doctor(s), and what type of doctor should I consult first (specialist or PCP)? can you advise what procedures/test should be run, even precautionary, so I can insist that they are done? Is a anal pap an option for a woman? Thank you in advance.","Doctor":"Hello,Welcome to HCM,Human Papillomavirus (HPV) affects only the skin and it will be localized to the wart. Once the wart is cleared by topical application of cream you will become free from infection.It is transmitted to your partner, if you indulge in unprotected sexual activity during the presence of lesion. Once the wart is cleared by the topical medicines you can have normal sexual activity and you will be non infectious.5% Imiquade cream should be applied over the wart on alternate days for 4 months. Before application of this cream you need to apply Vaseline over the wart and then you have to apply the imiquade cream.Mean while you have to boost up your immunity which helps to clear your wart. To boost the immunity you need to take orally capsule Zincolac, daily for 30 days.Thank you."},{"Patient":"My son got stung by a honey bee last night it has been 24hrs he has swelling in the hand from the sting. he is running a fever 100-102 off and on. is this normal? this is his third bee sting in the last couple years. does he need medical attention or what can be done at home","Doctor":"Hello,Welcome to HCM,When bees sting a person they will inject venom through their stinger into the skin of the victim.People stung by bees will have an allergic reaction to the sting and in severe cases it will causes anaphylaxis.For any Bee sting, following measures should be followed1.If the stinger is present remove it immediately. 2.Apply ice or cold packs to the area to reduce the body's inflammatory reaction.3.Wash the area with soap and water4.Take antihistamine such as Benadryl.5.Pain relievers such as ibuprofen or acetaminophen can also provide relief of symptom.Aforementioned measures should followed whenever there is a bee sting.Thank you"},{"Patient":"Hi there I am about to go for frozen embryo transfer sometime next week (depending upon when I ovulate) and have just been exposed to chicken pox - my niece has just developed spots today, my nephew has crusted spots.

I had a 2 hours flight and I was smelling a bad odor and wondering where it is coming from. Eventually I found out it was coming from my bellybutton which has left yellowish traces on my shirt. It continued for 2 days and all the tiny hair inside y bellybutton was moistured and a white substance was surrounding the roots of my bellybutton hair. I cleaned my bellybutton after that and all the hair was cut from its roots just like a plant! From that day I have been cleaning my bellybutton with salty water and drying it carefully but still, a drop or two of yellowish fluid (probably pus) is coming after several hours. So no matter how much I dry it, after few hours I notice that deep inside it is wet!  I am 35 years old, 178 cm, 71 KG with perfect health and without any precedent with my belly button. What should I do now, knowing that this matter has been going on for exactly a week now. Should I conitnue pouring salty water on it twice a day? Should I lay in the sun and make it dry? Should I stop exposing it to water for a couple of days? or maybe apply an anti-septic cream? Finally, how serious my case is? Please help.","Doctor":"Hello,This is Dr. Klarida Papaqako answering your question.I read carefully you query. From what you are describing looks like an infection of the belly button. In general, when belly button has bad smell it is caused from a fungal infection (90% of cases). So, to help with that I would:-- encourage you to continue keeping it as much dry as possible-- Peroxide Hydrogen is recommended more then salty water, so apply some of it to your belly button 1-2 times/day.-- An antifungal cream is needed. I know its not like other fungal infections, but its the fungal infection of belly button, with its characteristic symptoms. Ketoconazole 2% cream twice day, thick layer, for 2 weeks will help with it.It should not be painful or cause abdominal pain. If its not getting better or getting worse, go check it to your local doctor, so he does an ultrasound and watches whats happening behind it.

So, to overcome these problems the treatment involves the use of four or more antibiotics given in two phases.For TB affecting the spine the following regimen is used by most of the centres:In the initial phase Isoniazide, Rifampicin, Pyrazinamide and Ethambutol are given once daily for two months and  in the continuation phase Isoniazide and Rifampicin are administered once daily for a period of 12-18 months depending upon the severity of the infection involving the spine.Vitamin pyridoxine is supplemented along with Isoniazide to prevent its side effect involving the nerves.A regular followup is required to see whether the patient is taking the medication or not, improvement in the general condition, appetite, weight gain, fever etc. Lab investigations done include ESR, Chest xray sputum analysis to check the response to the treatment.Since your mother is having TB of spine and the fact that treatment is bit longer, therefore it takes time to show the improvement.

Once eaten, the eggs hatch in the intestine and develop into adult worms within 2 to 6 week Since the eggs can be easily spread, everyone in the household must be treated with the medication. Reinfection is still common because live eggs continue to be excreted in feces for up to a week after the treatmentWash your hands frequently, especially after going to the toilet, after scratching, and before eating, and keep your fingernails short to reduce the chance of picking up pinworm eggs.I hope if you take all these precautions pinworm infestation will be treated successfully."},{"Patient":"I m going back into the hospital tomorrow to have another cardioversion.

If it is an infected lymphnode how long will it take to go away? Basically when should I worry that it is something else?  Thank you.","Doctor":"Hello and thanks for your question. If it is a lymph node it can take a few months to go away. Lymph nodes swell up in response to infection so if you have any infection in your mouth, like cavities in the teeth or gum infection you can get swollen up nodes. If you have such an infection then that needs to be treated. If it is not a lymph node it could be a cyst and if it becomes large and painful then you may need to have it drained. Lastly, lymph nodes can become infected but this condition is pretty painful and you would have a lot of pain and often fevers. I hope it resolves soon."},{"Patient":"Hello. I'm only 13 and my anal area is irritated, more of itching than anything. I'm not bleeding and there is only one spot that burns, but that's only if i touch it.

If you are 13 and you are just experiencing itchiness in your anal area, it does not suggest a hemorrhoid. It must probably be caused by a small wound produced by hard stools passing through the anus. It could also be due to pin worm infestation. The worms can cause itchy anal area. If you see worms you need treatment for that. If not just try to eat vegetarian diet and stool softners for a week and see if it is relieved. You may also apply an antiinflammatory or antibiotic cream to the area. Please try that and consult again if you need more help.

I can keep her drinking if her temp stays 100 or below but right now with Ibuprofen 2 hrs ago, it is still 101.  What else can I do?

If the fever and vomiting continues or gets worse, please get her admitted to a hospital. Oral antibiotics will not be enough. She will most probably need IV Antibiotics and hospital care for the high fever. Very high fevers can be damaging to the body. Since she is only 6 years old, pyelonephritis can progress very fast and damage her kidneys too. Not saying this to alarm you but I really think your daughter needs to be taken to a hospital and treated as an inpatient until her fever breaks. She will need additional blood and urine tests.

At the same time, I want to insist that taking or advising medicines without physician's prescription is not recommended. 'Acute weakness' means a lot to me- but in your relative's case, I take it as being tired with fever. Please do not delay visiting a doctor. All fevers are not the same. Treatment is based only on the cause, which can be found out only with proper evaluation. If there is a delay in visiting the hospital, I suggest you to give him 'tepid sponging' i.e take a clean cloth. Wet it with water which is neither warm nor cold (in room temperature). Squeeze the excess water out, and wipe his body with it. This helps in reducing the temperature. If temperature is very high, you can give him one tablet of paracetamol 500 mg.

Thank you for sharing your concern with us. It does sound like it might be an infection- the armpit hurting suggests that you might have some inflamed lymph nodes. The pimple that you are noticing now might have been there for awhile and the small hole that you are talking about might be what is left of the pimple, which might have drained open already. I would suggest that you visit a doctor for a check-up and to have this problem looked into, especially since you have a breast implant. You might need some antibiotics to clear the infection, although the decision for antibiotics will be left at the discretion of your primary care physician.

(I discovered it when I leaned over to reach for something and the counter put some pressure on my abdomen.  No other symptoms but it is pretty tender.","Doctor":"Hello and thanks for your question. It is possibly a small hernia or a cyst. Hernias are separations in the abdominal muscles and a small piece of bowel can push through especially when you put pressure on the abdomen like when you bend over or cough. Cysts are small fluid filled structures that can turn up anywhere. Neither one of these are dangerous but if the pain becomes severe you would need to see a doctor right away.

So, you should expect gradual decrease in pain, warmth and redness. If it is not decreasing gradually or increasing after the procedure (which is less likely if the procedure was done adequately) then it is a matter of concern and you should visit the doctor again.It is difficulty to precisely say how long the redness and warmth will last as it depends on factors like severity of abscess and extent of procedure, but I can only say it should be decreasing over time, for which you are the best judge to decide.Hope this will be helpful.Do ask if any further question is there.Thanks for using HCM.

I experience this in the last few days of my period. My period is usually more brownish in the last few days and it gives me a severe stinging sensation whenever I pee and sex is completely out of the question. Even after my period the burning remains until I take some vaginal pessaries such as canesten. The creams do not help at all, only the pessaries seem to cure me from the burning. But then comes the next period and I have to go through this again. It seems that my period is acidic or something like that and I do not know what I can do :/ I'm 19 and do not suffer from anything else. Thanks!","Doctor":"Welcome,Yeast is a fungus that normally lives in the vagina in small numbers. A vaginal yeast infection means that too many yeast cells are growing in the vagina camera.gif. These infections are very common. Although they can bother you a lot, they are not usually serious. And treatment is simple. yeast can grow too much and cause symptoms. A yeast infection causes itching or soreness in the vagina and sometimes causes pain or burning when you urinate or have sex. Some women also have a thick, clumpy, white discharge that has no odor and looks a little like cottage cheese.These symptoms are more likely to occur during the week before your menstrual period. you can treat yourself at home with medicines you can buy without a prescription. You can use an anti fungal cream, or a suppository that you put into your vagina, or anti fungal tablets that you swallow.If your symptoms are mild, you may want to wait to see if they clear up on their own.

During spinal fusion, your surgeon places bone or a bone-like material within the space between two spinal vertebrae. Metal plates, screws and rods may be used to hold the vertebrae together, so they can heal into one solid unit.Because spinal fusion surgery immobilizes parts of your spine, it changes the way your spine can move. This places additional stress and strain on the vertebrae above and below the fused portion, and may increase the rate at which those areas of your spine degenerate.Take care."},{"Patient":"hi, my mother has been suffering from fever, nausea, stomach ache, and vomitting.

I have also been putting a prescription antibiotic cream on it and soaking it in Epsom salts every so often. I keep it covered with socks during the days and sometimes with loose-fitting socks at night and have been wearing loose-fitting, close-toed shoes. I keep it elevated as often as I can (the work day can be hard). Is there anything else I can do??? Should I be worried that it's taking so long to heal and is hurting a little bit again? Thanks!","Doctor":"Hello there,I am dr.milan an infectious disease specialist answering your question,I suggest you to take visit once of your treating physician.Because local examination is to be needed in this case.Sometimes it is neede to open the wound area, if you make it closed completely it may not heel and some secretion of sebaceous glands and sweat. make it so waxy and make it more vulnerable to be infected and not allowed it to heal.You need to check also your sugar level also.So just visit your physician once.Hope i have given appropriate guidance to you.if you have any query you can consult me anytime.Give me star rating according to your satisfactory level.Thanking you."},{"Patient":"I have a MRSA staphylococcal infection on the back of my calf. Its been draining and I am on an oral and nasal antibiotic. The culture allowed the doctor to prescribe the right oral antibiotic. My question is should I be worried if my leg, from the wound down, has doubled in size within the past 24 hours even though the wound itself looks better?","Doctor":"Hello there,I am dr.milan an infectious disease specialist answering your question,Yes definately its an alarm.You need to worry, because this type of swelling is very odd type. This is MRSA type of infection so some of antibiotic is to be avoided. And staphylococcal organism is known to cause one severe type of presentation callled toxic shock syndrome, though antibiotic is going so it will not reach to this stage mostly. But the double the size of your leg inspite of antibiotic is the very odd condition. Larger size of pus is to be drained along with proper antibiotic is the management of this type of wound.I suggest you to immediately consult your physician.

Then I stayed on Cefuroxime for 6 months (500mg twice a day.

I have had several blood test and my infectious desieze doctor assures me that I do not have any remaininig or reoccuring staph infection. How can the cefuroxime have such an enourmous effect on my pain????","Doctor":"Hello there,I am dr.milan an infectious disease specialist answering your question,I also agree with your doctor. Because sudden pain after stoping of antibiotic is not the feature related to staph infection. If infection is remaining than you have associated symptoms like fever, bodypain and many more.You have not mention your age here. I think you need to see an orthopedic surgeon. Because in later age our bone became weak and slight straining may lead to so called pathological fracture. You just go through x-ray examination and along with your serum calcium level. According to that calcium supplement can be started.You need to do suggested things.Hope i have given appropriate guidance to you.if you have any query you can consult me anytime.Give me star rating according to your satisfactory level.Thanking you."},{"Patient":"7 days ago i have been diagnosed having Chicken Pox (I am 57yrs old) on my left side (cheek) and half of upper lips including upper pallet. My GP gave me Ezovir 250mg tab to take tyhree times a day and a cream to apply on the left eye every four hrs. Now after 7 days blisters are getting dry, intermitant numb feeling in my teet, pain in my left side gum, pain on top of my scull ( painfull even i touch hair) Please explain if this is normal and goes away or something damaged permanenetly as a result of Chicken Pox. Thank you","Doctor":"You most likely have shingles and not chickenpox. Shingles is caused by the chickenpox virus. When you have chickenpox as a child, the virus goes dormant in your body and lives in a nerve. Years later it can break out in a localized area that that particular nerve controls. The chickenpox infection you had as a child may have been so mild it was not diagnosed at the time, so you may think you had no exposure, but it's unlikely to have reached the age of 57 without it since chickenpox is very contagious. Primary chickenpox is spread throughout the body, particularly on the trunk, and doesn't generally occur in a specific area as you describe. You are on the right medicine. However, since the virus lives in the nerve, it can cause an inflammation of the nerve that can be quite painful and cause numbness as well. The blisters are typically just a sign that the virus is present and sometimes don't even appear. The main thing is the nerve pain which is quite severe and can last several weeks sometimes. This is common or \\"normal\\" with a shingles outbreak. Most often it resolves with time. Hope this answers your question."},{"Patient":"Hi, I have a foot infection which is fortunately getting better after 5 weeks (it started during holiday in Thailand and China). Received now results from the hospital laboratory that I had 3 bacteria, of which one was a normal skin infection, but also Pseudonomas and ecoli. I have walked barefoot a lot (mainly beach). Had different kind of antibiotics and Clindamycine has finally worked. My question is how I can be sure, now that the wounds start healing, that these bacteria have only been in my wounds locally and did not, or will not cause damage in other parts of my body? Is a bloodtest a good idea?","Doctor":"A blood test will not be helpful. Pseudomonas and E. coli are common inhabitants of the colon. When you were walking on the beach barefoot, you might have been walking on sand contaminated by feces. If you are feeling well now and the wounds are healing, the bacteria are not likely to be in your bloodstream or organs where damage can occur (except in the colon which has mechanisms to prevent damage from the bacteria normally present). If the bacteria have gotten into your blood or organs, you will be sick and have symptoms, most likely very severe. Since you are doing okay, you don't need to worry about it. Hope this helps."},{"Patient":"my mom finished chemo for lung cancer a couple months ago. about a month ago, she got real sick with pheumonia and her electrolytes got low. what could be causing her potassium level to remain low, even with potassium supplements and even potassium IVs?","Doctor":"Alterations in the kidneys or the adrenal glands can cause changes in hormones that control levels of potassium in the body. Certain drugs can also cause a loss of potassium. This would be aggravated if the hormone balances are off, and could cause potassium loss despite supplements. Suggest she discuss further evaluation with her doctor to diagnose this possibility. Also review meds to see if one of them could be contributing and perhaps make changes in prescriptions. There are also medicines that can help retain potassium. Hope this helps."},{"Patient":"There use to be a stick that was made of hard plastic that you would squeeze to break another tube inside.  It would then produce a product that you would put on a bee sting.  Sorta looks like the thing they use to wake someone up that passed out.","Doctor":"Hello,Welcome to HCM,The sting can result in an allergic reaction due to the secretion of venom. Allergic reactions can be immediate or delayed, though immediate reactions are more common.The treatment varies slightly according to the severity of the reaction. In severe reactions (decreased blood pressure, increased pulse, hives, difficulty breathing) hospitalization is required for treatment.Where there is only swelling and rash, you can treat at home by the use of oral antihistamines such as benadryl. In addition, if the area is painful, you can use paracetamol.If the severity of the reaction worsens, then you would need to seek medical attention.If you haven't had a tetanus shot in the last 5 yrs, you also need to take a booster dose.Thank you."},{"Patient":"Is there any old home remedies to aid folliculitis symptoms on my PitBull pup?

An antifungal shampoo such as ketoconazole shampoo can be used to wash the scalp regularly. A cream containing mild steroid such as cortisone with mupirocin can be applied for few days to reduce the swelling.Do not apply any hair oil or any creamy stuff over the scalp as it causes more aggravation of the problem.

I feel my tonsils are doing more harm than good for me, should i get them removed? also what are the best home remedies for this?","Doctor":"Hello, Welcome to HCM.I understand your concern.As a home remedy for tonsillitis, you should do gargles with warm salt water or with chlorhexidine & water in 1:3 dilution. They will not treat the viral infection but prevent super-added bacterial infection. You can also take lozenges available OTC. Also take plenty of water and warm liquids.  Take paracetamol with ibuprofen for pain relief, fever and inflammation.You can get your tonsils removed if you have recurrent tonsillitis. You have said that you had this problem 6 times in 5 months. Guidelines about tonsillectomy says that it can be done if tonsillitis occurs 7 times or more in a year or 5 times or more per year for 2 years consecutively or 3 times or more per year for 3 years consecutively. So, see whether you fall in these criteria or not. Tonsillectomy can also be done if tonsillitis is severe and affecting day to day life.

Dr checked him out - said it was a virus, the fever cleared, but the cough has remained. My son has had a history of ear infections, so that is always my worry when he gets sick. I took him back to the doctor this past Monday - he was coughing a lot, but no fever, but hasn't been eating much. She said his lungs were clear, and that all looked ok and that his cough should resolve in a few days.

I had tinea curis for about 1 year and a half in the groin area. I didn't really treat it. Lately, I visited my GP. He was quite expeditive and recommended me anti-fungal creams and tablets. I've been doing the treatment for 3 weeks, no improvement except for red skin rash. Since the colour of the affected area is slightly lighter than the skin (and a bit darker on the edge of those patches) and stable (hadn't grow for a very long time), I suspect that the infection healed a while ago, but due to having it for a long time it left scars. Does that sound feasible? If yes, is there any way to remove these scars? Regarding treatment, I used Lamsil cream (Terbinafine 1% w/w) twice into the infection: once after about 6 months and then 9 months into, for about 2 weeks each time. At those times, the skin was red-ish. Recently, after visiting the doctor, I am using Trimovate Cream (clobetasone butyrate, oxytetracycline, nyastin), Canesten Cream Clotrimazole 1%w/w 20g for fungal infection and some anti-fungal pills 4 times a day for 7 days. I also use Tea Tree Oil (via a stick).","Doctor":"Thanks for asking in healthcaremagic forum   If you have infection persisting, then only you may find red bordered lesions like that.

Looking at it's chronic standing I would like you to exclude few conditions-Diabetes-In diabetes due to raised blood sugar, infections do not respond to routine treatment.You should get your fasting & post meal blood & urine sugar tested & in case it is raised- consult a Diabetologist for further investigations & specific treatment.A controlled blood sugar along with proper management of infection will heal completely.Peripheral vascular disease- This causes narrowing of peripheral blood vessels & condition needs to be excluded, as it causes chronic infections, more so in lower limb.The diagnosis is made by USG-Doppler, angiography, computerised Tomography.Please consult a surgeon for his expert advise For management of the wound as well as peripheral vascular disease.A detailed CBC, Hb% & culture & sensitivity of the exudate from the infection site are usually done to define the exact causative organism & the sensitive antibiotic, medicine will be selected.Local management of the infection ulcer with proper cleaning, removal of dead tissue & application of healing agent is to be followed regularly till complete healing.

His left ventricle failed during the operation and he was in a very serious state for some time. Today he is complaining of rushing water noises in one ear and I was wondering if it is related to his operation and general well being. He is 75 years old, and still working. He takes Warfarin and Atacan and many other tablets. His INR was 3 two days ago so his medication was altered to bring it back to 2.5. Should I take him to a hospital or is this not a serious symptom??? Please advise.","Doctor":"Hello and Welcome to ‘Ask A Doctor’ service. I have reviewed your query and here is my advice.

My only symptom was fever, and it was mostly at night. The fever was accompanied with nigh sweating and chills. If I take a paracetamol, in 1 hour I was normal. I also had weight loss and lack of appetite.The doctor took a lot of blood tests on me for different fevers like typhoid, malaria etc and everything came negative. Finally in an echo cardiogram, I was found to have very minimal pericardial effusion. So the doctor took that for granted and gave me a narrow spectrum antibiotic as iv (intravenous therapy) and my fever went down. But the fever reappeared again in 5 days. This time when I got admitted, the doctor found some problem in the chest X-Ray and asked for a chest CT-scan. I did that, and he found swollen lymph nodes, characteristic of tuberculosis.So now he started taking tests for TB. The TB gold, mantoux and AFB.The TB gold came mostly negative, the mantoux came positive (and I have a scar on my arm even now) and the AFB smear came negative. But looking at the mantoux and the CT scan, the doctor said that I have TB of lymph nodes and started treatment (INH, PZA and RMP). My fever was gone again and I was back to normal. The main thing was that I got my appetite back. I never felt hungry before I started TB medicine.Now, my fever reappeared again after 7 days. Also this time, I have a swelling on me left neck. The doctor said that the swelling could be tonsillitis and gave me an antibiotic for 3 days. But my fever kept increasing and now it reached 104 F again with chills at times. I had an ultrasonography done today and everything was normal and no enlarged lymph node was found near my abdomen, kidney etc. I also got a complete blood count test done today. My ESR is 15 (relatively low), CRP is 20 mg/l (high) and my haemoglobin is 12.7. Total count is 4300 cumm (normal), and platelet count is 2.5 lakh cumm. Doctor was saying that having a low ESR is a good thing, as it is too low for a dangerous disease.My current symptoms are high fever, slight chest pain very rarely. I will be getting a biopsy done of my neck this Monday probably and I will tell you what they say.So tell me what are chances of my disease being tuberculosis as I got a relapse and what are the procedures I should take to find out my disease.Thanks in advance.Additional DetailsAnd i had a blood test done today.

Papaqako answering your question.Thank you for posting your concern to HCM.Most people get infected by accidentally swallowing pinworm eggs. Anyone can get pinworms, but they are most common in school-aged children. The pinworms eggs stick to things the child touches, such as clothing, dishes, toys, and furniture. The eggs can live 2 to 3 weeks outside the body.Pinworms spread easily in homes, day care centers, schools, and other places where groups of people spend time together. So if one person in your family has pinworms, others probably do too.Treatment can help keep you from getting infected again and from spreading the infection to other people.To reduce your chances of spreading the infection or getting infected again:--Wash your hands carefully and often. --Keep your fingernails short, and don't scratch the itch.--Bath or shower every day.--Don't share or reuse towels or washcloths.--Wash clothes, bedding, and towels regularly.--Change your underwear and bedding each morning.If anyone in your household gets pinworms again, the whole family may need to take medicine.Hope this helps.Take care."},{"Patient":"i am a 30 years old guy.i am suffering from fungus infections on my fingers of my legs from last 10 years.i have taken lots of treatment regarding this but no benifit is there.from last 1-2 year i am also suffering from little bit headche always n my all physic are tired always.not getting proper sleep too.have problem in taking breaths also when on bed","Doctor":"Hello there.I m Dr.Milan infectious disease specialist.Before goin for any antifungal treatment we need to know which type of fungal agent is responcible for yr complain.

I am Dr.Aliem, and I am pleased to answer your query.Fungal infection in the body, especially in groins, is a fairly common skin condition, especially among youngsters. It just goes off with the application of certain anti-fungal ointments or medicated powder. Whitfield's ointment is a time tested remedy for this. It is availabe in the pharmacy over the counter. But it causes the formation of a whitish layer over the applied area, which disappears in a short time. Better medications are available, please consult your physician or dermatologist. I have a few suggestions for you:1. Keep the area dry as far as possible. Especially, avoid getting wet with sweat.2. Keep the area cool.3. It spreads by contiguity. Avoid sharing clothes/undergarments.Fungal infection in mucosal areas, like mouth, may be indicative of some conditions which will suppress your immunity, like Diabetes. So please consult your physician, who will order some blood tests for you. If you have difficulty or pain on swallowing, an upper G.I endoscopy may be needed. Hope this helps. Feel free to send further queries if any. I wiil be glad to answer.Dr.Aliem"},{"Patient":"I am 17yrs old I weigh 130,never had amy problems on my genitals until now,I just got ringworms on my arms and legs.

I was in a long distance relationship with a female for a year already but had never met her. She has a huge problem with germs and ofcourse people getting tested for std’s. She was stern about this. I had led a very unhealthy sexual lifestyle as a young man. I was now 30 but I was afraid of my past, especially my teenage years. Still, I was sure I didn t have anything because I never had any symptoms. Anyways, I got tested for all STD’s right before I went to visit her but didn t get the results until I was already at her place and we had already done multiple sexual acts including intercourse. They called me and told me that I had HSV 2 on my genitals. I was floored. I was sure that someone in my recent past had knowingly given it to me. I was on suicide watch in my own mind. I was so depressed and I knew that it wasn t HIV but I also felt that it wasn t far behind. Infact, I was scared to death when I got the call and heard the doctor say the H and the V. All I thought about was them calling me to tell me that I had HIV but luckily it was only HSV but it didn t matter to me. I felt basically the same way as if they told me it was the other. I felt alone with no one to talk to. I tried to talk to the doctors & nurses on the phone at the health department but didn t feel a lot of sympathy. It was the same when I went to the pharmacy to pickup the meds. I just felt like no one cared and I was a scar on the world. Again, I was so angry at the recent partners I had before my current gf. However, after doing some research and looking at pics, I realized that I had HSV 2 for over a decade, dating back to when I was a teen that had unprotected sex with just about any female I met. It never crossed my mind that they bumps I would get once or twice a year on my penis was herpes or any std. I just always felt that my penis was rubbing against my boxers wrong or the zipper on my pants that caused a rash and it would go away in less than a week. It never dawned on me that It may have been something else but sure enough it was the virus. That gave me mixed feelings. One is that I wondered about all the people I may have infected in the past and 2 is that I felt some relief in knowing that this isn t new, that Ive had it for over a decade, but it never really affected my life in any way. I knew then that I could atleast live a normal life with it. I went on my meds. Acyclovier 2 capsules, 2 times per day. I told the Health department about all my past partners although I was scared. I knew I would want someone to do that for me. However, the problem was my current gf. She’s pretty 50/50 in that on one hand she’s the sweetest person you would ever meet. She has helped me so much and saved my life in so many ways. On the other hand she had a hard upbringing which makes her pretty cold & judgmental at times. I feared telling her for multiple reasons and couldn t bring myself to do it. I kept a close eye on her since she’s been open with me and would tell me if she ever had any kind of discomfort. She never seemed to get any symptoms. Meanwhile, Im taking my meds every single day faithfully. Combine that with already having it for 10 years, I was told that my disease was probably pretty dormant and chances of my effecting someone from now on were very low even with unprotected sex. Sure enough 3 more years have gone by. She’s had no symptoms, we see eachother a lot now and she became pregnant after being told she probably would never be able to have kids. I thought I couldn t either because of all the things I did when I was younger. I had so much unprotected sex and never pulled out and I never got anyone pregnant but somehow we found out and it seemed like a blessing. However, one huge problem came up. The doctor who put me on my meds told me I wold have to be on them for life but every January 1st, my prescription is stopped and I have to go see the doctor. I never wanted to do this and she had already said it was a life long thing anyways so she would always just give me a new prescription for the year without even seeing me. Again, its been 3 years since my diagnosis and I literally hadn t had one outbreak. Not even anything close. Then this past new year came and again my meds are stopped. I call to get them refilled but this time they tell me that the doctor is no longer with them and they have a new guy now who I must see before he refills them. I give in and go to see him. He says him and the previous doctor use to argue about the meds a lot because he feels that research has shown that you don t need to take meds every day the rest of your life. That just wait until you feel an outbreak coming on and then take some for a week. I told him that Im truly not comfortable with that. That Ive heard others that do it but it doesn t seem safe to me and I am use to taking this every day. He said I don t need it and I may never have one again after having HSV 2 for almost 15 years and being on meds nonstop for 3 years. He gives me some pills from the office if I ever need for an emergency and he writes me a new prescription just incase of the future but tells me to not take meds everyday. I give in. I was so scared and felt so weird but he was right as nothing happened. I went to see my girl again for the 1st time since I found out she was pregnant. She was now going on 6 months. It is June and I also have been off my meds for 6 months. Everything is lovely until one day I feel a tingle on my penis and here it comes. Everything happened so quick. I was out of state and forgot the meds at home. I was only suppose to be there 10 days and then go back home for a summer semester of school until I come back down in her 8th month where I will live with her permanently. The meds are home and its the weekend. Im not even sure if this is an outbreak since I hadn t had one in so long but I think it could be. It was usually a big area of sores but this time it was just like one or 2 sores. My girl wanted to have sex. I panicked so much. Even though we were always unprotected, I kept condoms on me just incase. Everything was happening so quick and I was scared to say NO and have her ask why. Then what would I say? I told her I wasn t feeling good but she wouldn t stop. I was so scared. I put a condom in my pocket with her not knowing but she grabbed me, pulled me close to her, and started performing oral sex on me. I didn t think she would do that. It threw me completely off. Everything was a mess. 1st off it hurt because of my sore, 2nd all I could do was think about me having an outbreak, 3rd I knew that I had read that chances are very very very very low of giving her HSV 2 from her performing oral sex on me. Normally I wouldn t ejaculate but this time I forced myself to just so we didn t have to have sex. Still, later she wanted some and I put a condom on without her knowing and had sex with her. Literally, the very next day she showed my a rash on the back of her hand that was itching and it looked exactly like the herpes blisters that I get on my penis except smaller. I was so confused but at the same time knew where it came from. We also had sex the previous 2 days unprotected but I didn t have open sores. It made me wonder a lot of things. I was always told that Herpes took atleast 2 days to show up so how can she get the signs just 12 hours later. Then I read that in some rare cases they do showup the next day. Then I wondered did I maybe give it to her the other previous 2 days? Was I shedding before I had sores and didn t know it? I was wondering how did she get it when I had a condom on? Is it because she grabbed my penis and went down on me? Everything I read said it was very low risk for that. Then I thought maybe I had rubbed my penis on her vagina or close enough to it. Maybe I touched my infection and put my hand between her legs but I couldn t remember. I thought maybe after intercourse, I took the condom off too soon to hide it from her and maybe some fluids got crossed over. I just didn t know. I was so upset. I hated my doctor for telling me to go off my meds. Even moreso I hated myself for not being man enough to tell her that I was having an outbreak. Why let her go down or me or have sex? I should ve thought of something quick? Im a lowlife piece of crap. That s how I felt. It just all happened so fast that I froze. What about her? What about my baby? How could I let this happen? Why did I stop taking my meds? Why didn t I leave on time? Oh yes, I got off track earlier in my story but I meant to say that I was only suppose to be there 10 days but I changed my flight and had it pushed back another week. Literally the very next day after I was suppose to go back is when I had an outbreak. I only stayed for her and it backfired because I gave her herpes but maybe I gave it to her a couple of days before that anyways? All of this was running through my head. I still didn t have the guts to tell her. I went and got more meds the next day. I was still having sex with her. Each time with a condom that she didnt know about. I pushed my flight back 2 more times and have been here for another 3 weeks. I was kinda happy for a sec because her hand bumps went away pretty quick but then it came right back again. At the same time she said she feels like she’s about to get a pimple on her lip. She said she can feel it coming. She told me to look and you can see it getting red. Sure enough it was but it never came. It went right away like her hand and never returned. Her hand came back though then it went away pretty quick again. Now it came back a 3rd time and this time she now also has it on her opposite wrist. I started to freakout. l I think my girl has a weak immune system and she’s not a fighter when it comes to things that itch. She cant help but to scratch it so I knew it would be hard to heal. I did a ton of research and had all these questions. I read that I cant give her hsv 1 if I only have hsv 2 so Im positive that s what she has. However, I wondered was it only on her hand & wrist but not her vagina since she had no symptoms there and I wore a condom? Everything I read said different things. I wondered could it be Herpetic Whitlow but those things seem like on the finger tips while her’s is on the back of her hand and on the wrist. I read about zolster but she’s already had chicken pox. I read that if its above the waist then its oral HSV 2. Then I read that its the genital one but it has spread. I was going crazy. I was hoping that maybe she got it somehow only on her hand/wrist and nowhere else. That its not on her genitals. I was trying to tell her that she needs to stop scratching and it seems contagious. I told her that its spreading but she kept scratching and had no relief. We were going to have sex again, she put her hand between her legs and I got upset at her and told her not do to that right now. I wasn t mean at all but more concerned and she said that she’s fine, its just a lil rash but it got worse. I read that you cant spread herpes to other parts after the initial infection but this is her 1st one so I was trying to get her to stop before she does it more & more. Yesterday she told me she has some bumps on the bottom of her belly and it looked a little like it but wasn t sure. Im just so scared. I hinted to her a few days ago that it maybe herpes but you can tell she didn t buy that. We tried Benadryl spray, alcohol, and others to stop the itching but nothing worked. She’s been showing her family the rash which was driving me crazy. I even got crazy enough to where the last couple of nights I put some of my acyclovir on ice cream or a donut and gave it to her without her knowing. After she started scratching so bad last night I finally confessed everything to her and she’s been an emotional wreck. We use to not get along a lot anyways because she has a bad attitude at times while Im a pretty laid back dude. Her mother is very all knowing and overprotective so we don t get along all the time either. I just knew everything was going to come to a head. My girl has gone back & forth from crying uncontrollably to then being violent and attacking me. She said I ruined her life. She said she would ve never been with me if she had known. She never talks about what happened a couple of weeks ago with the sores and me letting her go down on me. Instead she focuses about me knowing for 3 years and never telling her. She said she would ve never done that to me. She said no one is going to want her and she doesn t want to be with me again. She then breaks down thinking about our baby. She said that the baby is probably going to have it and even if she doesn t at birth, that she wont be able to touch her because she will be so scared of infecting her with her hand & wrist like that. She is so distraught. One time she says she doesn t even want the baby anymore but then she changes. She also got mad at me for giving her the meds since she might cant even take them when pregnant. Then she read about the 1st outbreak stuff late in pregnancy and she is going crazy. I told her that everything she is saying is right. I feel like Im the worst person on earth. I take full blame. I do at times get so upset at that doctor for taking me off the meds but I say that if I didn t let her go down on me that night or would ve just not had sex when I saw the sore then the doctor still may have been right and I wouldn t have passed it on so its all my fault but maybe I was shedding before then and gave it to her anyways. She still brings up the 3 years thing but I told her that I didn t find out until after we had already had intercourse and by that time I felt like you either already would have it or Im on the meds now so she wouldn t get it. She had test she thinks for herpes when she got pregnant and came back negative. I was so happy at that time and thanked god because it had bothered me for years but now I went and screwed it up right after that anyways at the worst possible time. Right when she’s pregnant. I feel so bad. I wish I could have it all back. The 3 years. The 3 weeks. People are so scared to say anything but then they end up having to say something anyways when its 10x worse because you have now infected them which is the one thing you wanted to avoid and could ve avoided if you would ve told them sooner. If she had known then it would ve been her decision. That s what she keeps telling me. I decided her life for her and its not fair. She is so right and everything she feels now is how I felt when I got diagnosed. I told her I already went through that but its not a death sentence and it really doesn t change anything in your life but you can tell that she doesn t want to hear that from me of all people. Im the one guy she doesn t want to hear it from. I don t think we will get through this. I will never forgive myself. Im a great person and Im of age now at 34 yet I managed to do something so selfish, so immature, and so repugnant to someone who loves me so much. Can someone please help me atleast by answering some of the following questions: 1-Did I definitely give her hsv 2 and nothing else? 2-Is it possible that she only has it on her hand/wrist and not her genitals or does it still mean that it definitely started In the genitals? 3-is it possible that its oral hsv2 and not genital? 4-if its went away and came back multiple times in a short span, does that mean its still the 1st outbreak or are these already reoccurring? I just want to make sure that its done spreading so her antibodies can build up and she has no risk of getting it anywhere else, especially the genitals 5-Is all herpes dangerous for your baby during pregnancy or is it strictly if you are having a vaginal outbreak at the time of birth? I keep hearing mixed things on this? Like is my baby still at risk if its only on her hands/wrist and or oral? 6-if it doesn t spread anymore during this outbreak and its not on her vagina, does that mean it will be impossible for her to get it on her vagina in the future since she will have built up the antibodies? 7-Ive heard some say that when you have hsv2 in areas like your hand that its less likely to reoccur or atleast reoccur often while others have said that it will happen more often than the normal kind. Do you know? 8-I use to hear that if you take the meds every day like you are suppose to then chances of you infecting someone even with unprotected sex is very low but it seems like on here that you guys still sound like its 50/50 if you are taking meds every day. 9-It seems like her blisters maybe really contagious and even I feel like Im about to get rashes in some areas but then they never come. Is it possible that she has some kind of herpes that I still can get in other spots or is it just trying to maybe do stuff to me but my antibodies wont let it? 10-will a vaginal hsv2 outbreak always hurt and if she does have it on her hands/wrist with painful itching and scratching, would she also get that same itch on her vagina if she had it down there? Again, she hasn t had any symptoms down there and Im hoping she doesn t. 11- Can she transfer it to her eyes? She s been messing with her eyes alot. Some of it maybe allergies but Im still scared that she is spreading it to them. All of this was very long and Im sure there will be some things later that I wish I would ve added but atleast I hope I get some answers. She will be going to the doctor soon to get all the answers even though she wants me out of her life now. Her mother will know soon which will be hell to deal with but I deserve it all. Thanks for the help either way","Doctor":"Hello,Welcome to HCM,Herpes is a localized infection and it can certainly be transmitted by close physical contact.Condoms provide only partial protection against transmission because they cover only the shaft of the penis and don't cover the base of the penis and pubic region.Therefore a herpes lesion e.g on the base of penile shaft or pubic region can still be transmitted between sexual partners due to direct contact during sex.Once daily valacyclovir reduces the rate of viral replication and also clinical herpes and therefore makes the person less infectious or less likely to give herpes to sexual partner.However the risk is not completely zero even with valacyclovir.Currently there is no other method such as you mention e.g spray, that can reduce risk of transmission.As a precaution you must avoid sexual contact during clinical episodes when there is a high risk of transmitting the virus.A condom does reduce the risk as does Valacyclovir, but they don't make it to Zero.Thank you."},{"Patient":"Hi, I got bit by 3 wasps 2 days ago, nearly 3 days now.

I am carrier of Hepatitis B. {Silent}. For the last many a years mouth ulcers were developing on my interior lips & tongue occasionally but for the last a few months the mouth ulcers in numbers at a time have occurred frequently thus resulting in  intolerable pain though I did apply Candid & other connected Zels but with no fruitful results. I am at loss to know that why these mouth ulcers are developing frequently & in this connection I request you to advise me what necessary measures I shall adopt to get relief from this problem & no further mouth ulcers may occur.","Doctor":"HiThank you for asking HCMI have gone through your query. As you having IBS which can leads to B complex vitamin deficiencies which further can leads to mouth ulcers. Taking vitamin B complex supplements will be helpful in such case also. Other conditions like herpes virus should be checked also which also can give such clinical picture. In case of positive results antiviral therapy helps also. IBS should be managed properly. A consultation with a gastroenterologist and colonoscopy examination will be helpful in treating this. Drugs like mesalazine is helpful in controlling IBS in many patients. Also avoid food and drink which stimulates your IBS.Hope this may help you.

It turns out that during my initial test the doctor saw something near the end of the test but ironically i found out the next day that i had the stomach flue and was exausted during the initial test. anyway, my question is after the second test today it went well reached my 85% max heart rate and went for the scans with isotope. The technician would not comment on the results so i didnt push it. he did mention that i should keep a log of the tests i take so they dont get repeated in the future for no reason. I dont know how to take that comment. Am i being paranoid or what? i have to wait three weeks for the results. I dont even know if i should perform my normal work or other exercise?","Doctor":"Technicians are not supposed to report any results. It requires a physician trained and skilled in reading them to do that, so that is why he didn't tell you.  He may just have been trying to be helpful with his comment. There are several different types of stress tests, so keeping track of what you had is a good idea. If you go to another doctor or the Emergency Room with problems that seem related to your heart, it would be valuable information to know what tests you've already had and their results. This way some potential conditions could be ruled out without further testing, and studies for the correct diagnosis properly initiated. I think you are being a little \\"paranoid\\" as a result of the technician's response. As far as your normal work and exercise, if the doctor ordering the tests didn't say anything, you are most likely fine to pursue your regular activities. You can always check with him or her to be absolutely sure.

I have a incomplete spinal cord injury.. neurogenic bladder and bowel as well as all the other perks of an Sci.. just wondering if the issues I'm having are related to post intubation or due to me not being very mobile. I walk with a walker. I'm also suffering from low blood pressure my husband who is a nurse takes it a few times a day and it's usually 80/40 and this is on midodrine which I take tid","Doctor":"Your low blood pressure and productive cough need to be evaluated promptly. I would be concerned about a pneumonia or severe bronchitis. This could be related to your limited immobility. A bad infection like pneumonia can also result in low blood pressure. You don't mention how much your breathing was affected by the injury, but I would be concerned that you have not been able to take deep enough breaths to keep your lungs well aerated. This could lead to pneumonia. So I recommend you go to the Emergency Room and be examined for these possibilities.

He has recommended a CT scan which is due tomorrow.  Doctor was saying that such high ESR is only associated with cancer.  Is it not possible that this high ESR is due to Typhoid or  Pneumonia? He does not have any cough, diarrhea or vomiting - just constact 102F temperature.","Doctor":"ESR is a nonspecific test which is associated with a variety of conditions, including infections, inflammation, cancers, collagen vascular diseases (eg, lupus, vasculitis, rheumatoid arthritis). It can be very high particularly with a condition called temporal arteritis or polymyalgia rheumatic, or with severe infections, so you really can't say it's just cancer. Fevers and high sed rate could be seen with any of the conditions I mentioned. Certainly infections could include pneumonia and typhoid. Since he has an abnormal chest x-ray, I think it is wise to proceed with the CT scan. I would also be considering the possibility of tuberculosis.

This requires a different treatment than chlamydia. It is best to go back to the clinic, get it evaluated, and confirm the diagnosis. The azithromycin most likely has worked, but you may have developed this secondary infection as a side effect. You also want to be sure you don't have another STD which wasn't initially detected.

No need to have regular urine tests to detect the recurrence of infection.Maintain a good hygiene surrounding the private parts.3.

Nothing to worry.As such the amount of active chemotherapeutic agent excreted in the urine of a patient receiving treatment may not be sufficient to cause the harmful effects if it comes in contact with the attendant. Further most of the chemo agents get metabolized into inactive substances which are rendered harmless and excreted out through the urine.

Diagnosis can be confirmed by ultrasound .While as you mentioned that there is low grade fever , nausea , lower abdominal pain , so may be due to these reasons.1 Salpingitis i.e. infection of right fallopian tube may be the reason of such fever . Diagnosis can be confirmed by ultrasound as well physical examination by a gynaecologist.2 Right renal calculus or urinary tract infection may be the another cause of such symptoms .As you mentioned in the query that often there are urinary tract infection present , so get in urine culture and drug sensitivity test . After culture take proper antibiotics as prescribed by doctor.3 Typhoid fever may be the another reason of such fever . Get in Widal test as well serology test for confirmation . Typhoid fever is an intestinal fever , so pain may be due to typhoid .Deal as mentioned above ."},{"Patient":"My first love, boyfriend just got treated for chlamydia yesterday..

This because it is not an antifungal medication like Tolnaftate is. So I would not recommend using metronidalzole in your case.I would also recommend to treat your athlete's foot, since it may spread in other areas of the body, or to other people if it is let untreated. I sorry to say that sometimes it requires indeed a long time to get healed especially if factors like humidity in the feet, continues to be present.If I was your caring doctor I would recommend:1) keep the area clean and dry, as much as possible2) use absorbent socks like cotton that wick water away from your feet and don't use occlusive shoe materials, such as vinyl, cause the feet to remain moist, providing an excellent area for the fungus to breed.3) A homemade remedy of dilute white vinegar soaks, using one part vinegar and roughly four parts water, once or twice a day as 10-minute foot soaks may aid in treatment.4) Powders, especially medicated powders (such as with miconazole [Lotrimin] or tolnaftate [Tinactin]) may help too.5) Many medications are available, including miconazole, econazole nitrate (Spectazole), clotrimazole (Lotrimin), terbinafine (Lamisil) sprays and creams, and ketoconazole shampoo and cream (Nizoral), etc. Treatment for athlete's foot should generally be continued for four weeks or at least one week after all of the skin symptoms have cleared.Hope this helps,Take care."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor my mother had undergone a urine culture and sensitivity test.e.coli was detected ,but the report by diagnostic states ciprofloxacin as both sensitive as well as resistive , is this report correct?my doctor as prescribed ciprofloxacin, is right?my name is ahmed","Doctor":"Hello, AhmedThank you for posting your question to HCMThis is Dr. Papaqako answering to you.Yes, Ciprofloxacin works very well against e.coli. Even if it isn't fully sensitive, it still should clear the infection, as cipro is one of the medications we recommend in case of resistant e.coli.Your mother should take it like the doctor has recommended (250-500mg, 2 times/day, for 3-5 days, depending on the severity of the infection).Tell her to make sure to drink plenty of water, because it helps the urinary bladder to evacuate more often.Hope this helps.If you have any other question, feel free to ask.Regards."},{"Patient":"Hello Doctor, I have these pinkish/reddish blotches on both of my inner thighs, and they've been there quite sometime.

I ve done the research referring to WWW.WWWW.WW This particular page relates untreated sleep apnea to hypertension and I believe, I ve had sleep apnea for years that has gone undiagnosed because of these facts; - I was diagnosed with hypogonadism in 2000, which I ve been being prescribed Testosterone Replacement Therapy since 2000, as well. - The testosterone injections has caused me to gain a lot of weight. I was 160 lbs before I began treatment for my hypogonadism and throughout the years, I have continuously gained weight to where my weight is at 280 on average. IAW my medical records, my doctors state that I have high hips, making my waistline an easy 40 inches plus on average. - I was being prescribed 400 mg/ 2 weeks for 10 years before my doctors decided I was taking too much and decided to lower my dosage to 200 mg/2 weeks. - During treatment on TRT, I ve had a heart attack, been diagnosed with insomnia, depression, PTSD, sleep apnea, CHF, Hypertension and Dilated Cardiomyopathy, amongst just a few of my conditions. - I am still being treated for all of these conditions & I wear a CPAP when I sleep at night. *My question is, can I have a doctor type a statement relating my sleep apnea to my hypertension? I am requesting this for VA Compensation Benefits. I feel that the VA Hospital works hand in hand with the VA Regional Office, so its hard to get any of my requests met without feeling like I m asking them to go out of their way to assist me.","Doctor":"Hi, No. Doctor can give you this statement, as there is no relation between hypertension and sleep apnea which you have.

Use of vasoline can coat and protect your lips. If you are recovering from any respiratory infection, this can be transferred by your salvia. This is common with strep.

Any dental concerns such as grinding your teeth or mouth breathing? This can dry your lips and throat. Are there any other oral symptoms such as a coated tongue or red tissue that can indicate a fungal infection? This can require a prescription such as Nystatin. Probiotics or Acidophilus can help reduce chances of infection. Other medications can produce side effects and your medical history should be reviewed. Seasonal changes such as dealing with dry heat can cause tissue reaction, chapped lips and dehydration. Drink water and more water to be sure to be well hydrated.

I have reviewed your query and here is my advice. I passed carefully through your question and would explain that there are many drugs which can help reduce your triglyceride levels.

For this, it is important to know: - if the bed of toe nails are red, swollen and with pus coming out, then, you might need to apply antibiotic cream at the nail bed- if the bed is not affected, but only the toe nail, then, I advise to:wash with warm water and saltapply gentian violet solution on the nail and on the surrounding soft tissue apply anti fungal cream locally.

The doctors don t seem to have an answer for the cause. Since I have had health issues years back where the physician at the time thought that I have something that goes in and out of remission (which he thought was indicative of lupus -- test came back negative even though I had the butterfly rash) -- How do I find out what to do now?","Doctor":"Hi, 1. Having bacteria found in your urine testing is indicative for Urinary tract infection (UTI). Antibiotics you were prescribed are the best choice to treat UTI. 2. Having loose stool might be partially related to antibiotics use. I advise to use probiotics and increase water intake. 3. The presence of sporadic blood in stool is indicative for possible laceration of rectal mucosa :- colonoscopy to exclude hemorrhoids and ulceration of bowel mucosa- run fecal occult blood to exclude GI bleeding4. Ischemic colitis is inflammation of colon due to reduction of blood flow in narrowed blood vessels. It is not caused by bacterial or other types of infection. If ischemic colitis was determined, then, I highly advise to discuss with GI specialist to :- find out what is causing narrowing of arteries?- determine the best treatment. For the moment, I advise to:- increase fluids intake to keep well hydrated- continue taking antibiotics as prescribed- discuss with your physician about the medications that would aggravate the narrowing of arteriesHope it was of help!Dr.Albana"},{"Patient":"Sweating at night, smells like vinegar.

The cyst would flair up every couple months resulting in extreme pain and then, as the pain peaked, the cyst would rupture, drain, and disappear leaving only a small red scab. At first I ignored the cyst and assumed it would disappear by itself after rupturing. Unfortunately, the cyst flared up again like clockwork every couple months and drained itself each time. Finally, the cyst flared up again and I finally went to my family doctor for a remedy. He referred me to a surgeon who suggested surgical removal. During the surgery, he removed the cyst while I was under general anesthesia. After the surgery I had mild pain for two weeks followed by little to no pain during the third week. The same week I saw my surgeon for a check up and told him I was not feeling any pain. He said this was fantastic and suggested we remove my stitches. I agreed. He then proceeded to carry out the most painful removal of stitches I had ever experienced! It was excruciating! Throughout the process I yelped, screamed, and squirmed. Afterwards, I had mild soreness, pain, and bleeding for about a day before the pain completely subsided again and I felt 100%. Today my wife asked to examine my wound to make sure it was healing and was shocked to see a lone stitch sticking straight out of the edge of the wound. She took a picture and showed me. There is a blue stitch sticking out of the edge of my wound site, the wound site appears surprisingly red and open, and, worst of all, there is what appears to be a small white object no thicker than a rubberband and no bigger than 2-3 cm curled in my wound site. It appears that it could just be another stitch, but when we looked at the wound immediately after surgery all the stitches were dark blue. Is this an object he used to close the wound, drain the wound, or promote healing in the wound site OR did I somehow become infected with some kind of worm or parasite?!?

Regarding your concern, I would explain that your symptoms could be related to an inner ear disorder or a possible TIA (transient ischemic attack). For this reason, I recommend consulting with your attending physician for a physical exam and some tests: -a resting ECG and a cardiac ultrasound - a Doppler ultrasound of the carotid arteries for possible narrowing - blood electrolytes - complete blood count. Consulting with an ENT specialist may be needed if all the above tests result normal. I would also recommend performing a brain MRI, just to be sure that everything is OK.

The concern is not so much the blood pressure but the great increase in pulse. 99.4 is a borderline fever so also not so great a concern. If he has been having flu like symptoms and not eating or drinking enough fluids, he could be very dehydrated. This could cause him to get very nauseous if he stood up and would cause the pulse to go way up. A bleeding ulcer could also cause nausea and an increased pulse. If there is any possibility of this, it might be best he is seen by a doctor. You don't mention specifically what the flu-like symptoms are, and they could be indicative of several different conditions. If he has had a lot of diarrhea, this can also cause dehydration. This could be from an intestinal infection. In any case, if you are concerned, have him seen. At the least, if he is dehydrated, they can give him some IV fluids and he can feel better.

You might have a blood infection that can progress quickly into shock if not treated. With the fevers, dry heaves, probable dehydration, and decreased food/fluid intake, your diabetes is likely out of control and you could be getting ketotic.

Your symptoms are consistent with a variety of gastrointestinal infections. The only way to find out exactly what the cause is, is to see a doctor and have the diarrhea tested for amoebas and other types of infections. The treatments for these different conditions vary, so it is important to find the correct diagnosis before you treat it. There are specific antibiotics for bacterial infection, and different medications for the different parasites that may be present. Viral infections are managed symptomatically.

There is no concern about shingles getting into the incision. Shingles is caused by a virus that has been in your body for many years. It can erupt in a rash following a stressful event, which would include the surgery.I would be concerned about other types of infection, however, which might require antibiotics, and could potentially get into the wound.

I don't see anything like a sliver, but I mentioned it to my dog's vet and he thought I should have it looked at because knuckles are serious places for infection to get started.","Doctor":"Your vet is correct. My first thought is you have gotten an infection. These can be particularly problematic when in joints like the knuckle as damage to the joint from the infection may lead to disability using the hand. The injury you had from the buried rose limb is like getting an injection of dirt directly into the knuckle, so this can cause a nasty infection. It's important to get this looked at and treated immediately. You might even need surgery to clear the infection and prevent damage to the joint.

And very tired all I do is sleep and barely eat.","Doctor":"Were you prescribed antibiotics for the pneumonia? If it's been a week, you shouldn't be getting worse. You might need a different antibiotic for this particular bacteria. I am especially concerned about the spontaneous bruises. This could indicate a problem with low platelets in the blood (platelets help the blood clot when bleeding occurs), which can be caused by some infections and also some types of medicines.The weight loss, extreme fatigue, and loss of appetite are also of concern. The pneumonia, if it is severe enough, could affect your oxygen levels and this could have serious effects.I recommend you go to emergency and be evaluated for these possibilities. It sounds bad enough that you might even need to be in the hospital awhile and get antibiotics IV. Hope this helps."},{"Patient":"In 2013 and 1 yr later, in 2014, I had a TIA.

In case of TIA Aspirin is the best medicine, it is the alone is enough for that, still the underlying cause of TIA would be matter of concern Aspirin can only prevent the further even but not for sure, some time the TIA might not be due to disturbances in hemodynamic system but it could be due to other etiology.

I plan on taking Musinex DM and Delsym couph syrup tonight so I can sleep. Last night I was up coughing so badly all night, my ribs ache me today. Is it safe for me to combine those 2 medications?","Doctor":"If you are mixing Mucinex DM with Delsym you will be taking an excess dose of dextromethorphan, the cough suppressant component. If you get plain Mucinex, you could take it with Delsym. Check the labels of the medicines to be sure you aren't getting similar components in each drug. Many OTC meds have a combination of several different drugs in them, so you want to be sure there is no overlap if you are taking more than 1 OTC med.

I m a diabetic (2) and I just want to know if Ceftin is a good antibiotic for this illness.. and how long will it take before I should feel better?","Doctor":"Sepsis is a bacterial infection in the blood. It often starts in the urinary tract. It can be caused by many different types of bacteria. The correct antibiotic to cure it depends on the type of bacteria you have. Since you were in the hospital, they did tests to diagnose the type of bacteria and to see what antibiotics it is susceptible to. In that case, you would initially be treated with IV antibiotics, and when the infection was under control, you would be switched to oral antibiotics. Typically, the oral antibiotics would be the same or similar to the IV ones were, so the Ceftin should be a good antibiotic in your case. You can have residual effects after such a serious illness for some days or weeks afterward. You should also be keeping a close eye on your diabetes control as sepsis could upset it and poorly controlled diabetes also reduces your immunity.

Can tinea cause mrsa? I never borrow razors or towels etc or make contact with others but it seems I caught something weird at the local swimming pool.  I got a severe form of athletes feet about four months ago (tried ALL over the counter meds (6or7 from local pharmacy) as well as vinegar foot baths and tea tree oil, taking vitamin c and astragulas. My hand got a bit itchy once - probably from touching my feet when applying medicine. then a mrsa like pus filled boil developed there on my hand . Then the fungus itch spread to the groin area. Then two mrsa like boils appeared above the groin but below the belly button - one in an old scar and another boil five inches away. They made bumps and oozed pus and the skin became pink in a wide circle. The jock itch eventually receded using a regiment of over the counter anti fungal and vinegar and oregano washes and the boils went away afterwards with constant application of mecuraclear (Benzalkonium Chloride) oregano oil and manurka honey, but left red marks on both my hand and groin area. The athletes foot is still with me but is almost gone - and no longer itches but hurts a bit and has small craters between my toes but the skin gashes seem to be getting smaller - hurts but no longer itches. Recently after applying medicine to my feet with my fingers I accidentelly touched my kneecap with my finger. Weird but then very shortly afterwards a mrsa like boil appeared there (I still have it) but no itching occured. It is a red sore lump on my kneecap that ocassionally creates a pustule - the skin is red around it for a diameter of about three and a half inches and the muscle near it going up my thigh is sore.

Maintain the optimum hydration by applying perrolleum jelly it is also help full to you.Maintain the cleanliness as it is equally important in maintaining infection and so rash.Wearing a cotton garments seems to be help ful in some people.I will be happy to answer your further concern on bit.ly/DrArun.Thank you,Dr Arun TankInfectious diseases specialist,HCM."},{"Patient":"A bug is going around here where I live, my son had it then I got it, and lots of others have had it.

I had a biopsy done and they decided it wasn't bad enough to treat. They told me to come back in 6 months to see if the HPV had gone away. I've been with the same guy for the past 3 years and we haven't been sexually active in 6 months. I know that the guy carries HPV and gives it to the girl in most cases. How do I ever get rid of it? Looks like if he carries it, he will just continue to give it back to me. Also, I have no sex drive at all. I am only 21 years old. I'm unsure of what to do about it or why this is happening.

Someone has mentioned to me that this may have been agrovated by taking omeprazole which i have been taking for a few years now for acid reflux.

Since omeprazole is a strong acid reducing agent we prescribe it only for small durations. If you are having it over extended periods then the stomach does not produce adequate acid that can neutralise bacteria. Hence you have a higher predisposition for infections.

I am 30 now.","Doctor":"HelloAs you stated in you query that your doctor advised benzathine penicillin or penidure 12 lac unit at the age of 16 years till 40 years . Now you are only 30 years and stopped the injection . In my opinion,you should take these injections for up to 40 years age as these injection are most suitable for streptococcus infection , which is main cause of rheumatic disease.Now about these symptoms as you mention may be due to some bronchoconstriction caused by some allergy or due to other infection  .So take some  montelukast+bambuterol tablet ,once in day .Also take some cough syrup like dextromethorphan + ammonium chloride+chlorpheniramine .Since these are prescription drugs , so consult your treating doctor and get his opinion.Once again for penidure , consult your treating physician and get his opinion regarding stopping of drugs.Good luck."},{"Patient":"Dear Doctor,I had typhoid fever last November and was taken to hospital. I stayed there for 4 days and I was given Cefadroxil oral alongside Sucralfate and Omeprazole. I also had Dexamethasone which was injected through infusion. Now 2 months later I have that disease again but this time I decided to just stay at home and get total rest. The doctor prescribed me Levaquin once a day alongside Omeprazole and Vitamins. I have been taking this meds for 7 days now yet I still feel dizzy. Is this a sign of recovery or should I undergo another blood test result and stay in the hospital? For the information, I have no fever occured. Thanks.","Doctor":"Hello and Welcome to ‘Ask A Doctor’ service.I have reviewed your query and here is my advice. You are having typhoid fever, for which at least, in this condition there is no need for any hospital admission.Now your doctor advised you levofloxacin, omeprazole, and multivitamins. The drug of choice is ciprofloxacin 500 mg twice in a day for 14 days. While another alternative treatment is ceftriaxone 2 gm per day for 7 days. So, dizziness may be due to hyperacidity (gastritis ) produced by levaquin.In my opinion get in blood for Widal test as well as serology test and consult a physician for the second opinion and take treatment. Since this is a prescription medicine so consultation with a physician is important.Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further.Regards,Dr. Het Ram Bishnoi"},{"Patient":"Hi doctors, I have a question.

I also had blood in my stool a few days ago. I don t know if these two things are connected or not. Any ideas on what this could be?","Doctor":"From the problems listed in your question you had chronic urinary tract infection for which you were treated with antibiotics for 10 days and the symptoms also subsided. The white stuff ( actually crystals ) seen in the urine and feces are due to the antibiotic used most probably sulfonamides. These white stuff will disappear upon discontinuance of the said antibiotics. Take a lot of oral fluids to maintain a good urine output so as to fasten the elimination of those white stuff.

The natural course of a VSD depends to a large degree on the size of the defect. A significant number (30–50%) of small defects close spontaneously, most frequently during the 1st 2 yr of life. Small muscular VSDs are more likely to close (up to 80%) than membranous VSDs are (up to 35%).

Just try to relax and avoid physical activity. A cup of lemon juice would help too. Single spikes in blood pressure values are not indicative of uncontrolled high blood pressure values. They could be related to physical activity or anxiety. If these blood pressure values become more frequent, I would recommend consulting with your attending physician for a physical exam and some blood lab tests in order to investigate for the possible causes underlying high blood pressure.

An abdominal MRI may be needed. Hope you will find this answer helpful! Kind regards, Dr. Iliri"},{"Patient":"I use Symbicort everyday.

The doctor put three stiches in.I was not given much information on how to care for the wound, only to come back to the hospital 10 days later for stitch removal.  I was curious how long i should leave the bandage on, whether i should be applying any ointments or creams, abd when i should have the stiches removed. I was under the impression that facial stiches were typically removed about 5 days after placement, not ten.  I was given two medicines both oral- cefixime tablets 0.1g, taken twice daily and some sort of chinese medicine (translated roughly as \\"Dragon's blood pills with enteric coating\\" 龙血竭肠溶衣- im not expecting any advice here about that).  Do you have any advice for me regarding wound treatment and when to have the cut looked at again or to have the stiches removed.  I am obviously concerned about the wound healing but also doing everything I can to prevent an unsightly scar from forming since it is in such a noticeable location on my face.Thank you for any advice.","Doctor":"welcome.do not worry. this is not a big problem.you are right.stches are removed after 5 to 7 days , on face  in general.why was you   told 10 days I also could not understand.dressing is required for 2 to 3 days.after that you can apply betadine locally.any query ,ask again.we are here to serve you.feedback."},{"Patient":"Hello Doctor, an enquiry re: ARS symptoms.

You shouldn't take antibiotics with out any prescription from a doctor. It can do more harm than good. Bloating you have is most likely due to  dysbacteriosis after antibiotic therapy. For sinusitis not always antibiotics is needed. Nasal decongesants like phenylephrine or local decongesants like oxymetazoline, NSAID like nimusulide and antihistamine like cetirizine will be helpful. But in case of moderate to severe infection antibiotics can be used judiciously according to need. Omnicef is cefdinir which is quite strong antibiotic. If there is no improvement even after decongesants and antibiotics then x ray of paranasal sinus should be done and puncture and drainage of sinus will be needed in some case.

Eating a diet rich in protein, Taking plenty of fresh fruits and also a multivitamin. Also some source of simple sugars like juices or tang or bananas also helps. Avoid caffeine based drinks like colas or coffee. In your case since you have swollen legs do get your Hb levels tested and also an ECG.

I was very ill for almost two months, sometimes in bed for a day or two, here and there and always itchy with lesions on the right side of my lower spine...not so much pain, but itchy. I also had hives. I was weak and fatigued, had headaches, low grade fever and chills and lost 15 lbs. Around Halloween I began to feel a little stronger, the hives were gone and it still took a couple of wks. to begin to feel normal again. I began to gain some of the weight back. Last week I got two small lesions under my nostrils and yesterday I was in bed most of the day with low grade fever and chills again. Does shingles reoccur or does it have more to do with the autoimmune disease? Will I have to be sick for two months again? I moved here from Iowa and do not have a doctor who treats this disease. I have seen a Pulmonologist.","Doctor":"Hello,This is Dr. Papaqako answering your question.Shingles occurs when the virus that causes chickenpox starts up again in your body. After you get better from chickenpox, the virus \\"sleeps\\" in your nerve roots. In some people, it stays sleeps forever. In others, the virus \\"wakes up\\" when disease, stress, or aging weakens the immune system. Most people who get shingles will get better and will not get it again. But it is possible to get shingles more than once.If you have shingles, symptoms happen in stages. At first you may have a headache or be sensitive to light. You may also feel like you have the flu but not have a fever.Later, you may feel itching, tingling, or pain in a certain area. That's where a band, strip, or small area of rash may occur a few days later.I don't think the fever is connected with shingles, but it may be another virus, that because of low immunity have reactivated a simple Herpes lesion. That because the time difference between the lesions and fever is large.Treat it as a common cold. But if in 3-5 days, is not getting better, or is worse, then I would recommend to see a doctor.Hope this helps, Take care."},{"Patient":"i have a little bump on my back and every time i squeeze it it is full of puss and it wont stop coming out, it doesn't show like a white head spot it's just a tiny lump but every sinlg etime i squeeze puss comes out, just wondering if it's an infection or what","Doctor":"Hello,This is Dr. Papaqako answering your question.Yes, it is an infection of the hair follicle. I would recommend to not squeeze it, but help the process of draining only if it starts coming out by itself. When you squeeze it before it is ready, a part of the pus goes deeper, by spreading more in the tissues around. Also, the body has the capacity to organize, evacuate, and absorb the rest that remains inside, if its a small amount.If it gets bigger, starts hurting a lot, and you start feeling fever, it may need to get drained by a simple procedure that makes a cut in its surface. You need to see a doctor to reevaluate the need of it, and do it if necessary. hope this helps,Take care."},{"Patient":"Hi. My mother in law is coming back to the United States from Cambodia.

That floaty feeling often comes with a viral infection. Antibiotics do not treat viruses, you have to give your body time to get rid of the virus.

In a majority of cases an I&D or Incision and drainage is a fairly routine procedure with no complications. So I would urge you to go to a good hospital and have it incised under sterile conditions and local anesthesia. The reason is that even though Staphylococcal infections seem innocuous some of them are resistant and do not resolve on their own.

I am not diabetic, and had a break out of what I now believe to have been shingles, about 3yrs. ago.I am now 43, and I also had chicken pox when I was 18.","Doctor":"Hello dear,Thank you for your contact to health care magic.I read and understand your concern. I am Dr Arun Tank answering your concern.No, shingles never causes anaesthesia or numbness.It can causes paresthesia, means altered sensation like burning, tingling etc. All this symptoms always be associated with the pain, which is hall mark of shingles.I advice you to please get your complete examination done as it is very initial symptoms of big things.Numbness has wide etiology for its occurrence. So once the cause is known treatment should be guided on that direction.I advice you to wear a soft footwear other wise the numb area get ulcers. Once formed the ulcer will be very difficult to heal in such a area.Please maintain the good hygieneic atmosphere around the toes as it can prevent the future infection.Please take vitamin B complex tablets under doctors guidance until you visit the concerned specialist.I will be happy to answer your further concern on bit.ly/DrArun.Thank you,Dr Arun TankInfectious diseases specialist,HCM."}]`),q={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:x},data(){return{searchQuery:"",visibleCount:6,poemsData:M,isLoading:!1}},computed:{filteredPoems(){return this.searchQuery.trim()?this.poemsData.filter(a=>{const e=this.searchQuery.toLowerCase();return a.Patient.toLowerCase().includes(e)||a.Doctor.toLowerCase().includes(e)}).slice(0,this.visibleCount):this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(a=>setTimeout(a,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},C={class:"search-container"},E={class:"card-container"},W=["disabled"],B={key:0},R={key:1};function O(a,e,h,u,n,s){const y=f("PoemCard");return o(),i("section",null,[e[3]||(e[3]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🤔 AI effective tips collection 🧠")])],-1)),t("div",C,[e[2]||(e[2]=t("span",{class:"search-icon"},null,-1)),g(t("input",{type:"text",class:"search-input","onUpdate:modelValue":e[0]||(e[0]=r=>n.searchQuery=r),placeholder:"Search..."},null,512),[[p,n.searchQuery]])]),t("div",E,[(o(!0),i(w,null,b(s.filteredPoems,(r,m)=>(o(),v(y,{key:m,poem:r},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),s.hasMorePoems?(o(),i("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:n.isLoading,onClick:e[1]||(e[1]=(...r)=>s.loadMore&&s.loadMore(...r))},[n.isLoading?(o(),i("span",R,"Loading...")):(o(),i("span",B,"See more"))],8,W)):k("",!0)])}const N=c(q,[["render",O],["__scopeId","data-v-bf827d07"]]),j=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"chatai/13.md","filePath":"chatai/13.md"}'),Y={name:"chatai/13.md"},L=Object.assign(Y,{setup(a){return(e,h)=>(o(),i("div",null,[I(N)]))}});export{j as __pageData,L as default};
