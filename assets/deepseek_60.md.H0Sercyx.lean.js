I am a 30 years old male. It all started with itchy scalp ten months back this summer. But, I was not concerned much, since it was just itchy and some bumps like mosquito bites (not more than two to three) and some swelling as well. Since it was summer, I was sweating. Sometimes, the whole scalp would itch and sometimes only the bumps. It continued for some months. Later, itching of the scalp subsided and bumps size has decreased. But since three to four months, I can feel pimple like things on my scalp and they ache sometimes. When they started, they would disappear on their own in less than a week. But now, even after so many months, I can feel some more (not more than two at a time) pimples. I doubt whether it could be folliculitis. I have not had a haircut since ten months, just because I thought the itching could be contagious. So, I better not go for a haircut and spread it to others. There are two to three bumps on my face as well. One was hurting earlier, but it is all itchy and the other two are only itchy. I would like to state it again that they do not itch all the time and one that aches do not hurt at all the time. Also, I felt a pimple like thing on my butt. It disappeared in a week. It was not very painful. I have had folliculitis till I was 25. So, I know how much it pains and itches. I thought it could be folliculitis. My father had a boil and got better in two weeks and everything was fine. So, I thought maybe the spread of same bacteria. Getting pimples on my butt have become regular. They come and go and they appeared on my face only after that. We are a family of four. I have OCD as well and cannot tolerate these skin diseases. I wash my hands and taps touched by him every time he touches them. The only thing that I share is the bathroom tap and latrine tap and also latrine bucket. Apart from them, I do not touch anything from him. When I try to touch the pimple like things on my butt, I cannot feel them. They do not appear to be there. Also, before the pimple like things started to appear, I had some scratchy and cracked elbows (pictures included) and it was painful. I was scared and thought it is somehow related to that boil. It healed in two weeks. This happened four months back. From then on only all pimple like things started appearing in the same month. Unfortunately, I do not have the picture. And the ones on the face and scalp are covered with hair, so there is no way I can click it. Now, my question is whether I can go for a haircut and beard trimming? I have not trimmed my hair since five months, all because of these reasons to not spread it to others and myself. I will use electric shaver to trim my beard. How can I have my haircut without spreading it to others? My hairs are now getting twisted and unmanageable, since I have not covered them either. My social life has suffered a lot because of it. And, what is it (disease) that has taken away my freedom, social life and confidence? Also, what can I use to disinfect my electric shaver, the blades, nail cutter and other such things? What I do is soak in boiling water for 30 minutes and then wash it with dish gel and dettol. I am waiting for your answers. Thank you.","Doctor":"Hi. I have checked your photos (attachments removed to protect patient identity). It is better you go for haircut and shave or trim beard. It may be due to folliculitis or fungal infection by the description. You can get it examined by a doctor or dermatologist for physical evaluation and diagnosis. You need not worry about spreading infection to others. You can use separate trimmer for yourself or get it done by a barber with separate trimmer. The disinfection method you are following should be fine. You can use topical antibiotic cream like Mupirocin (T-bact) if pus filled lesions are present. Do not worry about transmission of diseases. You can wash your hands with soap and water after using washroom. The lesion on elbow appears to be due to dryness. You can use moisturizing soap or Cetaphil cleanser. Apply moisturizing cream like Ponds or Cetraben cream. Main ingredients of this cream are (White soft paraffin and Light Liquid paraffin).

The left and right ears are blocked with some air or water like state. I have this ear pain for four days gradually on the same pain note. I have taken Aceclofenac with Paracetamol and Amoxicillin. I have also tried Otorex ear drops but the pain neither reduced or increased. The right ear is a kind of inflamed and not even let the drops go through. I am already on Deplatt A, Concor, and Imdur in the morning and Amlong and Rosuvastatin in the night for my angina complaint. I am also on Thyronorm 75 mcg in the morning. I am scared to go out to a hospital due to the pandemic effects, so please advise.","Doctor":"Hi. It looks like you have developed what we call as eustachian tube catarrh. This tube ventilates both the nose and the ear and can get blocked due to allergy or sinusitis or in any upper respiratory infection such as common flu. If you have allergic issues, it has to be adequately treated. Tablet Sinarest (a combination of Acetaminophen, Chlorpheniramine, and Pseudoephedrine) one tablet two times a day, i.e., 12 hours apart for one week can be considered. Otrivin nasal drops three drops three times a day for 10 days should also help. Valsalva exercise 15 to 20 times a day. Steam inhalations also do give a little relief. Antibiotics and painkillers will not help as it does not treat the problem. However, complete the course of your antibiotics and do not stop them halfway. I hope this helps."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor,I am trying to conceive but my husband and I did cocaine a week ago. How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

He vomited and had lot of salt water. Please advice for any side effect.","Doctor":"Hi. I want to assure you not to worry as everything is going to be fine if proper care and treatment is opted in for. I have thoroughly gone through your case and can well understand your genuine health concerns. 1. No, there is not much problem right now as he vomited and also had a lot of water. It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases. Because, it is a volatile compound and causes vapors entering the lungs through the airways. 3. As it was only two drops, I do not think it may cause much trouble. If he feels short of breath contact me back, otherwise fine. 1. He should avoid re-exposure. 2.

For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations. If the size and number of cysts are more, then I suggest consulting a gynecologist as you may require surgery. If the number and size of cysts are less, you may continue treatment along with syrup Evecare 10 ml BD and Kanchnar Guggulu two BD.

She had taken my blood sample and it was negative. But, still I have not gotten my periods and it has been a week ahead. What could be the reason for my late periods?","Doctor":"Hello. As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses.

There are many causes for low back pain. It can be due to faulty posture, related to weak muscles, issues with intervertebral disc, narrowing of spinal canal, any bony instability besides many other. So, accurate diagnosis is the key to proper management of the condition. If you have localized back pain with no other symptoms like radiating leg pain, neurological symptoms like numbness, weakness, paresthesias, etc., then you can start with the following recommendations for an initial period of 2-3 weeks. We will observe you for the next 2-3 weeks regarding how you respond to this conservative management protocol. If you are not feeling better, then we will have to get some investigations like dynamic x-rays of lower back and few blood tests for evaluation.

I have consulted my family doctor and a neurologist. All physical tests showed no actual weakness. There were no other clinical signs and the reflexes were also normal. There is no activity or movement that I cannot do. When I run, I feel normal. The sensation has persisted and is difficult to describe. Sometimes it feels like weakness, but sometimes like an ache down my leg, particularly when I sit down for a longer period of time and then I feel sore on my lower left back, just above by buttocks. Overall, if I had to describe the sensation in my left leg, I will describe it as a sense of weakness. Apart from the persisting feeling of weakness, I have also noticed muscle twitches all over my body, including my left foot and primarily in both my legs. I know I have been aware of these for years, but I have been more aware of them lately. Every morning for the past three to four weeks, my left foot feels tight, a slight pain when I am walking. But, it does not persist all day and if I do not think about it, then it feels normal. If I do think about it, then it feels as if I am going to have foot drop, although it does not actually happen. On top of this, I frequently feel a sense of vibration at the bottom of my left foot particularly when lying or sitting down. It is hard to tell whether this is a spasm or numbness or tingling. In the past two weeks, I have had two periods of probably two to three days where I have felt cramped and tightness in my left leg particularly at the top of my left calf. I have had a brain MRI, which came back as normal. I have had a left knee ultrasound performed which shows a varicose small saphenous vein and my family doctor does not believe this explains my symptoms. Furthermore, I have had a lumbar CT which returned the following results. At L5-S1 moderate broad left paracentral disc protrusion mildly distorting the anterior aspect of the thecal sac and abutting without displacing the traversing nerve roots. Minor disc extension into the foramen at this level without exiting L5 nerve root impingement. Minor changes in the other levels also as described. However, again, my family doctor does not believe this is the cause of my symptoms. He maintains it is most likely from anxiety. I am a 21 year old medical student and to be completely honest, I made the mistake of initially looking up my symptoms online. I have been very anxious since I started experiencing the sense of weakness, as I am worried about the possibility of having ALS. I have constantly been stretching my legs and trying to test my left leg as a result. What is your recommendation? Also, could you please include what you think of the possibility of ALS, as this is my biggest concern at the moment. Thank you so much for your time.","Doctor":"Hi. The various symptoms you have described are due to L5-S1 moderate broad left paracentral disc protrusion mildly distorted the anterior aspect of the thecal sac and abutting without displacing the traversing nerve roots. When a disc prolapses and compresses the spinal cord in cervical and thoracic levels, we get myelopathy. When it compresses the root, we get radiculopathy. But, please note that even when a prolapsed disc does not directly compress the spinal cord or nerve root, it can still produce symptoms if it compresses the blood vessels and interferes with blood flow. As a rule, veins are more easily compressed than arteries and the epidural plexus of veins are compressed by the prolapsed disc. This leads to venous stasis and the metabolites are not washed away from the nerve roots. However, this compression is dependant on the posture. When you move a bit, the pressure gets released and the blood flow resumes and the metabolites are washed and the nerve becomes functionally normal. So, even though you may be having symptoms at one time or another, the moment you walk to your doctor's room and climb the examination couch, all metabolites are washed away and your examination does not find any abnormality. However, the good news is that this condition can be treated by very simple postural adjustments as follows.

According to my doctor, it happens from genetic since both parents suffering from it. Usually, I have a problem with diastolic blood pressure. It has reached 95, and even more since the systolic stays with 130 or max 140, since that time, I am using Amlodipine 5 mg and Concor 2.5 mg in the morning daily. My pressure is very good with the two pills, and, it is always 110/75. My question is about Amlodipine. Can I change it with another medicine? I am asking this because since I start with it, I started feeling tinnitus in both ears. Is it possible to be the reason? I saw in one report that Amlodipine cause tinnitus some time.","Doctor":"Hello. It is rare, but yes Amlodipine can cause tinnitus, and it is worthwhile to change it to other medications. The best alternative option is of ARBs (Angiotension II receptor blockers) like Telmisartan. The equivalent dose would be 40 mg once daily, and it would take a week for full effect. And, if blood pressure remains elevated after a week, which is unlikely, then you may need 80 mg. If Telmisartan is not available, then Olmesartan 20 mg is equivalent to Telmisartan 40 mg. It may take a few weeks for it to disappear after stopping it. If it persists after few weeks, then it needs to get examined by ENT specialist for other causes.

Her main symptoms have been Raynaud's and esophageal issues. She also has Alzheimer's and a history of recurrent C.diff colitis. She took Plaquenil for several years and her CREST symptoms appeared stable. So, when her rheumatologist retired, we did not locate a new one. Her general doctor kept her on Plaquenil and she continued her routine testing with her eye doctor. She was hospitalized recently with C.diff and also developed pneumonia and a GI bleed, which was treated as an ulcer and got better. She did have an upper GI series, which showed no stricture, but esophageal dismotility with no peristalsis. She used to have her esophagus dilated often in the past years, but had a rupture before six years after a procedure. It healed on its own and since then. We have avoided having her scoped. The hospital doctor suggested discontinuing her Plaquenil and he said that it could make her more susceptible to infections. Prior to the hospitalization, she had declined in her physical health and lost 10 pounds in six months and the Alzheimer's is advancing. She has been discharged from the hospital and is in a long-term care facility. My question is, in general, does Plaquenil provide a benefit to the esophagus? Would it really be that much of an immunosuppressant for someone in her condition? In general terms, what are the benefits versus risks?

If the size and number of cysts are more, then I suggest consulting a gynecologist as you may require surgery. If the number and size of cysts are less, you may continue treatment along with syrup Evecare 10 ml BD and Kanchnar Guggulu two BD.

She had taken my blood sample and it was negative. But, still I have not gotten my periods and it has been a week ahead. What could be the reason for my late periods?","Doctor":"Hello. As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses.

I had thick transparent penile discharge with burning and itching sensation. I got this after a week of having unprotected oral sex. I have had urethral swab and urine test done, and the reports showed ureaplasma urealyticum. I have been treated with Ceftriaxone and Azithromycin for urethritis. And with Azithromycin, Tobrex, and Aureomycin for conjunctivitis. Most of the symptoms disappeared after a week, but since then, I still have the penile discharge throughout the day, the discharge leaves black stains in my underwear. I have a strange sensation of pressure in my prostate, and it burns when I pee. Sometimes, it burns slightly after ejaculation also. In the eye, I still have inflammation of both my eyelids and discomfort in one eye. In the past month, I saw a urologist again, and I have been treated with Azithromycin and Ciflox for two weeks, Doxycycline for eight weeks, and Flagyl for two weeks, but with no improvement. I also had several swabs, urine tests, and a sperm culture, which all came back negative. I got an MRI of the prostate that showed an inflamed prostate. For the eyes, I have been prescribed Ciclosporin and Ketotifen for six months. I have never had urethral swab after a prostate massage because my urologist said it is useless. Now, my urologist thinks of putting me on Cortisone for two months. Do you think it is a good idea? Do you have any explanation for the remaining symptoms? Do you think there is a link between eyes and genital symptoms? Thank you for your help.","Doctor":"Hi.

Although you have rightly taken the emergency contraceptive pill both the time well within 72 hours after intimacy, so considering that she had her first bleed on time, it is likely that her next menses would anyhow be delayed by few days as a side effect known with I-pill. Now that you have taken an I-pill again, the bleeding should be expected by seven to 10 days ideally, but you can wait another week for withdrawal bleed to start naturally. If no bleed in next seven days then get a urine pregnancy test done to rule out pregnancy, possibly due to I-pill failure and if the test is negative then you can opt for a progesterone-induced withdrawal.

During sleep or when it is erected, skin is automatically moving below the ring and automatically coming back to normal position. Here are my questions.  Even after circumcision, does moving or retraction of the skin below and above the ring matter? I am having a little bit difficulty to move the skin to below the ring with my hand, during masturbation. Even sometimes it is moving on its own when erected. Is it okay? Will this affect my sex life in future? I am doubtful that I might be having less natural lubricant under the skin of my penis. Because of that, I see some pain if I hardly rub my penis during masturbation. Can we hardly rub the penis during masturbation? If yes, is this pain common? Do I have natural lubricant issue under the skin of penis? Please clarify my questions in detail, as I am shy to ask these questions to a doctor directly.","Doctor":"Hello. Relax and do not worry. After circumcision, you will not have any skin on your penis head. If you pull also, it will go back to the ring of the penis head. So, that is normal.

How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

Since then, palpitations had reduced quite a bit and I only had premature beats sometimes. Four days back, I had not slept well the previous night and in the afternoon, I had a very heavy lunch at work.

At the time of normal acid production while sleeping we will not have any problems. If acid production in stomach is more, then while lying down acid tends to come to esophagus (upwards from stomach). It can come up to throat. Acid causes irritation of diaphragm (sheet separating lungs from stomach), which can cause increased breathing. The sensation of something stuck in the throat is severe irritation of throat due to increase in acidity in stomach. If gastritis is present, then the acid comes up to the throat called regurgitation and causes this sensation. Burping is due to acid and air coming up due to gastritis. Rablet-D (Rabeprazole) is correct choice of a tablet. But, the potency and quality is very less. Gastritis can due to many reasons like not eating food at proper intervals, drinking too much coffee or tea, eating hot and spicy foods, cola and junk foods, less sleep, increased work pressure, tension and too much of worrying.

Phimosis is a condition in which the foreskin is too tight to be pulled back over the head or glans of the penis. Now this can happen due to a number of reasons, and can be diagnosed only after examination. This usually happens when one does not clean under the foreskin, can lead to bacteria, fungus or other germs accumulating there. When this happens for some time, it can lead to balanitis inflammation of the glans, or the head, of the penis). Has this happened before? (Tight, shiny skin on the glans, redness around the glans, itchiness, or irritation of the glans, an unpleasant smell, tight foreskin that cannot be pulled back,etc.). When this happens it can lead to phimosis. After examination only I will be able to diagnose whether it is balanitis or phimosis and whether this is due to bacteria or fungus or some other cause. The treatment varies depending on the findings. Therefore, if the pain is severe, it would be best to take him to a urologist and get it examined. On the other hand, if the penis is red and swollen, you should take him to the emergency room. If you want, I can give you a cream for the pain, but if there is infection, there is a chance it will become worse.

It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

I have thoroughly gone through your case and can well understand your genuine health concerns. 1. No, there is not much problem right now as he vomited and also had a lot of water. It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases.

If he feels short of breath contact me back, otherwise fine. 1. He should avoid re-exposure. 2.

For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations. If the size and number of cysts are more, then I suggest consulting a gynecologist as you may require surgery.

She had taken my blood sample and it was negative. But, still I have not gotten my periods and it has been a week ahead. What could be the reason for my late periods?","Doctor":"Hello. As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses.

I need help what can I do ???","Doctor":"Hi, I hope you are doing well. I can understand your concern. I need to know, whether she had past history of hypertension, or she was on any medication prior to this episode. The sudden rise to Blood pressure can be due to simple stress, anxiety some time pain. If she is known hypertensive then skipping medication can cause a sudden rise of Blood pressure. I have noticed that her diastolic BP was high. You need to monitor her BP regularly. also in supine position and standing position. Also during day time and night time. Do three to four readings of BP. It will give us an Idea about her blood pressure fluctuation. The symptoms she is having are probably due to low blood pressure. especially hypertensive elderly people tend to take less salt than required which leads to low salt in their body, resulting in hyponatremia. which can result in such symptoms. I suggest you monitor Blood pressure. If possible do Serum electrolyte and Random blood sugar and creatinine. continue Amlodipine as advised by your doctor. I t can be changed as per BP monitoring.

Make sure that you have sufficient foreplay to stimulate the vaginal secretions which will act as a natural lubricant.

I have nodules in the thyroid gland since last two years. Initially, it started as a feeling of imbalance in the head about two years back. The initial assumption was vertigo and later it was found to be a small nodule in the left lobe. The blood test performed about one and half years ago revealed T3 104 ng/dL, T4 6.60 ug/dL and TSH 0.04 mU/L. The blood test performed about a year ago revealed a TSH of 68 mU/L. The blood test performed 10 months back showed T3 108.8 ng/dL, T4 7.2 ug/dL, TSH 0.73 mU/L, cholesterol 196 mg/dL and blood pressure 90/130 mmHg. The blood test performed about two weeks ago showed T3 128.5 ng/dL, T4 8.8 ug/dL, TSH 0.73 mU/L, blood pressure 100/140 mmHg, cholesterol  96 mg/dL, cholesterol serum 235 mg/dL, triglycerides 193 mg/dL, LDL 143 mg/dL, HDL 53 mg/dL, VLDL 39 mg/dL and FBS plasma 96 mg/dL. The present signs and symptoms include trembling hands, high tension, anxiety, weight gain, blood pressure, kind of numbness in head and a type of balance missing (not giddiness).

My scar is very near my glans, with an unsightly blemish near the center.

I also have excess hair along the shaft of my penis, and my scrotal skin connects just underneath the glans.

He snores every night and tosses and turns and has trouble breathing through his nose. His doctor says he has enlarged tonsils and adenoids. I think he has obstructed sleep apnea because I hear him gasping for air sometimes. We did a sleep study and the night of the sleep study he slept well. But every night at home he has a lot of trouble sleeping. He wakes up a lot, talks in his sleep has nightmares and I think he has sleep apnea because I hear him gasping for air sometimes. The doctor said we could try Flonaise to help him. But we read that Flonaise can stunt a child’s growth. The doctor said he could grow into his tonsils. And I also heard that 2 years old is very young for tonsil surgery. My questions are how worried should I be about his troubled seeping? I am not getting any sleep lately because I listen to him all night. Is it dangerous to let him go on trying to sleep and have so much trouble breathing each night with possible sleep apnea? Please help. I am very concerned.","Doctor":"Hi. If symptoms are too severe we can go for tonsil and adenoid surgery now also. Flonase is a steroid and it does not affect growth as it will be administered inside the nostril and will have the action only there. There will not be any systemic or bloodstream absorption. How much worried you should be about his tonsil and sleep apnea problem are: 1. Change in facial features producing adenoid facies. 2. Irritability of kid. 3. He cannot hear properly due to adenoids blocking ear tubes. 4. Ear discharge. 5. Reduced development of speech. Do not get worried just because of the snoring and sleep apnea. Give him nasal steroids and antihistaminic syrup (like Zyrtec or Allegra syrup) of appropriate dosage. In some cases, we even give oral steroid syrup. It does not cause any stunting the way you have understood. Once you exhaust the above medical treatment option and find no or not much benefit we can discuss about the surgery. Your doctor is right in giving the medicines Flonase, etc. That is the protocol. We can follow the same here. The decision to operate may vary with different surgeon.

How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations.

As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves.

For the last several days, he has been complaining of erectile dysfunction, urinary hesitancy, drooping of the lip to one side during smiling, occasional numbness in extremities, etc. He has significant loss of memory (only short term) and behavioral problems. He asked me if he should be further investigated to rule out organic disease if any. So, I advised him am MRI (myself an MBBS doctor). MRI showed multiple hyperintense lesions in bilateral frontal lobes, parietal lobes and these changes were attributed to chronic ischemia by the radiologist. Now, I am concerned if his condition is merely a psychiatric disorder or a result of some organic disease. He was never investigated earlier, and all this time he was put on SSRIs and benzodiazepines for OCD. Kindly do help me regarding the same and guide me for the next step in his workup.

It feels as if I will get my periods, but still, I did not get it.","Doctor":"Hi. I-pill only makes the hormonal environment unsuitable for the embryo to get attached to the uterus lining. It makes the inner uterine lining thicker, which may not shed immediately. If you have never had a normal delivery before, your cervical opening will be very narrow. So, the thicker inner lining of your uterus is trying to come out of the same narrow cervical canal which is causing the severe cramps and lower abdominal discomfort. The effectiveness of I-pill depends on, after how many hours of unprotected sex you had the pill and in which half of the menstrual cycle you were in. It is most effective if taken within 72 hours, but the earlier, the better. For now, I suggest you wait, but if you do not have periods past your due date, consult a gynecologist and get a pregnancy test done.

How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

There are two ways by which tooth gets discolored: a) External factors b) Internal factors  a) External factor: The change in the color of the tooth topically by external agents. 1) Black and brown stains on the tooth surface. Causes: - smoking - consumption of tea and coffee 2)Yellowish stains on the tooth surface. Causes - deposition of plaque (dental plaque is the deposition of a thin layer containing numerous bacteria around the tooth).  b)Internal factors: 1) Brownish-yellow discoloration of tooth. Causes - Consumption of tetracycline during the formation of teeth. Deciduous tooth formation takes place when the baby is in the womb. If the pregnant lady consumes tetracycline antibiotic during second half of pregnancy onwards, that causes staining of the tooth. The permanent tooth formation takes place before the age of 8 yrs, if in that duration the child is put on tetracycline medication it will cause staining of the teeth. 2)Greyish-yellow discoloration of tooth. Causes: -Dental caries: breakdown of tooth structure by bacterial action. -Pulp necrosis: it is a condition in which tissue inside the tooth dies.  c)White patches on the tooth surface. Causes - Enamel hypoplasia.  d)Brownish discoloration of tooth. Causes - Excessive intake of flouride (dental fluorosis). Depending upon the causes of the tooth discoloration, the following treatment can be decided: 1. Oral prophylaxis (dental scaling). 2. Bleaching. 3. Dental laminates. 4. Veneer. 5. Crowns. 6.

How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

I want to assure you not to worry as everything is going to be fine if proper care and treatment is opted in for. I have thoroughly gone through your case and can well understand your genuine health concerns. 1. No, there is not much problem right now as he vomited and also had a lot of water. It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases. Because, it is a volatile compound and causes vapors entering the lungs through the airways. 3. As it was only two drops, I do not think it may cause much trouble. If he feels short of breath contact me back, otherwise fine. 1. He should avoid re-exposure. 2.

For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations. If the size and number of cysts are more, then I suggest consulting a gynecologist as you may require surgery.

As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses.

The pain is intermittent and often relieved by passing stool. My gynecologist advised me for Mantoux, which came out as positive. I am planning for a baby for three months. My menstrual cycle is fairly regular with an interval of 21 days and I have dysmenorrhea since my menarche. Am I suffering from genital tuberculosis?","Doctor":"Hi. Mantoux positive is showing sensitivity to tuberculin antigen. It is a screening test and not a confirmatory test. If it comes positive, then do TB PCR (tuberculosis polymerase chain reaction) for confirmation. If that too comes positive, then it means there is a chance of genital TB and you have to take treatment for it for around four to six months accordingly. If TB PCR is negative, then you do not have to worry.

I have read your query in detail and viewed all the reports (attachment removed to protect patient identity) and do understand your concern. As you indulged in protective sex, your risk of acquiring any STD (sexually transmitted disease) or HIV (human immunodeficiency virus) from someone is already very meager.  All your tests are correct and there is no need to get them repeated. For gonorrhea and chlamydia again PCR has been done, which is extremely reliable and can pick up even a few organisms if present in the body. Fourth generation HIV ELISA test has been done, which is very accurate and can pick up infection at very early stage. There is no need to repeat it. Anti-HCV (hepatitis C virus antibody) and HBsAg (hepatitis B surface antigen) done at 60 days is not confirmatory. If your physician suspects any symptoms, then you may get them repeated after three to six months. Viral load test for HCV and HBV are very accurate if done now and confirmatory, but are quite expensive. No other test required. Your symptoms of slightly yellow urine, sometimes pain while urinating, frequent urination are due to urinary infection. For urinary infection, your doctor has put you on suitable antibiotics and these should be taken religiously. Other concerns like burning after defecation, muscular pains, etc., all are non specific symptoms. It can also be seen without any underlying cause. Some symptoms are psychological, which happens very commonly when you are living under the fear of acquiring HIV.

Your clinical image (attachment removed to protect patient identity) is confirmative for a verruca plana, which is a plane viral wart. All warts are caused by human papilloma virus (HPV); however the strains causing it are different. On the face, it is usually due to HPV 3 and 10. The vaccines available for HPV are mainly to cover for genital warts caused by HPV 16, 18, 31 and 33. These vaccines do not protect you against the normal skin warts as they are caused by totally different strains of HPV. Taking a vaccine can only protect you against the four strains causing warts on your genitalia. I would advise to go for electrosurgical removal of your wart as it is safe and effective.

Acid reflux occurs when acid travels up the food pipe to the mouth. This can happen when the muscle at the bottom of the food pipe which acts as a gateway to the stomach becomes weak or loose. Heartburn is a burning sensation in the chest or abdomen and it has nothing do with the heart. People feel heartburn behind the breast bone after eating. In some cases, pain can be felt in the back as well. So symptoms of heartburn caused by acid reflux include a burning sensation in the chest, a sour taste in the mouth and pain in the middle of the back. You can take syrup Gaviscon, Domperidone (thrice daily before each meal) with Lansoprazole (once daily before meal) and you should always remember that your acid reflux may worsen the asthma condition."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor,I had my period 15 days after my previous one. Normally, my periods are irregular, they are 10 to 15 days late or sometimes early, but not 15 days after the old one. Is it normal? I did not have sex but was close with my fiance just two days after my previous periods. His penis was on my vaginal part but was not inserted and neither did he ejaculate there, and then I had my periods 15 days after the previous one. I read that implantation bleeding also occurs like the period and is hard to distinguish. My period lasted for 5 to 6 days, and the bleeding was normal. What can be this? Was it a normal period?","Doctor":"Hi. As you have described your history that irregular periods are already there. You are a teenager as well could have some irregularities in cycles as the phase of development but continuous irregular cycles need to be investigated actually. Strict diet, strenuous exercise, hormonal imbalance, illness, medications, contraceptives all can delay periods actually. For pregnancy, a single sperm can help to conceive otherwise in case of hormonal imbalance women used to take medications, extra health precautions for years to conceive. So it is luck as well. For safe side, you can have serum beta hCG (blood pregnancy test) to check your pregnancy status. If it comes negative, then you can have combined oral contraceptive pills cyclically for three months to aid your menstrual imbalance. In case of a negative test of serum beta hCG, you can have a transvaginal scan and on day two periods can have blood tests (serum progesterone, testosterone, insulin, thyroid function test, prolactin), collect all results and can discuss here or with your local gynecologist as per your convenience. Blood pregnancy test will completely guide you correctly.

How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases.

For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations.

As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves.

The rashes on my hands and feet have lesions. The rashes are not itchy, except for those with lesions. I also have a small wound (or sore) on my anus, which has been there for three weeks now. I believe this is syphilis. I have taken Loratadine for seven days, as prescribed by a doctor here. However, nothing happened. I cannot have it checked due to the quarantine in my area. Does my condition need immediate medical care? Or can I take medicine to treat this while waiting for the ECQ to be lifted? I did not have a fever or flu when this started.

How many sexual partners have you had? Male or female? Are you aware of your partner's promiscuity? What do you do? Any other diseases? Is this the first time this has happened? Besides Loratadine have you tried taking any other medications? Any allergies? Based on the given health data, it is likely you may have secondary syphilis. Can you send photos of the rashes on your trunk or arms? Where did it start and how did it spread? Any throat pain or gun lesions? If you're having difficulty of breathing, fever, changes in sensorium, numbness or weakness please proceed to the ER. Otherwise, we could start treatment for now but will require laboratory results to confirm the diagnosis. Please do VDRL or RPR (whichever is available) and FTA-ABS or TPPA (whichever is available).

The results may turn out negative if you have taken your dose and if it is negative we will have to stop the treatment). Regarding dandruff, I suggest to shave your beard. Use anti-dandruff shampoos. May continue the application of moisturizer on the affected area. Regarding the burning sensation, it maybe related to syphilis. Are there any rashes present? Is it often damp? Is the area reddish? Continue to take baths and maintain good proper hygiene. Please send your CBC (complete blood count) results.

I am currently on Atenolol 100 mg, Crestor 40 mg, and Effexor 75 mg. Please help.","Doctor":"Hello. I have evaluated your echo report. In your case, the echo clearly shows that AR (atrial regurgitation) is due to a localized prolapse of the anterior half of RCC (right coronary cusp). So it is not due to coaptation failure. By general rule, tallness has nothing to do with AR although there is a relation of large arm span (Marfan) associated with dilated aortic root producing AR. According to the guidelines, aortic stenosis should be surgically managed if associated with LVEF (left ventricular ejection fraction) less than 40% and dilatation of left ventricle cavity. Since you have only mild left ventricle dysfunction as of now, it is a wise choice to defer surgery. Grade 1 diastolic dysfunction is normal with someone with moderate AR.

But yes, there is data that hypothyroidism can affect brain development and function in baby permanently and whatever damage occurs is irreversible. If you are taking Thyroxine (Levothyroxine) 50 mg and the level is this high, then you need to increase the dose. And, if you have started treatment just now, then continue and repeat according to the doctor.

I have severe nasal congestion from a suspected cold or sinus infection (I have not been to the doctor yet). When Pseudoephedrine (Sudafed tablets) was not working, the pharmacist suggested to try Otrivin Plus nasal spray. Both give slight relief but I forgot to ask if I can take both together. Is it okay if I take both simultaneously until I can get to my GP?","Doctor":"Hello. With the details provided, I understand that you are a 22 year old female suffering from cold or sinus infection causing nasal blockage. Currently you are taking Sudafed tablets and Otrivin plus nasal spray. Presuming that the Sudafed tablets you use contains only Pseudoephedrine, I would say that it is perfectly alright to take Sudafed and Otrivin plus together. Both have similar actions and will act to decrease the nasal congestion and relieve the blocked nose. Pseudoephedrine tablets will get absorbed into blood and act systemically. However otrivin nasal spray being sprayed into nasal mucosa will act only locally with very little systemic absorption through the blood vessels. The two compounds have slightly different mechanisms of action as well and use different set of receptors and messengers to bring about their action. You need to worry about their combined action only if you suffer from hypertension or elevated blood pressure. Otherwise till you meet your GP it is fine to take both together. However, do not take Pseudoephedrine more than twice a day in normal strength. If it is maximal strength tablet then take not more than once a day unless advised by your GP. However follow these general instructions till your GP makes a decisive diagnosis and institutes the most appropriate treatment for you.

At the young age of 11, itching around the time of periods may be just minor infection. Usual infections are respiratory infection or urinary infection. If you have any respiratory infection, suppose you cough into hands later if you wash your genitals with same hands after using the wash room. This will transmit the infection to vaginal area, and you get itching around area. Same is with urinary infection. When you have periods, the vascularity of the vagina and surrounding area is increased. When the vascularity increases the infection flares up, and you get itching. Another possibility is just skin dryness. For further doubts consult an obstetrician and gynaecologist online -->"},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I was just diagnosed with PCOS.

Please get yourself checked by a gynecologist and get a pelvic scan done to rule out the exact cause of brownish discharge. The fishy smell of vagina is mainly because of some vaginal infection. Avoid having sex till then. Wear cotton panties and loose lowers. Maintain personal hygiene and take plenty of fluids. Wash your private parts with normal tap water every time you use the washroom. Avoid using vaginal douches and creams. Do get back to me with reports so that I can guide you further. Take care."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, My mother is 65 years old.

I initially saw a gynecologist who tried oral contraceptive pills, microgynon, and spironolactone. She did a battery of blood tests and ultrasounds to confirm I have the condition. A general physician prescribed Metformin a few years back. All of the medications had little to no effect. Recently, I was referred to an endocrinologist and it was discovered that I have a missing 21 hydroxylase enzyme. Other tests were done but were normal. My cortisol was fine. However, my testosterone levels were high and it was found that I was indeed Insulin resistant. The endocrinologist has put me back on Metformin 500 mg, three times daily and has requested that I return and see them in six months. I suffer from severe hirsutism, thinning of hair on the scalp, and obesity. Despite me being active and having a fairly good diet, it has been extremely difficult to lose weight. I cannot help but think that they have missed something. Can you have adrenal hyperplasia with insulin resistance? They have said no more to me with regards to the missing enzyme. None of the doctors seem to be able to treat my condition.","Doctor":"Hello. I just read your query and from what you have mentioned, it appears that you have a 21-hydroxylase deficiency and that causes an excess of testosterone and androstenedione causing virilization of females and PCOS. This is the cause of your hirsutism and insulin resistance as well. The treatment of Metformin is alright, but you also need oral contraceptives to combat these excess androgens produced. The missing enzyme cannot be replaced. Only the resultant issues arising from its deficiency can be dealt with. Since your cortisol was fine, the doctors are not worried about the missing enzyme anymore. Yes, you can have adrenal hyperplasia and insulin resistance together. Please try to exercise as well as to lose some weight as it helps with your symptoms. Hope you find my advice of some benefit. Good luck.

So, she has been consulting some neurosurgeons for some time but no major problem has been detected by them. Recently, the pain has increased a lot. She had consulted a nearby orthopedic surgeon.

He has suggested my mother take physical rest for more than two months and he has given some medication. He has been saying that the current issue with L4-L5 disc bulge is not very serious and can be treated with medication and physical rest.

All the medical reports and MRI reports have been attached to this email. I hope for the best treatment for her in the current scenario.","Doctor":"Hello.

How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm?

Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method.

For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations.

As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves.

Excess pounds put pressure on your abdomen, pushing up your stomach and causing acid to reflux into your esophagus. Stop smoking. Smoking decreases the lower esophageal sphincter's ability to function properly. Elevate the head of your bed. If you regularly experience heartburn while trying to sleep, place wood or cement blocks under the feet of your bed so that the head end is raised by 6 to 9 inches. If you cannot elevate your bed, you can insert a wedge between your mattress and box spring to elevate your body from the waist up. Raising your head with additional pillows is not effective. Do not lie down after a meal. Wait at least three hours after eating before lying down or going to bed. Eat food slowly and chew thoroughly. Put down your fork after every bite and pick it up again once you have chewed and swallowed that bite. Avoid foods and drinks that trigger reflux. Common triggers include fatty or fried foods, tomato sauce, alcohol, chocolate, mint, garlic, onion, and caffeine. Avoid tight-fitting clothing.

For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations. If the size and number of cysts are more, then I suggest consulting a gynecologist as you may require surgery.

She had taken my blood sample and it was negative. But, still I have not gotten my periods and it has been a week ahead. What could be the reason for my late periods?","Doctor":"Hello. As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses.

We have visited our gynaecologist to watch whether the pain is due to labour or not. After checking, he said the pain is not for labour. He prescribed pain killer Duvadilan retard (Isoxsuprine capsules) twice a day for five weeks, giving an opinion that he does not want any labour before the end of 37th week of pregnancy. Last week she had pain again and my doctor advised her to observe one night with Drotin injection. She was fine with that and the doctor adviced for steroid injection (attachment) the next day and discharged her by advising that if pain arises again, she has to go for C-section or otherwise he will go for the same after 2 weeks. Today, from morning our baby suddenly stopped its movement for quite a long time. So, we got afraid and asked for an appointment with our doctor. He has given appointment in the evening only. We have done a USG now and have sent you the report. Kindly interpret the same.  Do you think there is any deficiency in the treatment process? What is the actual reason for those injections? Will they harm our baby? How is our baby ? And finally I want to tell you that my wife has lost 1 Kg in the last 2 weeks. What may be its cause and will it harm my baby? She still is suffering with pain in the back and lower abdomen, as well as vagina. What to do?","Doctor":"Hello. I have gone through the reports (attachment removed to protect patient identity). The ultrasound report is perfectly fine and the baby is average 36 weeks of gestation and head down position, placenta is normal and so is the AFI (Amniotic Fluid Index) and weight of the baby. As the baby is 36 weeks sonologically there was actually no requirement for an antenatal corticosteroid injection for promoting fetal lung maturity, which is being given only before 34 weeks gestation in cases of threatened preterm labour when it is suspected that the lady may go in labour and the baby may not be able to breathe once out in external environment. Hence steroids are given, but by now lungs have matured and baby can survive easily after birth. But that injection given prophylactically has no harm at all. The pain in lower back and lower abdomen is normal to have. Now, in the late third trimester, she would have frequent urination feeling very often. She would experience Braxton Hicks contractions which are mimicking labour contractions but are not labour as they are not intense, increasing in frequency and not continuous. So, they just come and go. It can be mistaken as false labour. If the pain subsides with any pain relief given or uterine relaxant given, then it is not labour. The plan to deliver after 37 weeks is acceptable but with an elective c-section is not justified. If the baby is fine, head is down, baby movements are normal ,then a vaginal delivery should always be opted for unless there is an indication to do elective c-section earlier like hypertension, breech, genital infection, gestational diabetes. That is my concern here. Keep a watch on the daily fetal movements of the baby, 1 hour after each meal, and the daily count should be more than 10 movements. Go for weekly antenatal visits religiously for examination till delivery.

I have PCOS, high prolactin level, my TSH is 4.26 for which I am taking medicine and for prolactin and my AMH is 17. I got pregnant with twins when I was taking 100 mg of Clomid but there was no heartbeat by week 10. I had a few miscarriages two years ago and I only got pregnant because I was taking Clomid. I cannot get pregnant on my own because I am not ovulating. The next step is either IVF or IUI. Also, when I had my miscarriages two years ago, the doctors never checked my TSH and prolactin levels. So, I think that was the reason for my miscarriage but they did a lot of blood work for everything else and said everything was normal. I am on Cabergoline 0.5 mg and Levothyroxine 0.05 mg. I am taking a medicine for prolactin too. So my issues are high TSH and prolactin and PCOS. I get my periods every two months usually. My AMH is 17 ng/mL, prolactin is 47.23, rubella IgG at 394 IU/mL, free T4 at 1.39 ng/dL, TSH at 4.26, glucose 88 mg/dL, varicella zoster IgG 3.94, homocysteine 7.2 umol/L, and insulin at 9.6. Are there any chances of me getting pregnant?","Doctor":"Hello. I do not see any reason for you to worry or panic. I feel you will not only conceive but also have a healthy baby soon. Let me explain it why I feel so one by one. Nowadays, ladies think of having a baby after the age of 30s. Of course, the age above 35 years is considered a risk factor as the quality of eggs left after 35 years is poor. The age of the oldest mother is 45 years. Many females conceive in their 30s. So, the age factor is ruled out. History of miscarriages - Had you not had any pregnancies till date? In your case, the prognosis is bad. As you have had a pregnancy, you can still surely get pregnant. Remaining are the tests of rubella and varicella etc. They can be forgotten as of now as they point out to only some minor infections. They will not affect the baby. So, if you are having a good ovulation induction with Clomid (Clomifene) and hMG, I suggest you go ahead with the IUI (intrauterine insemination). You will surely get pregnant. But, do not forget to have a good luteal phase with progesterone support. This will improve the implantation. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and take the above medicines with their consent. You also need a lot of positive thoughts, hormonal help and you will surely do great.

I have been experiencing dizzy spells and pulsations in the back of my head. The pulsations are severe when I am sleeping. There are shocks in the head occasionally but more while sleeping.","Doctor":"Hi. We need to do an MRI brain with MRS (spectroscopy), MRA (angiography), MRV (venography), MRI cervical spine with MRA neck vessels with whole spine screening for evaluation of dizzy spells, pulsations in the back of the head. Obesity or overweight can be due to four main causes: 1. Primary genetic insulin resistance. 2. Not doing physical work and being the so-called couch potato (sedentary lifestyle). 3. Diseases related to fat metabolism (dyslipidaemias). 4. Eating too much (also called gluttony). Of these, if your obesity and overweight are due to a sedentary lifestyle, you can reduce your weight and waist circumference by walking, jogging, running, swimming, cardio, lifting weights, etc. If your obesity and overweight are due to eating too much, you can reduce your weight and excess fat by eating less. If your obesity and overweight are due to dyslipidemias, you can reduce your weight and excess fat by appropriate treatment. But, if your obesity and overweight are due to primary genetic insulin resistance, the only way you can reduce weight is by taking a low carbohydrate diet. Running miles on treadmill or starvation will not solve your problem. Before you start low carbohydrate high fat diet, we need to know what all you can take and what all you have to avoid. For this, a series of blood tests are needed. These are available as a package called metabolic profile A. If you have already done this, please send us the reports. If you have not done this, please do it. The technician will come, collect blood and you will get the report the next day by mail."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I got married 15 months back.

How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

Hydrocortisone ointment (topical Clobetasol propionate) is the treatment of choice to reduce scarring and to get relief from fissuring. It will reduce progression of the disease. 3. Avoid scratching and keep the vulva and penis clean and dry. 4.

There is something else I feel when I swallow. It does not hurt but just uncomfortable. It looks black maybe like a pimple or some kind of a bump.","Doctor":"Hello. I went through the picture you sent. (attachment removed to protect patient identity).  The throat, especially the posterior pharyngeal wall and palatine pillars appear a bit congested. Now, this could be due to a few reasons either allergy and repeated throat itch, infection, flu, and acid reflux. There also seems to be minimal post nasal drip. We of course can see the blood clot. It could be due to the removal of the stone and the area could have had mild bleeding which eventually formed the clot. Will you please provide us more details. Is there any allergy symptom runny nose, itch, watering of eyes, sneezing, breathing difficulty, etc? Do you smoke or drink? How many times are you gargling? How are your eating habits? Do you have a fever or weakness? I would suggest if it were just minimal allergy or flu to take an antihistaminic tablet, decongestant or saline nasal spray and a proton pump inhibitor. I would go with Zyrtec and Protonix for a few days. Zyrtec in the evenings and Protonix before breakfast for a week. Avoid spicy and oily diet. Desist from smoking and drinking temporarily.

How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases. Because, it is a volatile compound and causes vapors entering the lungs through the airways. 3. As it was only two drops, I do not think it may cause much trouble.

For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations. If the size and number of cysts are more, then I suggest consulting a gynecologist as you may require surgery.

As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses.

The full story is that about three weeks ago, after a bad breakup, I went to a massage parlor. The parlor was the type that is sort of seedy and known for extras and the masseuse assumed I wanted sex and was immediately ready to go. I sort of talked her down to a handjob and the masseuse took off her clothes, straddled my legs, and did her thing while I lay on my back. For about 10 seconds during the hand-job, her genital area was pressed against my scrotal area, and she also kissed the shaft of my penis twice. There was no intercourse, and I did not see any herpes lesions on her, but I also was not able to look inside her or get more than a few brief looks between her legs before she was on top of me.After the experience, I was very worried about having contracted herpes from the genital contact, so I got some tests done. An IgM plus a full STD screen at three days after the incident, and an IgG and a second IgM at 10 days after the incident. Everything was negative. I have had no symptoms other than a bump on the inside of my thigh, and I have had bumps before in the same spot due to thigh chafing when I walk. I actually had one on the other thigh before the incident. Currently, it is about 22 days after the incident, and I am planning on getting a third IgM done to be extra sure there has been no change. What worries me is that I have read online that the IgM test is unreliable and that 50 % give false negative results. So basically, my questions are, with no symptoms, three negative IgM for HSV 1 and 2, and a negative IgG, is it safe to assume I do not have herpes? Is the IgM completely unreliable or are three negatives taken at different times conclusive? And is it fine to continue with dating and sexual activity given my current circumstances? Or should I abstain from sex completely for another nine weeks and wait till I can take a more accurate IgG? I started a new relationship a couple weeks after the incident, and I do not want to risk infecting her, but I also do not want to ruin the relationship if I do not need to. I also suffer from generalized anxiety disorder. So, any concrete information you have would be helpful. Lately, I have been having especially bad panic attacks and hot flashes. Currently, I am taking Effexor 75 mg.","Doctor":"Hi. I have gone through your case in detail. And after detailed analysis of your contact, it is concluded that you basically are not sure whether the woman actually had any herpes or not. Moreover, all your test results till now are negative. So, in absence of any symptoms of herpes and negative tests both for IgM and IgG, it means you are not having any herpes. So just stay relax.  A false negative is said when you have a clinical lesion of herpes and clinician is quite sure of that but your tests turn out to be negative.In addition to this, if herpes had to appear it would have been evident within 10 to 14 days of your contact. As long as you are herpes free, both clinically and pathologically, you are free to go ahead.

I am suffering from nearsightedness, and I have retinal tears. I consulted several doctors, but I did not get proper answers. The topic of eye floaters is not studied well in my country. My ophthalmologist says that I should do nothing and wait, just have a systematic evaluation of my eyes. I also consulted a laser eye surgeon. He offered me to get LASIK surgery at first, but he also did not give me definite and concise answers. The floaters almost poison my life. I am really close to a depression. My occupation is connected with computers, so I have to work on it for a long time every day. The last time, my eye floaters become more and more bothersome, and it seems to me that their number is gradually increasing. They are of different forms and sizes. I read a lot of information about the possible eye floaters treatment. To be honest, I am afraid of vitrectomy, as it is extremely risky. Laser treatment is more preferable, but I got to know that the patients of my age are not treatable by means of laser procedure. In this case, I have got some questions to ask. What should I do to stop the increasing of my eye floaters? Should I follow my ophthalmologist's advice and do nothing? Are there any successful cases of eye floaters treatment among the patients of my age by laser?

So, the doctor went for a second infusion. There are no other symptoms except for this. Please suggest.","Doctor":"Hello. Firstly, do not panic. Dengue is a self-recovering condition. His platelet counts will gradually rise. Platelet transfusion is fine. Normally, random donor platelets (RDP) increases the platelet count by 5000 only while single donor platelets (SDP) increases it by around 30,000 to 40,000. So, you need to request your local doctor if he can make arrangements for single donor platelets. The next thing is, to increase the platelets, he can take tablet Caripill 1100 mg three times a day for five days which is papaya leaf extract, and it is hypothesized to increase platelets counts. So, you can request a local physician for the same, as there is no harm in having it. Most importantly, the priority is to avoid bleeding till his platelet count rises. So, he should strictly avoid painkillers except for Paracetamol, outdoor activities, brushing, straining at urination and defecation and any activities which may prone him to injury bleeding. He should drink plenty of water and liquids nearly three to four liters a day. His platelet count and hematocrit need to be monitored at least two times a day. Hope this helps you.

I had this hive like rash appear on the top of my right hand only. Has not spread, just gotten a deeper red color. Has some scab like areas I think because I scratched it at first. Does not itch anymore. Have not used any new products or exposed to any allergens. I am aware of to cause this. Again, only on my right hand. This is the fourth day of this rash. Have no idea what it could be from. I have taken Benadryl once daily, it had no effect. Also, have applied Hydrocortisone with no effect. Please help.","Doctor":"Hi. I have gone through your case. In my opinion, you have got an allergic reaction to something like it could be an insect bite or it could be some reaction to wild plants or weeds. It is good that you have used Hydrocortisone and I will recommend you to use it for another week. Apply two times a day for next seven days. And now about brown or black pigmentation. Then remember that it is a natural response of our skin to heal or combat any trauma with hyper or hypopigmentation. In your case, there is hyper pigmenation. Leave it as such right now. Because any creams, if used right now, will start itching and redness. And your lesions are fresh so I do not recommend it right now. Either this will lighten itself with time or if required we will try atleast after 14 days.

How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

I have thoroughly gone through your case and can well understand your genuine health concerns. 1. No, there is not much problem right now as he vomited and also had a lot of water. It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases. Because, it is a volatile compound and causes vapors entering the lungs through the airways. 3. As it was only two drops, I do not think it may cause much trouble.

For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations. If the size and number of cysts are more, then I suggest consulting a gynecologist as you may require surgery.

As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses.

Should I discontinue Nevanac? I have myopia. My power is -3.75 in left eye and -2.75 in the right eye. I have myopia since 20 years.","Doctor":"Hello. No, Nevanac (Nepafenac) does not have such side effects. But, I suggest you reduce the frequency of Nevanac to twice daily after 15 days and then to once at bedtime after next 15 days. You said you are wearing -2.75 in the right and -3.75 in left. This is a spherical error but your prescription shows that along with spherical error you have a cylindrical error too. -0.50 at 60 degrees in right and -0.50 at 14 degrees in left. If that is not incorporated in your glasses please include it because not using cylindrical power along with spherical can cause a headache. If Nevanac does not work in next three to four days you can try Tobramycin plus Fluorometholone eye drop twice daily for seven days. Do not use it for more than seven days. Also, get yourself checked for any near vision error, that is presbyopia.

I have gone through your query and would like to tell you that it is a milk tooth and even if it is removed (due to severe mobility), we can give space maintainer, but I will have to see the X-ray and clinical photo of the tooth to guide you properly. No such serious effect will be there as the permanent tooth will anyways erupt there. An X-ray is definitely necessary to check whether there is any damage to the following permanent tooth within the bone. Secondly, if there is pulp exposure alone, we can do pulpectomy (like RCT) and if just enamel or dentin fracture, we can either smoothen the margins or fill it with tooth-colored cement. As I said, it is just milk tooth that will anyways be replaced by permanent tooth, be totally relaxed.

The symptoms you provided are typical findings of this season. If you have a productive cough which is yellowish or greenish, it indicates a bacterial infection of the respiratory tract. It could be a case of bronchitis and Levofloxacin should work. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and with their consent take the medicines. If not, you could get a culture and sensitivity test of the sputum and switch to another antibiotic according to the report. However, if you have a dry cough, no fever or purulent sputum, it could also be a post-infectious cough or a cough associated with postnasal drip. Also, if you smoke, it can make your cough worse.

As far as small cysts are concerned they are unmatured eggs which failed to induce menstrual cycle previously, as a result, they got collected in the ovary and they will remain in the ovary.

I have gone through your query and the reports attached (attachment removed to protect patient identity). Herpes 1 IgG positive indicates a history of herpes virus type 1 infection which is usually spread by oral contact and causes lesions in the facial region.

I would advise you to visit your local dermatologist for a further clinical examination and any treatment if necessary. Positive VDRL (venereal disease research laboratory) test must be taken with caution as there is a good chance of false positive. As the associated TP (Treponema pallidum) antigen test is negative, it is unlikely that you have syphilis.

I am really scared of the problem. Is there anything to be worried? Help me with this. I am attaching my scan reports here for your reference.","Doctor":"Hi. You are suffering from PCOS (polycystic ovarian syndrome), which is found in 5-10 percentage of general population and there is nothing to worry for it. Your spotting is not related to PCOS directly. In PCOS, periods become irregular due to anovulation, which leads to heavy bleeding due to unopposed estrogen in body. Simple treatment for it is to take combined oral contraceptive pills for regularizing periods before marriage and when you are not trying for pregnancy. It will also prevent ill effects of unopposed estrogen on endometrium. Another option is to induce regular withdrawal by taking Progesterone tablets (Medroxyprogesterone acetate 10 mg twice daily for 5 days) to induce menses every 30-45 days. Spotting should stop once you start oral contraceptive pills, which you can start right now if you are not trying for pregnancy. To prevent long-term ill effects of PCOS, you need to take healthy diet (low carbohydrate, fat, refined sugars and high in fiber content). Do regular exercise for at least 30-45 minutes daily and induce period by oral contraceptive pill and Progesterone tablets regularly. You should avoid gaining weight at all costs as it may impair glucose tolerance and precipitate diabetes in later life. I hope you are taking Iron and vitamin D3 supplements to recover from deficiency.

I am wondering if it is safe to use it for me? I do not have any patches just hair loss and thinning.","Doctor":"Hi. Hair loss occurs due to a variety of reasons. Most commonly at a young age is it occurs due to androgenetic alopecia, it is a type of alopecia due to the sensitivity of our frontal scalp hair to the androgens which increase during puberty. It appears at frontal areas and progressive gradually according to the genetic makeup of a person, in females it is in the central part of the forehead. Other type of alopecia occurs due to chronic illness, chronic stress, chronic drug treatment like chemotherapy and it commence three months after the inciting illness. So to treat it we have to rule out any disease in the body, stop any drug which may be causing their fall if possible. Avoid smoking, alcohol, and do mild exercise. Take a balanced diet and keep yourself stress-free. Medical treatment includes Minoxidil 5% twice daily over the scalp. Tablet Calcium pantothenate and Biotin preparation daily. Rogain also contains Minoxidil. Foam preparation better but costly. This treatment initially is continued for six weeks then we review the progress. In androgenetic alopecia, it has to be continued until you need hair to be normal because genetically those hairs have to be fall. With medical treatment, we are only stopping them. Associated disease or stress should be treated accordingly. Initially due to Minoxidil, there is increased hair fall because the hair which will be weak suddenly fall and strong and dense hair at the place grow which takes time and maximum improvement is seen after eight months of the treatment. Hair loss has multiple factors so try eliminating all in addition to testing your thyroid. I hope this helps."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor,I am trying to conceive but my husband and I did cocaine a week ago. How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

I want to assure you not to worry as everything is going to be fine if proper care and treatment is opted in for. I have thoroughly gone through your case and can well understand your genuine health concerns. 1. No, there is not much problem right now as he vomited and also had a lot of water. It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases. Because, it is a volatile compound and causes vapors entering the lungs through the airways. 3. As it was only two drops, I do not think it may cause much trouble. If he feels short of breath contact me back, otherwise fine. 1. He should avoid re-exposure. 2.

For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations. If the size and number of cysts are more, then I suggest consulting a gynecologist as you may require surgery. If the number and size of cysts are less, you may continue treatment along with syrup Evecare 10 ml BD and Kanchnar Guggulu two BD.

As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses.

Hip labral repairs or excision is done arthroscopically and after that, the surgery for sports hernia can be done either open or endoscopically. So, it can be done in the same sitting of anesthesia. Before the surgery, the clinician should confirm the diagnosis of sports hernia. Has the MRI scan been done?

The results were very good and the anxiety and accompanying depression went away. Now I cannot do anything without medication because the last case happened to me when I had withdrawn the medication (Paxil 10 mg daily for 4 years) and got that relapse, so how can I tune the medications for extended usage? (i.e, which one to cancel or decrease or increase or keep the three but modify the doses) What do you suggest? Please I cannot do without medications? Is it true that the effect of these medications become weak or insignificant with time (i.e, during the usage, work only for limited time then stop working although the person continues to use it).","Doctor":"Hi. At first I would like to tell you briefly about Generalized Anxiety Disorder or GAD that you are already well aware of. This is a chronic, relapsing and debilitating common psychiatric disorder characterized by anxiety and worry about several events and activities for a majority of the day over a 6 months time period. The anxiety and worry associated with GAD can be distinguished from normal anxiety by their excessive nature, the difficulty involved in controlling them, and their interference in everyday life. Having said this I like to emphasize again that it is chronic and relapsing disorder. So if any one needs to discontinue medication it should be done in graded manner. Abrupt discontinuation should be avoided at any cost. You might be aware that every medication has its own side effect and risk benefit, analysis need to be done before every single prescription. In response to your question \\"Is it true that the effect of these medications become weak or insignificant with time?\\" I assure you that with prescribed medication like paxil, the answer is NO. There is no evidence of tolerance with SSRI (Paxil) and wellbutrin. Although such reports you can find in many websites managed by quacks and non medical personnel. I would say it is a MYTH and not a true phenomenon. I hope I have answered your query to a good extent.

For piles (hemorrhoids) the treatment depends on its grade which is assessed well by the surgeon on clinical examination. For grade one - those which bleed without coming out (prolapse) you need only medicines. For grade two or above you need surgery. The standard surgery nowadays is stapler hemorrhoidectomy. This is painless and gives best results. Earlier days open surgery was done but is painful. LASER treatment is almost not done nowadays as it can cause local complications including narrowing of the anal canal. It is highly unsafe and not a good option. Hope your query is cleared.

It seems to me that you have two. The first concerns your use of Tylenol and Advil. You may not have meant to say overdose. If however, you have taken more than 800 mg of Ibuprofen or 1000 mg of Tylenol, those are excessive doses and could be associated with side effects. I would advise you to call the Canadian or US Poison Control Center. They give excellent free advice about overdoses. The second question is in regard to your fever and weight loss. I am not sure how long those things have been going on. With COVID-19 in your area, it is possible this could be your problem. There are many other causes of fever, such as influenza and various other viral and bacterial infections. Often when a fever falls, a person can feel chilled. Some things that you can do besides using Ibuprofen 400 mg up to three times a day or Tylenol 1000 mg three times a day include drinking alit of liquids getting rest and isolating your self from others. Things that would make you want to seek a doctor's care would be increasing cough, trouble breathing, chest pain, trouble thinking clearly or inability to care for yourself. I will pray that you feel better soon.

How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

I have thoroughly gone through your case and can well understand your genuine health concerns. 1. No, there is not much problem right now as he vomited and also had a lot of water. It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases.

For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations.

As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves.

I was told that the formation of cataract was due to side effects of a steroid medicine. When the surgery was done, I did not opt for a progressive lens with cataract lens and power in both the eyes was the same. But, now there is a difference of 0.5 between both the eyes. I am wearing progressive lens with a cylindrical provision. I would like to know whether it is possible to replace my cataract lens with the new one and continue wearing the progressive lens. I have attached my doctor's prescription herewith.","Doctor":"Hello. I have gone through the attachments (attachment removed to protect patient identity). Well, the difference of 0.5 spheres is acceptable in cataract surgery but the problem is the left eye being a plus. Usually, we aim for a postop minus 0.5 in an eye because it will provide some near vision postop. But even with best biometric assessments errors of 0.5 magnitudes occur. It may not be an error because sometimes the lens itself can give rise to a 0.4 error even if your biometry is perfect. Secondly, the right eye cylinder is not due to the power of the lens. Mostly, it is due to the shape of your cornea. Sometimes it may be due to the incision that is necessary for the surgery. Thirdly, the plus lens you need to wear is for the near vision because unlike the natural lens, the artificial one cannot alter its power. The prescription progressive means your specs will be designed to see different distances at different places of specs. Well, there is nothing called a progressive intraocular lens. It is called a multiracial lens. Usually, it is used for young patients because after the age of 40 anyway people lose their ability to see near unless they are myopic. This lens can be used in elderly but for your information, the visual quality is not as good as the normal lenses. Even the best multifocal can accompany patient dissatisfaction and it is very costly. In your case, you can replace the lens for sure. But it is altogether a new surgery. A new cost with an unpredictable outcome. An add-on lens is another option but visual quality with multifocal will be poorer by and large your cataract outcome is favorable and acceptable worldwide. You are sure to have good vision nearly 6/9 without glasses. You will have to use glasses for near. If you wish, you can replace your IOL (intraocular lens). Further, LASIK (laser-assisted in-situ keratomileusis) is also another option for good vision For more information consult an eye care ophthalmologist online -->"},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, My daughter is 10 years old.

You might have taken too much of calcium during your pregnancy, so it might have come out early for him.

The issue is that lately, I have been feeling constantly bloated and full, even if I eat little to no food. If I eat breakfast, it makes me too full and bloated throughout the day and so I had to cut it out of my meals. Currently, I eat two meals a day, lunch and dinner, sometimes a snack in between. I feel fine after eating lunch because I cut back on the amount I was eating but I do still end up feeling bloated a little. But after dinner, I always feel the most bloated and it does not go away the next morning either. I thought it was an irregular bowel movement issue. So, I tried to consume more fiber (like apples) but it did not really help. I just constantly feel bloated, gassy, full, and unable to digest and I have no idea why.","Doctor":"Hello. It may be caused due to the constipation problem. You should do regular exercise or yoga. Take ORS (oral rehydration solution two times in a day). Take a small meal at frequent interval, avoid any spicy food, take soup at breakfast. Take more water (at least 10 glass per day). You can take pineapple juice after lunch. Take half pinch ajwain (carom seeds) after any meal (one time in a day). You should meet a doctor for proper diagnosis.

I would answer your question in the order you asked them. Normal sex life can be resumed six weeks after a cesarean section.

How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations.

As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves.

As of now, we can see that her speech has improved to some extent after the surgery in these five months as well as milk coming out of her nose is not seen from last month. How to know whether we need any surgery or not? We hope she will not require any.

Multiple surgeries in cleft palate children depend upon the extent of the cleft and the age of the child at the time of operation. Only cleft soft palate rarely need another surgery. But, it is quite often that there is an underlying defect of the hard palate as well which is bony. Bony defects might need grafts and may need multiple surgeries. Secondly, in some kids, the cleft palate is associated with a cleft lip which requires another surgery. Any life-saving surgery has to be done early but cosmetic procedures are done later. As your child has only soft palate defect, no further surgery might be required. But, if you can send me the reports, I can suggest you better. Regards.

Right now I am suffering from severe pain intermittently on the right side of pelvic region and right thigh. I am attaching the test reports and prescription herewith. At present I am taking only folic acid tablets and I have not yet started other tablets in the prescription. Kindly advice.","Doctor":"Hello. I have gone through the reports (attachment removed to protect patient identity) and there is definitely a large intramural fibroid in the uterus impinging into the uterine cavity. Ideally this should have been operated upon before your planned conception but nevertheless as you are 7 weeks pregnant, now with a viable fetus and fibroid was an accidental finding during ultrasound so the present management approach would have to be focused on sustaining and preserving the pregnancy further. For info,there are high chances of threatened abortion or placental separation in the early weeks of pregnancy due to such large fibroids, as the pregnancy grows due to inadequate room for growth and fibroid generally not allowing the uterine wall to stretch leading to hemorrhage. Also no operative removal can be attempted now as there can be torrential bleed and chances would be that you may loose your pregnancy.So surgery is out. The management has to be conservative hence with an aim to prevent abnormal uterine contractions with Duvadilan tablet (Isoxsuprine) and progesterone support with Susten SR 400mg daily to allow adequate placentation and trophoblastic growth so that chances of separation are minimized. Immediate aim would be 14 weeks till tablet Duvadilan and Susten would be continued and if the pregnancy grows naturally and crosses 14 weeks, it is a good sign. Also once pregnancy would grow, the fibroid which is estrogen dependent for growth, in the present high progestogenic environment it shall start thinning out by 30 to 40 percent accomodating pregnancy further. Once 14 weeks are crossed then next aim would be 34 weeks as there are high chances of preterm labour and premature rupture of membranes after 24 weeks and before 36 weeks. This is to be watched for and regular obstetric check up would hence be diligently required. So, as of now start tablet Duvadilan and Susten SR without delay and prefer bed rest so as to avoid any bleeding /threatened abortion. Pain is likely to be there .You may use tab Paracetamol only 500mg as and when required for pain relief but in a gap of 8 hours. This is safe in pregnancy . Also hot fomentation for 15 minutes each thrice a day can be helpful. Bed rest is important for the initial 14 weeks. This is a high risk pregnancy due to large fibroid and should be vigilantly dealt under gynaecologist supervision. Any bleeding vaginally should be followed within 6 hours with an ultrasound by your gynaecologist, so be alert on that part. Initial 14 weeks are crucial. Folic acid 5 mg daily, Duvadilan 10 mg thrice a day and tablet Susten SR 400 mg once at night, for 4 weeks. Bed rest ideally till 12 to 14 weeks.

For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations. If the size and number of cysts are more, then I suggest consulting a gynecologist as you may require surgery.

She had taken my blood sample and it was negative. But, still I have not gotten my periods and it has been a week ahead. What could be the reason for my late periods?","Doctor":"Hello. As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses.

Welcome to Icliniq. I will try to answer all your questions one by one. So first of all cylinderical change from -0.75 to -1.25 is not significant and most probably it was due to interobserver variation. Usually refractive error does not change after 20-22 years age and as you are 27 so less chances are that there is any change. 0.5 change can be observed between 2 exams even on same day. so dont worry. If you feel comfortable with glasses then you should wear otherwise this is very small error you will be able to do most of your tasks without glasses. thats upto you. yes, you can use lenses. No, Lasik is not suggested for such a small number. Because even after that you might have error of 0.5. So Don't go for any surgery. You are almost normal even without glasses. change in power already explained above. If you are not comfortable with -1.25 then you should use again go with -0.75. Probably that was your correct preacription. No such diet/food available that corrects refractive error. I hope you i have answered all the questions and haven't missed any. You are most welcome for any further queries. Have a nice day. GOD BLESS YOU"},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I am taking tablet Primolut N 5 mg three times a day for bleeding. I am using it for a short-term period. Once my bleeding stops, I will stop using it. Can I take Primolut N 5 mg along with my regular oral contraceptive pill?","Doctor":"Hi. Primolut N 5 mg (Norethisterone) is a hormonal medication used to delay periods and after stopping it, it can cause withdrawal bleeding within one to two weeks and can cause unscheduled bleeding or irregular periods or spotting. When you are taking oral contraceptives pills along with it, it can affect your menstrual cycles. Both the medications will interact with each other. Oral contraceptive pills are cyclic combined hormonal contraceptives pills that not only provide contraception but, also gives you cyclic bleeding. You can use both medications separately or one medication at a time. Take Primolut N 5 mg twice daily from the day 4 to 24th day or use only combined oral contraceptives cyclically.

Doctor checked McMurray test, and Apley grind test result was negative. Only when I twist (rotate) my knee I hear some clicking or popping sound. I took MRI and the result was shown anterior torn of lateral meniscus. It is very small tear. But, my symptoms are matching with patellofemoral compression syndrome. I am really confused. I am having Glucosamine and fish oil at present. I have attached my MRI report for your reference. Now I am doing swimming and simple knee strengthening exercise. After 2 months rest, I feel free when running continuously. When I rotate my knee, I here click or popping sound and no pain. I ran for 10 days and feel pain at the top of the knee cap. Would you recommend surgery or it will cure naturally? And can I do cycling? Does cycling affect meniscus? Please suggest.","Doctor":"Hi. Thank you for giving me an opportunity to assist you. It looks like you injured your knee three months ago during an athletic activity, and have been having some mechanical symptoms of clicking and popping since then. Since the knee pain has come down, it is likely that your body is trying to take care of the tear for you. While it is often difficult to know from just an MRI report (attachment removed to protect patient identity) as to where exactly the tear is (which zone, etc), it is advisable to consult an orthopedic sports medicine specialist to see if a diagnostic arthroscopy is right for you. This procedure being minimally invasive can allow you to get back to activity very early in the postoperative period. Also, any minor tears and cysts that are causing mechanical obstacle to the normal frictionless movement of your knee joint can be taken care of during the procedure. If the clicking does not bother you much and does not prevent you from athletic activity, I would recommend only strengthening exercise for now. The location that you point out maybe related to a different source of pain. Anterior knee pain is commonly seen in athletes like you with overuse of the patellofemoral joint. 1. Lateral meniscal tear. 2. cyst. 3. Patellofemoral pain syndrome (PFPS). 1. Diagnostic arthroscopy if affecting activity level 2. Physiotherapy supervised quad strengthening.

About two months ago, she started having some swelling in her feet and legs. She waited to see if it would go away, but it did not. Her doctor did some tests and found protein in the urine, so she sent her to a nephrologist. The nephrologist did more tests and found that she has nephrotic syndrome and is going for a kidney biopsy to see what medicine she should take to reverse the damage. I am convinced that it came from birth control pills, because it says in the side effects fluid retention in legs and feet. Has this caused any permanent damage? Is this reversible? The nephrologist said it could not come from the birth control and I disagree. I told my daughter to stop taking this pill as soon as she found out from her interest that there is protein in the urine. She has been off of it for two weeks now.

How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

If you have type I heart block you may have bradycardia despite the presence of other features of anxiety. Any drug that antagonizes autonomic nervous system may be a cause for bradycardia.

Potassium is low that accounts for generalized weakness. So now decrease your food restrictions by 20%. You increase the intake of fruits by one a week. Regarding non-vegetarian diet what you are taking is more than enough because above that it will increase your phosphorus. You can increase the intake of pulses. There are specific books that you can read to cook food for a CKD (chronic kidney disease) diet. You should give maximum focus on salt restriction rather than other things. Chillies can be used as per flavor. THere is no harm. Need to take water in summers and should take at least 1.5 liters of water that is equal to your urine output. In winters, the intake should be slightly less. Medications are all fine. The mainstay to control CKD progression is strict blood pressure control.

As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases.

For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations. If the size and number of cysts are more, then I suggest consulting a gynecologist as you may require surgery.

As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses.

Angioplasty before six months revealed mid right coronary artery stenosis of less than 50% and diffused LAD 20%-30% but no focal stenosis visualized. It also shows large diagonal branch from proximal segment of LAD with stenosis of 60%-70%, left circumflex artery with 30% of stenosis at the ostium and 30%-40% of stenosis on its proximal segment and one large obtuse marginalo visualized without significant stenosis. RCA is large and dominant. In mid distal segment of RCA there is 70% stenosis. There is moderate degree of calcification in proximal RCA. Left ventriculogram showed estimated ejection fraction of 60%-65% with no significant wall motion abnormalities. During angioplasty interventionist was unable to place a stent and said RCA was like cement. Subsequent cardiac calcium scan revealed left main and LAD 1575, LCX 1276, RCA 6589. In pericardium there is no evidence of calcification or effusion. Enlargement of ascending aorta is 4.3 cm. I am asymptomatic. I use to do exercise daily and have a pretty good diet. I do have minor ischemia. I stopped taking calcium supplements after the angioplasty. I take 400 mg of Magnesium glycinate daily, 5000 IU of vitamin D about 4 times a week and 45 mcg of vitamin K2 daily. I use a transdermal Magnesium chloride spray (EASE) on the chest area daily. I am taking a variety of supplements including Omega 3, vitamin C, CLA, L-Camatine, Ubiquinol, Strontium for my senior osteoporosis, Pycnogenol, Mycophyto (combination of 6 mushrooms and garlic). I am also taking medications which include Plavix 75 mg daily, Verapamil ER 300 mg, Simcor 500/20 mg and Aspirin (enteric coated) 81 mg. I have been told by three cardiologists that calcification is irreversible and probably genetic. My questions are, Is cardiac calcification an irreversible condition? Does any significant (and accessible) studies prove that? Whether addition of crystallized Magnesium chloride is helpful for decalcification process? If so what are the other forms of magnesium can I take along with it? Whether oral chelation (EDTA supplements) is safe and effective in decalcification and recommended doses? Do Aspirin and/or Plavix block GLA and cause calcification? I am pleased for your recommendation.","Doctor":"Hi. I assure you not to worry as everything is going to be fine if proper care and treatment is opted in for. I have thoroughly gone through your case and can well understand your genuine health concerns. Cardiac calcification if not yet gone to the level of irreversible stage, can be reversed. But I want to add that we may prevent but not reverse the advanced calcification.  Lot of researches available on this topic, some in favor and some against this school of thought. Dr. Dean in her Book The Magnesium Miracle says \\"Crush a calcium pill and dissolve it in 1 oz of water, some portion will left over undissolved. Now take Magnesium pill, crush and slowly stir it in that water. Miraculously, undissolved calcium will start dissolve. Same happens inside human body\\".  Calcium and magnesium are important parts of the body and coronary vessels also have the same salts in it. Calcium if accumulated, Magnesium salts are used for dissolution of the calcium. Same is true with kidney calcium stones.  Muscle spasms, hardened vessels in cardiovascular system and even weaker bones and dental cavities can occur if you have less magnesium in the body. Magnesium pushes the calcium in bones and teeth and blood is cleared of the toxic effects of the calcium excess. Bone mineral density is actually under the control of magnesium, not calcium.  Very authentic studies have shown all the benefits of the magnesium usage for calcification reduction.  The level of your calcification and the triple vessel disease which you have all made the three cardiologists more justified to say it is irreversible. But let me add that it will stop it here (if not genetic predominant) and further calcification will be lowered. Yes, crystallized Magnesium chloride is beneficial. But should not mix it with other forms of Magnesium. This is a good salt and take it alone if prescribed. But you are already taking a good form and that is Glycinate.  Yes, EDTA (chelation) supplements are effective to some extent. They actually bind to the extra salts including calcium and chelates them and saves body from side effects and toxicities of overload (orally one capsule a day).  No they do not block Gamma-linolenic acid (GLA). There is not much research done and a little data available on this issue. But I usually say that whatever Aspirin/Plavix do to the GLA, they are inevitable and the benefits overweigh the risks. I need some answers, to assist you better.  1. Have you been prescribed Magnesium Chloride (crystallized) and EDTA supplements?  2. Which joints are mainly involved in osteoporosis?  3. What is your lipid profile levels?  4. Are you diabetic and taking medications? But I cannot see about it in the history.  5. How much remains your blood pressure?  6. Do you take some dietary fiber supplement?  7. How much water do you take daily?  In a follow up query, please do answer these.

As you had taken one Unwanted 72 within 24 hours after the intercourse, you must have received a withdrawal bleed after 5-7 days. If yes, then the date of the withdrawal bleed would form your fresh LMP (last menstrual period) and you should be starting your count for next menses from that date. As the pregnancy tests are negative, you are not pregnant from that sexual encounter. Hence, considering the possible withdrawal bleed your next menses should start only by now.

How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves.

Suggest some medicine for abdomen pain and the cyst to resolve. I attached all my reports.","Doctor":"Hello. From your history, you have a right hemorrhagic ovarian cyst, and paraovarian right sided cyst more than 5 cm which increased to this size in one year and surgery advised. This paraovarian cyst (hydatid of Morgagni) epithelium-lined fluid-filled cyst in adnexa adjacent to the fallopian tube. These cysts rarely cause symptoms, and you are having a symptom of pain for which you need treatment. These cysts could become cancerous rarely, can rupture with the fluid spreading in the lower abdomen and can spread inflammation which can involve other organs. A hemorrhagic cyst is bleeding functional ovarian cyst. It can cause pain during sex, pain in lower abdomen, bloating, lower abdominal discomfort. If left untreated, it can rupture and cause abscess formation with sometimes severe sepsis. Torsion cyst is another acute emergency. To prevent this, better to remove it before torsion. Cyst without symptoms resolves itself, but a cyst causing symptoms need intervention before severe consequences and emergencies like torsion, sepsis, etc. (mostly in case of rupture and abscess formation). You have splenomegaly as well. It means, the body systems are also getting affected by the cyst and the body wants to drain it out. I hope you got my point, that is why it is advised to remove the cyst by surgery. Sometimes, it ruptures during surgery, but at that time, the internal organ can easily be cleaned and washed with saline or sterile solutions. It will help to get relief from abdominal pressure symptoms and pain and risk of rupture and abscess and infection. A cyst is normally sent to the lab after removal for histopathology and ruling out cancer. There are few chances of complications in every surgery like internal bleed, postoperative pain or infection, but here those complications are minute as compared to advantages of removal of the cyst. Hope you understand my point.

The left top and bottom wisdom teeth were breaking through the gums. I got sudden pain which was severe in intensity around the back of my mouth and the lower left side. It got aggravated especially on chewing and radiating to the next tooth and along the jaw. The dentist suggested a wait and watch for few days. The next day when the wisdom tooth started to come out, the pain got severely worse over the jaw and the temporomandibular joint. I was unable to tolerate. I cannot even rest my top and bottom teeth together. I got complete numbness on the left side of the chin and lower lip and difficulty in opening my mouth for more than one or two fingers. I could not sleep and felt ill because of the pain. On the X-ray, the wisdom tooth is horizontally impacted, and there were no signs of infection or abscess. The tooth next to the wisdom has a large old filling nearing the pulp. But there are no signs of anything wrong with it on an X-ray. The dentists could not find whether it was the pressure of the impacted tooth on the next tooth or problem with the filled tooth. So, I was just given antibiotics. By the end of the antibiotics, it was slightly better, but I still felt ill. Again, the dentist decided to wait and watch.  As I felt iller than the previous time, I was given another course of different antibiotics. The pain was reduced. But I still have numbness in the chin. However, most of the numbness on the lip has resolved. A constant cramp sensation along the bottom of my jaw and temporomandibular joint with the discomfort temporarily ease with rubbing or stretching or massage. I regained most of my mouth opening back, but it is uncomfortable to open and hold in that position. I also think the jaw discomfort and cramping are worse on the days when I have to talk more. The wisdom tooth and the next tooth are still mildly tender. I can eat soft foods comfortably, but I get pain in the two teeth and the gum surrounding the wisdom tooth on eating hard foods like a raw carrot. The pain will last up to an hour or more. I have never had any hot or cold sensitivity or nasty taste in my mouth. The dentist I saw thinks that it is because of the nerves from the filled tooth and wants to do root canal treatment or extraction. How would this change any of the nerve or temporomandibular joint pain? I am worried that if the impacted tooth's pressure is causing the pain, then it will make no difference anyway.

When I was on a trip before two years where out of nowhere my saliva started building up so much that I needed to swallow it every 30 seconds. The issue would go away when I was distracted, but it has been really bothering my life for the past two years. When I have to swallow the saliva, I do not enjoy it in the slightest. It is very annoying for me. I have visited a psychotherapist for this, but they said they had never seen anyone with my issue before, despite being a cognitive behavior therapy center. I have had anxiety from this, but the anxiety has only been from thinking that this saliva will keep on building up in my mouth. I did a lot of research and saw that one of the salivary glands is capable of producing five times the normal amount of saliva or something like that, which I think is causing this. It is important to note that the excess of saliva buildup is not always there. It usually goes away when I am really distracted. When I am doing nothing I find that it really builds up and I cannot stop the excess saliva build up. Could that have something to do with the parasympathetic nervous system? Because, I have heard that it is responsible for stimulation when the body is at rest. Last week, I visited my physiotherapist for something in my arm and they also told me I was very hyperaware. I was wondering if this had something to do with it. Regardless, I also found something showing that people with excess saliva have one of their glands removed and that can help a lot.

What are the other channels for the entry of virus into the body apart from sex? If wife and husband both are virgin at the time of marriage and are sincere after marriage, is there any chance of getting cervical cancer?","Doctor":"Hello. Cervical cancer is caused principally by two strains of HPV (human papillomavirus) - 16 and 18. Though there are more than 400 serotypes present but only 144 have been identified till date and of these high risk types being 16, 18, 31, 33, 34, 45, 52, and 58 which constitute 90% of cervical cancer cases. HPV commonly spreads through vaginal or anal sex. It can also pass when the infected person has no signs or symptoms. Though you have been sexually active with only one person, you can get HPV. Even a mere skin to skin contact with a HPV infected person can spread HPV. But the fact is, unless the above mentioned strains are not detected on HPV DNA studies during pap smear, it is unlikely that you shall get cervical cancer. Even if both of you are virgin and do not have HPV still if you do not have the high risk strains, you may have other strains of HPV as commensals which with regular sex often can undergo mutation and beget high risk strains. So, the best is to get a HPV vaccination done before you undertake sexual activity ideally, else as per guidelines HPV vaccination should be given to all women between 9-45 age group irrespective of their sexual activity status.

It is good that you are concerned regarding your husband with a positive family history. We should be alert for any conditions if they are running in the family. As per you, your husband has multiple gastric problems with back pain and numbness. These problems may be due to indigestion and less physical work up. It is very common in these lockdown days. The alarming issue is he has blood in stool that cannot be ignored. It may be due to hemorrhoids but complete checkup is necessary. I will advise you some medicines and blood investigation that should be done as early as possible. Avoid spicy and fatty diet and water intake should be adequate. Start some physical workup like cardio on treadmill if not possible to go outside. Regular habit of walking after ever meal will help. Get back to me any time after investigation. Gastric upset with bleeding PR (rectal bleeding). Colonoscopy with biopsy. Ultrasound whole abdomen abdomen and pelvis. Complete hemogram with LFT (liver function test), KFT (kidney function test), and blood sugar. Syrup Cremaffin four teaspoons at bedtime for seven days.

If he had a heart attack, then it is better to shift him to a higher center with facility for cardiac care like angiography is available. He will need further management like echocardiography, angiography, and stenting if significant blockages are there. Also, medical treatment needs to be optimized. Enquire if troponin test is positive or not. I also want to know his CK-MB levels, which indicate heart damage.

I am currently experiencing shortness of breath (no coughing) and excessive burping. I will try to provide you as much detail as possible. When I went, I did not have any symptoms. Three months had passed with no problem. Then I slowly started to become tired while working out and eventually at the five-month mark I was exhausted. The main symptoms I had were fatigue (unable to exercise at all), shortness of breath, pain/discomfort in the upper back, and excessive burping. Now after returning (been back for two weeks), I only have shortness of breath and burping. I still feel some discomfort in upper back but not as severe. I went to the ER and got a chest X-ray and blood work (I have listed the tests), all came back fine. So as of now I do not know what to think and I am debating whether to return there as it is known for its high pollution rate in most cities, and at times it seemed that my symptoms fluctuated with the pollution level. I do not know what to think about the shortness of breath. It feels as though I need to take deeper breaths. I am able to exercise again though. I am currently using Omeprazole for the burping. I have been using it for almost two weeks and it is not helping at all. I also have antacid and digestive enzymes that I use occasionally. What are your suggestions for tests I should take or in general? I honestly want to know if it would be a good idea to return given the information I have provided. Thanks for your help.","Doctor":"Hello. In case all your investigations are normal then you probably have acute bronchitis or associated anxiety. In your case scenario, my suggestion would be antiallergic like Levocetirizine and Montelukast once daily. Addition of Etizolam as an antianxiety drug would help you further. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines with their consent. I hope it helps you.

I had sex on Saturday afternoon. Today is my last day of OCP cycle. I found little brownish discharge this morning. I am worried. 1. What could be the cause for this spotting? 2. If I take another i-pill today would it be helpful for me or worsen the matter? Please suggest what to do.","Doctor":"Hi. I have read and understood your problem. I am really concerned about your anxiety. Normally, there is no chance of getting pregnancy. But, you have taken 12 OCPs in six days Wednesday to Monday and one i-pill too.  Due to the excessive dosing, there is spotting. Even if you do not want pregnancy taking another i-pill today will not help you. Today is your last day of OCP, so in next few days you will get a normal bleeding/menstruation. After which you can use a progesterone containing intrauterine contraceptive device (IUCD) inserted by a gynaecologist. Also I understand that you have excessive anxiety and fear of pregnancy. So, I suggest you should consider counseling by a psychiatrist/psychologist. But be assured that you are fine and do not take unnecessary extra doses, because one OCP daily is enough.

How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases.

For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations. If the size and number of cysts are more, then I suggest consulting a gynecologist as you may require surgery.

She had taken my blood sample and it was negative. But, still I have not gotten my periods and it has been a week ahead. What could be the reason for my late periods?","Doctor":"Hello. As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses.

This has started since four years on a yearly basis to a daily basis since six months. I have been seeing an ent consultant but due to COVID-19, I am unable to see him until August. I had recent blood tests and MRI which came back all clear. I had an endoscopic examination that said there was some crusting on the left side and rest all fine believing it is posterior and not anterior epistaxis. This is affecting the quality of my life. I have also developed bruxism and ETD with blocked ears now and then. I have also got gingivitis as well. No hayfever or allergies I am aware of. I have had suspected sinusitis but this was not confirmed. But every day, I have a watery eye, especially on the right eye.","Doctor":"Hello,  Welcome to icliniq.com.  You have recurrent epistaxis and you have been cauterized also a number of times. There does not seem to be any obvious pathology on examination by endoscopy. I must point out that epistaxis can be idiopathic in more than 50% patients. This is because certain patients tend to have nasal mucosa far more friable than others and susceptible to even most trivial trauma like nose picking or forceful blowing. Even minor colds can cause epistaxis. However, one has to be careful to rule out other causes. Hypertension is an important cause but that is usually an affliction of elderly. At your age, one would like to rule out bleeding diathesis. Did you ever have bleeding from any other site? Have you done a coagulation profile, though you have mentioned blood tests? What about liver and renal function tests? Are you on any medication other than this? Further deviated nasal septum with spurs can cause epistaxis. Did MRI mention anything like that? In case there is nothing to suggest any underlying cause, it is likely to be idiopathic. And role of precautions become all that necessary. One important thing is to prevent your nose from becoming dry as occurs in dry weather and colds. You can use liquid paraffin nasal drops to prevent mucosa from becoming dry and friable. Further you need to avoid blowing hard or frequent cleaning of nose. You can also use topical decongestants like Xylometazoline 0.02% if you develop a bleed. Avoid using them for more than seven days at stretch. You can go for a CT (computed tomography) nose and PNS (para nasal sinus) for having a better information on sinus details."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I was prescribed Etizolam 0.5 mg and Escitalopram for a month, as I had insomnia, stress, and anxiety. However, during the last week, it did not seem to work.

Other than vitamins and prostate-related herbs, I take no medication. I have no allergies and have never smoked. My past medical or surgical history is rather unremarkable. I have had several bouts of acute sinusitis in years past. Four weeks ago, my wife and I developed URTI. My illness had a sinus component featuring marked nasal and sinus congestion, postnasal drip, upper airway congestion and cough productive of clear sputum. I assumed the etiology was viral and treated it as such. After two weeks of little improvement, I assumed a bacterial etiology and initiated Augmentin 875 mg bid. After five days with little improvement, I switched to Cipro 500 mg bid. After four days, I saw my primary care doctor who prescribed Azithromycin 500 mg per day. Following the second day of treatment, I developed severe fatigue, generalized weakness and headache, which forced me to discontinue the Azithromycin. I then decided to wait until the Zithromax cleared my system before re-evaluating. After some eight days, I developed a purulent nasal discharge for which I again saw my primary care MD who prescribed Doxycycline 100 mg bid. Note that I requested a culture and sensitivity of the purulent discharge but was rebuffed. After 24 hours on Doxycycline, I felt greatly improved with little sinus pressure or congestion and minimal, clear nasal discharge. Now, on day four of Doxycycline, I have noted some return of the sinus pressure, post-nasal drip and nasal congestion. However, the mucus is clear. I was given a steroid nasal spray which only served to increase the mucosal irritation of my sinuses, nasal passages, throat and upper airways. I was never febrile at any point.

You are suffering from chronic sinusitis. And I feel this is all allergic and you do not need antibiotics. Usually an acute attack takes five days to settle down. But, if you have persisting sinusitis, you would require CT paranasal sinuses. If the CT shows slight sinus infection, then it can be treated with conservative treatment. But, if the infection is severe, you would require surgery for the same.

I never felt any dizziness or spinning of head. I just had a feeling that I will fall down. I consulted a doctor and he told me that it was due to vitamin B12 deficiency and also prescribed me few shots of Vitcofol. Initially, I felt a lot better after taking them and I took them for one year at reducing frequency. Though I was not completely out of the problem, doctor asked me to stop taking those shots. Now, the same problem has got back after a gap of three years. But now along with problem of unbalancing I am having weakness, palpitation and uneasiness in stomach as well as having sore mouth. Four months back, I have consulted a cardiologist. He ran few tests such as ECG, echo and TMT. My heartbeat was low at 48 bpm. No problem was detected in angiogram and no blockage was present. Doctor suggested me Orcibest 10 and Tonact ASP for low pulse rate. I was referred to a neurologist. He carried out MRI of brain and spinal cord. No abnormality was detected in either of them. My vitamin B12 was found to be 507 pg/ml. Based on my history three years back; doctor gave me vitamin B12 (Methylcobalamine) shots in spite of the vitamin B12 level being normal. After taking them I am comparatively feeling better and there is improvement in my walking. There is no uneasiness in heart as well in stomach; sore mouth has all improved drastically. After ten weekly shots and doctor reduced the frequency to one per month. But after a couple of weeks again I began to feel weak. A month back, the doctor again put me back on weekly shots of vitamin B12. My present condition is that, my energy level has improved but only slightly. The problem of unbalancing has improved but still far from normal. With shoes on, I find it very difficult to walk. With sandals and slippers I feel little easier to walk. I am still taking vitamin B12 shots. For low pulse rate, I am taking Orcibest 10 and Tonact ASP as prescribed by the cardiologist.

For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations. If the size and number of cysts are more, then I suggest consulting a gynecologist as you may require surgery.

As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses.

But, one of my breasts has become significantly larger than my other breast. Should I be concerned? Should I see a gynecologist?","Doctor":"Hello. If, like you said, one of your breasts is significantly larger than the other, then definitely you should consult a gynecologist for a clinical examination and if required, get a sonography, mammography and also some blood tests like prolactin level done. Generally, at around 12 weeks of pregnancy, the breasts can start secreting milk. So, if you had an abortion and secretions had started coming, we may need to suppress the secretion with medicines. Remember the following: Though the reasons may be varied, a clinical examination and prolactin level test along with sonography will be enough to arrive at a diagnosis as well as give us clarity on the treatment plan. Let me tell you that a slight difference in size is normal though. And if a lump is suspected, it may need to be surgically removed. Basically, the final management depends on the reports and clinical examination.

For constipation, you might consider talking green vegetables and salad and at least 10 glass of water per day. Also, for constipation, bulk laxatives can be taken.

How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

I began to struggle with daily gout pain a few months ago and finally gave in to taking the traditional drugs about one and a half months ago. Both allopurinol and probenecid caused worrisome impacts on my body. I began to experience flank pain, confused thinking, and fatigue. Around this time, I was also compelled to have my A1C checked because I was struggling with headaches, insomnia, and various degrees of itching after eating. My A1C turned out to be 5.7. I stopped taking the drugs, and did a lot of research, and was fortunate to find some supplements that seem to be effective at the intersection of both metabolic syndrome and gout. Presently, I have found that Berberine (approximately 1000mg/day) works. Gout pain is essentially gone, and blood sugar seems to be coming under control with each day, though my caloric intake in unsustainably low. Admittedly, I have taken some hesperidin, ALA, chromium, NAC, ECGC, nigella sativa oil, or triple strength turmeric occasioanally if I was having a momentary concern (not all at once), or even all in a day, but occasionally. My concern is for my ongoing liver function. Though things seem to be getting better, as the day goes on and I have taken some supplements, I will start to feel pressure in the middle of my back, kidney area, and left flank discomfort. It tends to have gone away by the time I wake up in the morning. On looking at my labs, the markers for liver function have fluctuated, but my primary care doctor never made mention of them. Is there anything you can tell me about what the changes in these ratios say?","Doctor":"Hi. I have seen your blood works. (attachment removed to protect patient identity). It is all normal. Usually, during the acute attack of gout, we do not start Allopurinol or uric acid decreasing medications as it can exaggerate the situation. We usually start after the acute situation is treated with drugs like NSAIDs (non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs). Allopurinol is started with caution if there is liver disease, kidney disease, diabetes, congestive heart failure, and high blood pressure. Are you pregnant or breastfeeding? Are you receiving chemotherapy drugs? Allopurinol can decrease the number of blood cells in your body that causes blood clot and that help you fight infections, which can make it easier for you to bleed from an injury or get sick when exposed to others who are ill. It can increase liver enzymes to decrease the blood elements. But I have seen your blood works and it is fine. If someone has kidney stones due to increased uric acid, or recurrent gout episodes, or uric acid deposition on soft tissues that is the time usually Allopurinol is started and continued I think you do not have these problems. You need to decrease your protein intake like less meats, fish, lentils, eggs, and avoid diuretics which are used to treat high blood pressure. Alcohol intake to be reduced as well. You told your HBA1c (glycated hemoglobin) is 5.7 that is pre-diabetes or borderline diabetes, so better check your fasting sugar and sugar after two hours of eating. You need to do exercise even if it is just walking for one hour daily. Stop or reduce carbohydrates especially sugar in tea and sugary juices, bread, rice, pasta, and potatoes. Intermittent fasting can also help in decreasing weight and controlling sugar. Lifestyle modifications can help a lot in your case.

She is running into 18 weeks and five days as of today. No history of any fertility treatment ever. Last week, she had bleeding with clots and tissues (one pad soaked each time) twice in four days interval. We consulted a local doctor and had a 4D ultrasound scan. The fetus is without anomaly but she has low-lying placenta covering the os and a 14x8 mm retroplacental clot was observed. She also has cervical polyp but the local doctor observed bleeding is not due to the polyp. Along with total bed rest, the local doctor prescribed the following:  Injection Proluton (once so far), Tablet Miprogen 200 mg twice a day for five days. Tablet Texakind 500 mg thrice a day for five days. Tablet Duvaldin retard twice a day. She has a tendency of sinus and recently had cough. Hence, the doctor prescribed antibiotics also.  Questions:  She is still bleeding, though lesser in quantity (maybe 20-30 drops). Is the above medication enough? Do you recommend any change? Is this officially placenta previa situation? We want to fly back home on the 25th having one and a half hours flight journey. Is this safe? I read contradictory views on cabin pressure factor. Are coughing and sneezing creating jerks contributing to bleeding? Since last USG mentioned \\"covering the os\\", does it mean there is a very slim chance of placenta moving away from cervix os in the coming weeks? Is this small but frequent bleeding fatal to the fetus? How to determine if it is time for blood transfusion?  Sorry for the long post. This is our first time and we are very anxious due to ongoing issues. Please guide us. Thanks.","Doctor":"Hello. Yes, the above medication will be effective and safe. The minimal bleeding will also settle down soon. Since it has been detected by scan, then definitely it is placenta previa. At this point of time, it is better to avoid journey as it may increase the amount of bleeding. The placenta will definitely move up slowly as the pregnancy advances. Since the bleeding has reduced, it will not have any fatal effects on the baby.

I have never had any issues like this before and worried that the hair will not grow back. Is there anything I can do? I am currently taking Hydrocortisone for dermatitis in private area.","Doctor":"Hello. I can understand your concern. According to your statement, you have alopecia on beard. It has been there for the last few months and you are on medication like Hydrocortisone for dermatitis. You may be suffered from alopecia areata which is a peculiar form of hair loss that usually affects the scalp but can occur on any hair-bearing skin like your beard. For most patients the condition resolves without treatment within a year but the hair loss is sometimes permanent. The cause of alopecia areata is probably an autoimmune reaction. This means the body's immune system incorrectly attacks the body's own cells. In case of alopecia areata, the cells under attack are in the hair follicles (structure that grow hair), especially follicles within hair-bearing skin. Alopecia Areata can be resulted from autoimmune disorders such as atopy, allergy, thyroiditis, vitiligo, etc. Even some studies show that stress, family history of alopecia, vitamin deficiency like Biotin, Vitamin A, C, D, E, etc., nutritional deficiency like iron, zinc, protein, etc., can also cause alopecia areata. For the treatment of alopecia areata, you can use Intralesional corticosteroid injections, topical Minoxidil, Anthralin cream or ointment, and topical corticosteroids. By using any of the above-mentioned medication and taking vitamin and nutrition that are mentioned above, you can get rid of alopecia areata within some months."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor,I am trying to conceive but my husband and I did cocaine a week ago.

But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

He vomited and had lot of salt water. Please advice for any side effect.","Doctor":"Hi. I want to assure you not to worry as everything is going to be fine if proper care and treatment is opted in for. I have thoroughly gone through your case and can well understand your genuine health concerns. 1. No, there is not much problem right now as he vomited and also had a lot of water. It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases. Because, it is a volatile compound and causes vapors entering the lungs through the airways. 3. As it was only two drops, I do not think it may cause much trouble. If he feels short of breath contact me back, otherwise fine. 1. He should avoid re-exposure. 2.

For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations. If the size and number of cysts are more, then I suggest consulting a gynecologist as you may require surgery.

As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses.

Getting treated by a doctor with medicines. But I do not feel completely good. Many times I go into very sad mood. Please give me suggestions.","Doctor":"Hi, Thanks for writing to us. Your answer is as follows: OCD is manageable with the help of regular psychiatric and therapeutic work. Only medicines can never treat OCD, neither managed completely. Cognitive Behavior Therapy (CBT) is paired with medical treatment to deal with obsessions and compulsions simultaneously. Medications are only used to decrease the extreme symptoms of anxiety (because of obsessions); and once they are controlled, CBT has to be immediately started for the person. CBT is mainly used to teach the skills to the person and guide him/her to control his/her obsessions and manage compulsions (behaviors) linked with thoughts. So, you are advised to consult a CBT-therapist near you and take regular sessions to learn certain techniques including ERP(Exposure and Response Prevention), Relaxation Therapy, DIET and sleep management. Alternatively you can book for an online therapy at icliniq, and we will help you with this as well. Hope it helps."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I herewith attach the medical reports of my son aged 17 years old who had pancreas problem. He does not have any bad habits.

To explain you the report in plain language, first of all, let me tell you that the dual marker test is just a screening test for Down's syndrome and other chromosomal anomalies like trisomy 13/18.

How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density.

Two weeks ago, I had flu symptoms, like headaches, body aches, low fever, chest tightness, and shortness of breath. The chest symptoms were there straight away, and my asthma medicines (Symbicort and Ventolin) were not working from the start. I was taking 200 mg Symbicort twice daily, and Ventolin every three hours or so. After a weekend of being short of breath and tight-chested, I was on my way to my GP just to run my symptoms by him to see if I needed a GP or ER. He told me to take 12 puffs of Ventolin and go straight to the ER. The ER did ECG, chest x-ray, and blood tests. They gave me a nebulizer and Prednisone 50 mg and sent me on my way. I was still short of breath. My chest x-ray was clear, and my blood showed no infection. I did not have any improvement for the week, and I was taking Prednisone, Symbicort, and Ventolin every 2 to 3 hours. I was short of breath all week. I went to another GP, who sent me straight to the ER again. An intern took my history, after three hours of waiting with chest tightness, shortness of breath, mild intermittent sharp chest pain, and lifelong asthma, etc. I also explained that I am a non-wheezing asthmatic, and when I feel at my worst nothing can ever be heard on my chest. Interestingly, he only noted intermittent sharp chest pain not worse on deep inspiration. He did not note chest tightness when breathing. I also told them that for the 10 days, I had coughed more at night but the shortness of breath decreased overnight every night and was gone in the morning and then just gradually increased over the day until it was sober. Then the registrar came and told me that I was to be sent home, as I was taking too much medication and that was causing my heart to race, and that is why I had shortness of breath. I explained that I had shortness of breath before taking lots of medicines and that was why my physician sent me to the hospital the previous day. I did not even know that I could take it more than my usual two puffs every four hours. I was taking medicines as per my brand new asthma plan, which was given to me by my GP. I asked him \\"was my heart rate high when the intern tested me?\\" To this, he answered, \\"I do not know, and I have not looked.\\" Then he took my pulse for about three seconds with no watch and said it was 100 per minutes, but my heart rate has been tested over and over all week and was normal every time, that is why I challenged him. He then said that he would keep me in overnight for observations and to await a blood test for a blood clot. The intern had told me they would be doing an ECG and lung function tests. They put me in a room with about eight recliner chairs and no blanket. The nurse attended to everyone else in that room all night and did not even look at me once. She just ignored me. She did not even come close to me. I was awake most of the night. I could hear everything she did with the other patients. My breathing settled a little, but it was still labored all night, and I was coughing all night. They would not let me have my asthma medication. I felt hot and then cold, and I had a migraine. I felt so unwell that I could not get up to reach the button and was just waiting for her to come and help me so that I could tell her. At handover in the morning, she told the next nurse all my information loudly until she came to the bit where she whispered to him that I had been fine all night. I could not believe it. I managed to get some Panadol out of the new nurse, as he did my observation at 7 AM. Then the morning doctor, a young boy, told me he was sending me home, as I was better. I said that my shortness of breath was slowly returning with movement, as I told the doctors at night would happen. He said with asthma; I would be better off being at home as if I caught one of the nasty bugs in there things would get way worse. He said \\"you do not look like you are dying, and that is my job to see if you look like you are dying. And if you do not, then you are sent home\\". They never gave me an ECG, and they never gave me lung function tests. My discharge report simply stated that I should go home and take my Ventolin if severely short of breath with wheezing. They made up their minds that I was just taking too many medicines or that I had a 10-day long panic attack. My GP asked me if I had been put on any antibiotics, and I told her how the ER said I had no infection. The GP said, but how did they know if they only took blood? She told me that the hospital tests would not show up a chest infection. So she put me on five days of Augmentin, and the headache is gone now and asthma slightly better, but I still feel tightness and short of breath. I have been sitting for an hour and a half and am breathing like I have been on a long walk. This has really scared me. The only message I got from the ER says that do not go there even if you have serious symptoms. I have been sent there by doctors. I have not been believed about my asthma all my life, as I never have a wheeze and since menopause, my asthma has gone from mild to sometimes really bad. Home GP was worried about respiratory alkalosis, as I had been hyperventilating for 10 days. I told the intern and registrar what the GP was concerned about, and they just shrugged like it was unimportant. When I read my discharge summary, I saw my bicarbonate level is low, which indicates the possibility of respiratory alkalosis, does not it? And my eGFR level was low also, which indicates the possibility of a problem with my kidneys. The doctors told me none of this. I am being treated for low vitamin B12 and tested for anemia at the moment by my GP. I would like a second opinion as none of this is making any sense to me, and I am still pretty much just as breathless and just as tight chested when I breath. Between ER doctors and GPs, I have nowhere else to turn. I am now taking Symbicort and Ventolin.","Doctor":"Hello. I am sorry for your trouble.

The pain persisted after I finished the course of antibiotics and so the dentist again prescribed a five day antibiotic course. A week went by with no pain and then the pain re-occurred. My medical doctor prescribed a third course of antibiotics now. I fear that there is an infection under the gum line that is not being addressed by the antibiotics. Since I started the latest course of antibiotics, the pain is on and off. When I have the pain, it bounces around even to the head. I feel there may be some nerve damage when the tooth was pulled. I am taking Clindamycin for this issue. Also, I am on Insulin for type 1 diabetes, Cyclobenzaprine, Levothyroxine and Lisinopril. My regular dentist wants me to see an endodontist, on the theory that one of the neighboring teeth is infected and their solution is to do a root canal. I hear that the root canals are a bad idea as a dead tooth is left in place to seep bacteria into the body. If possible, Can I get an antibiotic injection at the site of the infection? Please give me your thoughts. Thank you.","Doctor":"Hi. I can understand your concern regarding to dental health. For further information consult a dentist online -->"},{"Patient":"Ten days ago, I was eating some soup when some got under my tongue and I felt a sudden sour twang through the right side of my mouth and jaw. It gradually subsided in intensity and I examined the inside of my mouth for any tender areas or asymmetries under my tongue. There was a very slight swelling of my submandibular duct on the right side, but no tenderness or anything strange palpable. Later that night, I was eating some chips when I noticed rapidly increasing discomfort in my right jaw, earache, and pain when swallowing. I felt my throat and discovered a golfball-sized swelling under my right jaw. On the advice of my father (who said it sounded like a blocked salivary gland, and said he recently had one as well), I used warm salt rinses and external warm compresses. Within a short period of time, the swelling reduced by about half, and with repeated rinses, gradually reduced over the next day until it was minimal.  Since then, I have still had a palpable asymmetry when feeling both sides of my jaw, and my submandibular gland has not returned to its ordinary size. Last night, I felt discomfort in that area and realized on examination that it was beginning to swell again. I quickly used more salt rinses and a compress, and the swelling stopped, but it remains a bit more enlarged than it has been over the past few days. This morning, it seems to be fluctuating slightly in size, but I hit it with more salt rinses and compresses and it appears to be stable for now, though with a slight referred earache.  The submandibular duct has not seemed particularly swollen since shortly after the first day of symptoms, when I noticed a small white spot forming at the head of the duct, which disappeared shortly after using salt rinses. I infer that this may have been a very small salivary stone pushing its way out. I have been eating and drinking somewhat infrequently for the past few weeks due to a major housing disruption that has only recently been resolved, so it's my hope that, due to a combination of dehydration and infrequent stimulation of the salivary glands, I may simply have developed some small salivary stones that could resolve on their own if I am diligent with salt rinses and compresses.  At no point have I had any sort of fever or foul taste in the mouth, nor any symptoms in any other salivary gland besides my right submandibular gland. I also recall eating some hard, sharp food 10-11 days ago that had cut my gums here and there through miscalculated bites, so it also seems possible that I traumatized the duct at that time, although it's strange to me that swelling would be recurring now after relative reduction of symptoms for over a week (though as I noted, the gland has never fully returned to a non-palpable size even at its best).  I suppose it must sound like I've self-assessed the situation reasonably well, but due to the recent resurgence of symptoms (which I confess may be due to getting lax with salt rinses or proper hydration), I just wanted to seek some qualified medical advice as to whether I'm doing the right things so far, and at what point I should seek treatment if it doesn't completely subside. The only local ENT is not available by referral for 6-10 months, so my only alternative would be to go to the ER for assessment or attempt to find a general practitioner in the area (we just moved here, so we had to leave our old GP behind). Both options are bad for exposure, given the current pandemic, and my wife is a very high risk individual, so I'm doing my best to limit exposure unless I can't help it.  Thank you for listening, and for any advice you can lend!","Doctor":"Hi! You have assessed the condition in the best manner any patient could do! So considering the problem out there, like you have rightly put it , looks like we are dealing with an infected gland/ sialolith or a traumatised duct. In all three cases, I suggest you to follow the advice mentioned below 1. Hydration is the key, keep drinking 5 to 6 litres of boiled warm water every day whether your thirsty or not. 2. Salt water gargles @8 to 10 times a day for 1 month will definetly go a long way 3. You can consider antibiotic clindamycin 300 MG three times a day for 5 days. This antibiotic has the property of getting excreted majorly through the salive and majorly reaches the salivary glands a shade more than other antibiotics. 4. Please eat on time, spicy, oily and junk food have to be avoided at all times for the next one month. 5. An ultrasound of the glands is definitely mandatory to see if there is any Impacted stone, parenchymal issue etc, but to be done only once the pandemic subsides. (Considering that you shouldn't be going to hospital for risk of acquiring an infection) 6. This will take a while for it to subside, but chiefly depends on how much you happen to follow the above advice! Hope this helps, get well soon!"},{"Patient":"Hello doctor,I am trying to conceive but my husband and I did cocaine a week ago. How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

He vomited and had lot of salt water. Please advice for any side effect.","Doctor":"Hi. I want to assure you not to worry as everything is going to be fine if proper care and treatment is opted in for. I have thoroughly gone through your case and can well understand your genuine health concerns. 1. No, there is not much problem right now as he vomited and also had a lot of water. It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases. Because, it is a volatile compound and causes vapors entering the lungs through the airways. 3. As it was only two drops, I do not think it may cause much trouble. If he feels short of breath contact me back, otherwise fine. 1. He should avoid re-exposure. 2. Rule out if there is some sort of suicidal ideation due to depression or anxiety and take him to a psychiatrist for physical evaluation.

For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations. If the size and number of cysts are more, then I suggest consulting a gynecologist as you may require surgery. If the number and size of cysts are less, you may continue treatment along with syrup Evecare 10 ml BD and Kanchnar Guggulu two BD.

She had taken my blood sample and it was negative. But, still I have not gotten my periods and it has been a week ahead. What could be the reason for my late periods?","Doctor":"Hello. As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses.

However, I constantly have thick post nasal drip mucus that covers my vocal chords and makes my voice very weak all the time. My nose has not felt 100 % open in years. Also, I have trouble hearing because of trapped fluid in my ears. Does this mean I could have rhinitis on top of my allergies? I am a singer and used to have a very loud resonant voice and now I struggle to even achieve even a portion of that resonance. Currently, I am doing saline cleanse.","Doctor":"Hi. Your symptoms point towards chronic rhinosinusitis superimposed or worsened by allergy. All symptoms can be explained by this. Singers are more troubled by this condition because they require clear sinonasal cavities for good voice and resonance. I suggest you get some investigations done and I will tell you why. Complete blood count to detect any infection. Total serum IgE to check for allergy (type 1 hypersensitivity or atopy). Non-contrast CT (computed tomography) scan of paranasal sinuses to check for sinus inflammation or fungus or any other condition inside sinuses causing constant secretion of mucus and post nasal drip. A laryngoscopy can also be done to throw some light into the vocal cord and understand if there is any local pathology in vocal cord secondary to the sinus disease or de novo. If you were to come to me, in addition to the above advice I would start you on the following medicines. An intranasal steroid spray to be taken twice daily in each nasal cavity. An antihistaminic with Montelukast combination taken once daily. A Mucolite medicine to help lighten the mucus and bring it out better. An antacid medicine like Protonix (Pantoprazole) to reduce acid secretion in the stomach and also reflux laryngitis due to it. Lastly, some dietary and lifestyle modifications will also be required. Desist from gargles and steam inhalation.  For more information consult an allergy specialist online -->"},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am a 54 year old female. I was taking Raciper plus for 15 days.

So, in the case the person's blood was on the blade, it would have dried in 15 minutes. Hence it is less likely that the HIV would survive. In spite of all this, I would say precaution is the best. Always ask the barber to use a new blade. Also, the chances of getting a Hepatitis B and C infection are higher than that of an HIV. To prevent this, I suggest getting a Hepatitis B vaccine. Please consult your local clinic in case you experience any unexplained and non-recovering fever. If you are still worried, consult your local clinic and get an HIV test done after one to three months.

My wife had an embryo transfer before 15 days. She took Ovidrel trigger shot before two days of embryo transfer. Then, she took Triptorelin injection one day after transfer and another injection seven days after transfer. On the seventh day, before taking Triptorelin injection, we went for a beta hCG test, and the value was 46. Does Triptorelin injection of 0.1 mg give the false positive result? Will Triptorelin produce hCG?","Doctor":"Hi.

But, after that, she did not have her periods at all. We consulted a gynecologist who suggested an ultrasound. The report reveals a small uterus 53.3 by 19.9 mm. We were then referred to an endocrinologist who ordered a series of tests. She has insulin resistance. Fasting insulin level is 77. Her LH is 2.6. Her FSH is 8.6. The prolactin level is 9.6. She has vitamin D deficiency. Her SGPT and SGOT levels are elevated to 92 and 96 respectively. He has prescribed Evion 400 twice daily for a month and Ovral G once in a day, for ten days and vitamin D once a week for eight weeks. I am very worried. Is the medicine correct? Will she get her periods again? Will she be able to get pregnant after she gets married? Please tell me.","Doctor":"Hello. Your sister could be having polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS). It is a metabolic problem which is quite common these days. This is not a disease per se related to the ovaries but, to the whole metabolism of the body. This usually manifests as irregular cycles, excess hair growth (male pattern), obesity, etc. and there is a future risk of developing diabetes and hypertension. I would advise your sister to consider regular exercises and weight reduction as her BMI (body mass index) is in the overweight range. The medications she has been prescribed are alright. Ladies with PCOS usually have difficulty in conception but, it is possible if they regulate their cycles and their body with regular exercise and diet modifications. Do not worry about future conception. She will definitely be able to concieve, provided she regularly follows up with the advice of her gynecologist. Assure her and all the best.

He is on ART medicine since the last 13 years. He has AIDS. He had seizures last year, so he is also taking Ecosprin 75 mg, Septran, and Eptoin daily. I have two questions.

For more information consult a general surgeon online -->"},{"Patient":"Hello doctor,I am trying to conceive but my husband and I did cocaine a week ago. How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases.

For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations.

As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves.

But there are other causes too. Some kind of foods, and internal bleeding are also responsible for that. You can check it very easily. Just stop Abhayaristam for two to three days and observe your stool. Also, give attention to your food. Spinach, beetroot, or other iron-rich foods also cause brown or blackish stool.

If you have taken I-pill within 72 hours of unprotected intercourse, then you are likely to remain safe. The success rate of the I-pill is 99.5% if taken within 24 hours. So, you should expect a withdrawal bleed within the next five to seven days and once the bleeding starts that shall indirectly confirm that you are not pregnant. You are required to be patient now and wait for your menstrual withdrawal. As you are already in the last week of your cycle, the chances of pregnancy are low and to add you have further covered it up with an I-pill. So, your chances of conception are negligible.

Also, in the last few weeks, the bone of neck pointed bone between both the shoulders also giving pain. Also, I have pain in both the knees and backside muscles, some itching or irritation type of pain happens throughout the day.

After cesarean section every woman experiences back pain for a few months, which is related to the surgery and spinal anesthesia. During surgery some of the nerves get cut while giving incision and this can give pain. The other reason for pain is uterine contractions. But, eventually this pain gets subsided over a period of a few months. One more cause for post cesarean pain is a deficiency of calcium in the body. Most of the calcium gets dissolved and secreted in breast milk and it causes weakness of bones and back pain. When this deficiency increases patient develops generalized body pain. I would suggest you to check your serum calcium and vitamin D level. Also, you can do a bone mineral density test to know the condition of your bones. You can take calcium and vitamin D supplements. For copper-T, consult your gynecologist and get it checked. As you have mentioned that the pain increases during periods, this pain is due to uterine contractions which is exaggerated during periods. I suggest tablet Meftal spas (Mefenamic acid) during periods, if you get severe pain. Consult your doctor, discuss with him or her and take the medicine with consent. Calcium deficiency.

From the available description it appears to be Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD) which is a kind of anxiety disorder that needs long term treatment. I would like to tell you that GAD is a kind of relapsing and remitting disorder and needs both medications as well as counselling. Before moving for counselling try the following methods of anxiety and fear management. I am noting down few of the strategies which are used to reduce stress and anxiety. I hope it will be very useful for you to reduce your symptoms. Diet - Ensure intake of adequate quantity of fibre. Two servings of vegetable salad and two servings of fruits (preferably with one citrus fruit). Proper diet does miracles and rejuvenates. Orange is a good source of antioxidants. Avoid junk food and fast food especially pizza, burgers and excessive sweets. Ensure adequate water intake - Follow \\"rule of 1\\" which I usually advise. 1 glass of water 1 hour before and 1 glass of water 1 hour after every meals will ensure adequate consumption of water. Recommended intake of water is 2 to 3 litres a day. Early morning exercise - Brisk walk for 30 minutes at a stretch preferably in garden will be very helpful. Avoid tea/coffee/nicotine and alcoholic beverages - If at all you want to drink something, drink fresh lime water. It is very much refreshing. Start your day with a glass of lemon water with 2 teaspoons of honey added to it. Have a good breakfast. Do not work stressfully - We all have the thought to excel in our respective fields and do not spend adequate time with our own self. So, try to understand your own needs and spend time for yourself and your family. When the work pressure is high, call it a day, take a short leave and hit out to some picnic spot which you always wanted to go. While working take frequent regular breaks - Taking regular breaks will not waste the time, but will definitely increase the productivity, concentration and reasoning. Meditation and yoga will help you a lot. Other than this, take the medications regularly. The medicines you are having take lots of time before they reach their maximum potential. In many cases it may take upto 12 weeks.Regarding sexual problems, they may be related to both anxiety or current medication.

After taking the medications, he needs to gargle well with warm saline and make sure he has had a very thorough mouth cleanse. I suggest tablet Emeset (Ondansetron) 8 mg twice daily for five days, and Pantoprazole 40 mg twice daily for five days. Consult a specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines with their consent. Since he might get dehydrated due to fluid loss from the body and also electrolyte loss, he needs to have lots of fluids and start ORS in sips.

My vitamin D levels are also deficient over 3 years. I have a BP of 140/80 and my heart rate ranges between 65 and 78.

The double vision cleared after 20 minutes of closing my eyes in the medical tent. After a week, I saw an ophthalmologist who did a few tests and concluded that it was eye fatigue. I experienced double vision in a triathlon just after the swimming portion (30 minutes into the race). What is the reason for having double vision and is it preventable? Is there any reason other than fatigue that causes double vision? It never happened in my regular day to day activities.","Doctor":"Hi. It seems that you have phoria (not strabismus) and the fatigue in eye muscle cause double vision. I advise you to decrease the effort.

The third test was done today morning and the result was 79,000. The clinical assistants said they are not able to ensure an increase in the platelet count. We are too tensed.

I was also taking vitamin E and A. The scabs were formed and came off maybe when sleeping on the pillow. The pink layer of skin is reflected under the scab. I had flawless skin before this. Will the marks leave a scar or only spots will be formed with these? I have attached closeup pictures. What should be applied to the skin spots? Can I apply any collagen boosting cream or Mederma?

Follihair is not helping me. Kindly suggest.","Doctor":"Hi. Chickenpox rash may take a course between 5 to 15 days (attachment removed to protect patient identity). It is advisable not to pick the scabs. You can continue with Lactocalamine. Once the scabs fall off, you could start using sunscreen lotion during the day and a skin lightening cream like Demelan (Glycolic acid and Kojic acid) to the spots. Depressed scars are common after chickenpox, mostly if the blisters were big and deep or if you try to pick with nails. Scars can be treated with chemical peels or lasers later on.

HbA1c is 11 and fasting blood sugar level is 247 with G.M.SR 2. Her ESR is 40. She is suffering from frequent body aches these days especially in shoulders. In the past, she has taken Glimestar. Please help.","Doctor":"Hello. A fasting blood sugar level of 247 is quite high and HbA1c (glycated hemoglobin) of 11 indicates uncontrolled blood sugar. The medication that your mother is taking is not sufficient to control her blood sugar. She definitely needs a revision of her prescription.  Uncontrolled blood sugar levels can lead to inflammatory conditions that show up as body pains. People with diabetes are also predisposed to developing frozen shoulder, which might explain her shoulder pain. She might need medication and physiotherapy for this. Her ESR (erythrocyte sedimentation rate) is also high and it needs further evaluation. She also seems to be underweight which is characteristic of uncontrolled diabetes. Her medication needs to be changed, but only after a complete physical examination and evaluation of laboratory parameters by a diabetes specialist. She can probably be relieved of most of her issues once her blood sugar is controlled. I suggest you visit a diabetes specialist at the earliest to avoid any complications.

I feel like freaking out, and my mind does not work. Whenever I sleep for too long or if I have lack of sleep these symptoms tend to increase. I have insomnia also. I am comfortable staying awake the entire night and sleep during the daytime. I am losing my social life because of these problems. The only thing I can do is just study for a while and prepare my food. That is it. Please suggest medications for these symptoms.","Doctor":"Hello. You are having multiple problems. So, along with the medicines, you need to do regular exercise and maintain a good sleep hygiene. Also, try identifying the triggers for your headaches and try avoiding them. Secondly, in such situations, SSRIs (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors) such as Fluoxetine or Paroxetine can be helpful. Psychotherapy is also recommended. For migraine prophylaxis, I suggest Propranolol as it helps to lower the anxiety. Initially, for a few days, I suggest you try Benzodiazepine such as Clonazepam first to take care of your anxiety and insomnia and then the SSRIs. I suggest pain-relieving medication such as Naproxen to be used on an as-needed basis. These are prescription drugs. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him/her and take the above medications with their consent. Thanks and regards.

How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations.

As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves.

It does not hurt or itch. It is only on my left breast and on my right breast there is only like five small spots. I am very scared what it might be.","Doctor":"Hello. There is a possibility of pityriasis versicolor. Pityriasis versicolor is a superficial fungal infection caused by Malassezia furfur. The infection is more common in hot and humid weather conditions, which favor the growth of the fungus. Clinically, it presents as light brown colored patches with fine, brawny scaling and resolves with post-inflammatory hypopigmentation. A single oral dose of an oral antifungal like Fluconazole 400 mg is curative. Itraconazole 200 mg once daily for a week is an alternative. Also, apply 2 % Ketoconazole lotion over the whole affected area while showering, lather it well and leave it on for five minutes daily for five days. Post-inflammatory hypopigmentation takes some time to respond. Repigmentation can be hastened by daily sun exposure for five to 10 minutes. Repeated recurrences are common and the patches may seem to persist forever, with new patches appearing while older one resolve.

How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases.

For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations.

As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves.

I did an ultrasound and an ultrasound with doppler 6 months ago and they were normal. However, today when I went to a specialist in osteopathy for leg pain, he by chance pressed on my liver area and told me that I have a rigid liver. Do I have cirrhosis?","Doctor":"Hi. I have read through your query and attachments in detail. (attachments removed to protect patient identity) Please find my observations below. Having gone through your reports in detail, cirrhosis is unlikely as your most recent ultrasound done on 1st December 2014 shows normal liver and doppler. Your liver function tests are also in normal range in the last one year. Cirrhosis is an advanced condition in which the liver undergoes irreversible fibrosis and this occurs over a time period. Your results do not indicate cirrhosis in any way. Kidney function is assessed by doing serum creatinine and blood urea levels. I suppose your kidneys were also visualized in December 2014 ultrasound and were found to be normal. To know more accurately about the kidneys I recommended doing serum creatinine test and blood urea. However it is most likely that your kidneys should be working normally. The kidneys are located deep inside and cannot be felt from the front side of abdomen, therefore it is not possible that your kidneys were felt. It is possible that when he by chance pressed the liver area, your muscles in the anterior abdomen were contracted and mistaken for stiffness. With normal liver function tests and recent ultrasound scan being normal it is extremely rare for you to have cirrhosis. There is a way to measure the stiffness of liver by ultrasound and it is called liver stiffness measurement by transient elastography. Medical literature says that liver stiffness measurement has proved to be an useful and specific procedure to screen for cirrhosis in the general population and to detect undiagnosed chronic liver disease in apparently healthy subjects. The above ultrasound technique is a special ultrasound method and you can get it done to for a more accurate evaluation of liver stiffness and clear your doubt.

I am also getting the CT to look at the vessels more closely. There are no associated symptoms. Also, this happened almost two years before.","Doctor":"Hi. Cardiac origin of chest pain is highly unlikely in a 29 year old female. Female has a cardioprotective hormone called estrogen, which usually delays the onset of coronary artery disease till 65 years. The pain you get is most likely because of high levels of your anxiety or overthinking. Once shunt reversal in PFO (patent foramen ovale) is ruled out, then you can ask your cardiologist to start you with a low dose of SSRI (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor) like Paroxetine along with low doses of anti-anxiety medicine benzodiazepine like Clonazepam for two to three months.

I have read your query and understand your concern. Social anxiety disorder is really a disturbing condition, but can be controlled with proper medicines and behavior therapy. Anxiety disorders occur in episodes and sometimes follow waxing and waning course. You had anxiety before 25 years of age and the anxiety relapsed since last one year. The feelings that people are judging you, ideas that what others will think or say, self-consciousness are typical symptoms of social anxiety. Feelings that you are good for nothing and unproductive are due to co-morbid depressive symptoms of social anxiety. Do you have anxiety during a presentation or in group discussions? Do you feel shy or stutter while talking to some person of big stature or any problems in talking to females? In severe social anxiety such type of anxiety situations is also seen. Medicines especially selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are drugs of choice for social anxiety. I suggest you to use Escitalopram drug. The drug is started with 5 mg dose for about 10 days and then can be increased to 10 mg. The drug should be taken in the morning after meals and should be used for about three to four months. After four to six weeks the dose can be reduced gradually. I suggest you to use Propranolol for anxiety provoking situations. The drug can be taken about half to one hour before some situations like presentations or group discussions. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and take the medicine with their consent. These medicines will definitely help in improvement. Breathing exercise and relaxation exercises will help you to control anxiety. Apart from this relaxation exercise, behavior therapy also helps in reducing the symptoms.

Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

Again this month, when I checked, the level remains the same. I would like to know whether it is normal. If it is abnormal what should I follow to bring back that to normal?","Doctor":"Hi. Based on your query, my opinion is as follows: Hemoglobin level of 17.1 is near normal. Increased hemoglobin can be seen in conditions, where oxygenation is less, like hilly areas, lung disorders and the air you breathe is low in oxygen. To compensate red blood cells increases and hence the hemoglobin. In these conditions, hemoglobin can be more than 18 g% and we call this condition as polycythemia. At present, for you it is not polycythemia. Unless it is more than 18 g%, there is nothing to worry. No need to return it to normal. Few books do say that the range between 13.5 and 17.5 is normal in male. At present, there is nothing to worry. Blood donation is good and do continue it.

What type of crown is recommended for an endodontically treated upper molar (tooth #26), solid zirconia or eMax? I am worried about the abrasive effects Zirconia might have on the opposing dentition. Will a zirconia crown cause secondary caries under the crown as a result of abrasion against opposing teeth? I also understand it may be difficult to detect decay or treat decay under zirconia crowns, is that so? If so, would eMax or any other all-ceramic crown be a better choice for my endodontically treated molar? I am not a grinder or clencher, and this would be my first crown. I would greatly appreciate all insights and recommendations.","Doctor":"Hi. Zirconium crown will be a better choice because you are young. If the tooth is properly adjusted, that is, if the crown placement is done properly, there will not be abrasive effects.

Please help.","Doctor":"Hi, Welcome to iciniq.com. The reason for a chronic ear infection can be due to two reasons. 1. There is an abnormal permanent defect in your eardrum (such a hole which has not closed up due to the normal healing process) leading to recurrent ear infection and discharge. In some cases, superadded fungal infection might also be present causing itching and pain. 2. A dysfunction in your eustachian tubes which basically equalize pressure between your nose and your ear. In both scenarios, you will feel blocked ears, ringing sensations, heaviness, and decreased hearing would certainly be there. Follow these steps: 1. You have to maintain adequate ear hygiene not allowing any foreign substances such as outside air or water to enter into the ear and thereby creating a recurrent infection. 2. Do not use q tips as they worsen the existing problem by introducing more disease since the q tips are often not sterilized. 3. Get your self examined by an ent specialist to see what exactly is happening in your ear and the probable cause of the problem. I hope this helps."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor,I am trying to conceive but my husband and I did cocaine a week ago. How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method.

For the last seven years, I was suffering from sudden sleep disturbance with following symptoms:  Breathlessness. Palpitation. Chest congestion.  I underwent the following tests: ECG, chest X-ray, echocardiography, exercise stress test, pulmonary function test, VIDAS PL, MRI scan of brain and sleep apnea test. All the above tests were normal. At last, I was diagnosed as having acid reflux symptoms and accordingly on doctor's advise I took proton pump inhibitors for about four months (Topacid 40 mg, Nexapro 40 mg, and Perinorm CD). The medication is discontinued and with the change of lifestyle (like light dinner, breathing exercise, etc.) I was able to control the symptoms effectively. But, occasionally I was experiencing irregular heart rhythms and on a medical Specialist's advise I took Prolol TR 40 mg for two months and after a satisfactory result, the specialist advised me to discontinue the medicine. Now, the present episodes (as described below) compelled me to seek opinion and advice. Occasionally, I am feeling dizziness, breathing difficulty on a lighter side, blurriness on the eyes, chest congestion, etc.These symptoms are quite evident when I bent my head while doing exercise (not always). Last week, while doing a breathing exercise on a sitting posture and when suddenly changed the posture by getting up, I almost fainted, but recovered instantaneously. But afterward, I felt weakness in the legs and arms, cold, breathlessness, etc. I play badminton for one to two hours daily without any problem. My B-12 and hemoglobin levels are satisfactory and BP is normal in the range 85 to 130 Hg for the last five years without medication. There is no history of diabetes or cholesterol.","Doctor":"Hello. I have gone through your details and I have the following inputs: First of all, you have gone through a lot of tests which were not needed in your case, but since everything is normal, that is reassuring. Your symptoms can be related to a few problems as I understand. The first one is, of course, GERD (gastroesophageal reflux disease) for which you have taken treatment. The problem with your treatment was - Perinorm is a medicine which is not used these days due to its side effects called as extrapyramidal symptoms. It causes dizziness and imbalance in some people. So, your present symptoms might be an after effect of that medicine. You should continue PPI (proton pump inhibitors) because once you have GERD, it would never get normal and the medicine should be continued for very long. You have mentioned that you have irregular heartbeats. This is a serious and complicated issue if this really is seen. You might be \\"feeling\\" this but if we can see this in our tests then this should be immediately treated. How to catch this? A normal ECG will not tell irregularities if it is sub-clinical or if it is occasional like in your case. We have to study the ECG (electrocardiogram) patterns of one full day continuously to find this out. So, go for a test called as Holter study to find if you have dysrhythmias of any kind and once treated, your symptoms will vanish. You have mentioned that you feel dizzy and faint when you stand up and then recover. This is a typical symptom of orthostatic hypotension which means, your BP falls as soon as you stand up and then the heart recovers it in seconds. This is a common problem and we need to find the cause for this. It can be age-related or organ related, or it can be due to a blockage in carotid arteries, etc. It is difficult to pinpoint the cause till we examine you and then the tests are done according to what we find. I would suggest that you take a print of these points to a cardiologist in your area and tell him to look for all this. You will surely hit the correct diagnosis and get treated easily. None of the above problems are tough to treat. Hope that was helpful.

As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses.

He is verbal now and has improved a lot with the help of therapies. How close is a hiatal hernia associated with autism? We have a history of hiatal hernias in my family. I also read that hiatal hernia can irritate or damage vagus nerve, which may result in autistic symptoms. My son gets frequent hiccups and has a slight swelling in his upper abdomen. Kindly confirm if there is really a link between autism, vagus nerve, and hiatal hernia. Is there any treatment in ayurveda or siddha for this? Thanks in advance for the replies and your valuable time.","Doctor":"Hi. Thanks for this query. I can understand your concern regarding your son's autism. First of all, I would like to tell you, there is a relation between autism and gastrointestinal symptoms like burping, constipation, and loose bowel movements. A hiatal hernia has a genetic preponderance, but no association with autism. Your son will improve with age. Can you tell me about his ultrasound report? Because grading is related with prognosis and chances of vagus nerve injury. Abdominal swelling may be because of bloating and slight hernia. A high-fiber diet and breathing exercises will help in early recovery from a hiatal hernia. Yoga and light exercises will help to strengthen the diaphragm. Hope my answer helped you. Regards.

No, it is not so, as you have an infection in the outer part of the ear. It is called as otitis externa. In this condition, there will be a severe aching pain in the outer ear. The cause of otitis externa may be due to a humid environment, any micro-injuries, or any fungal infections. In this situation, you need to take care. Continue the drops for at least two weeks so that the infection clears speedily. Now you are on Ciprofloxacin ear drops which is a broad-spectrum antibiotic. It is useful in most of the situations, but if you are having a fungal infection, it will not help you.

Pus in the color of chocolate and little thick is coming out. Is it normal? How much time it will take to recover? For how many days the drain has to be installed?","Doctor":"Hello. I had gone through all the data you have posted. We need to know some more details about your problem. Liver abscess is mainly of two types: Bacterial and amebic. From your description as chocolate like pus, it goes more in favor of amebic etiology. So, we need to keep you on tissue agents like Metronidazole, luminal agents like Diloxanide furoate and Paromomycin for elimination of ameba from the intestine. If pus culture grows bacteria or if abscesses are multiple, then we need to provide specific coverage against the organism. Depending upon the amount of pus inside, it is normal for draining of pus like that. Time to recovery depends upon the cause of amebic versus bacterial, size of the abscess and white blood cell count. Drain needs to be continued until full drainage of the collection is done. Repeat ultrasound scan has to be performed to look for residual collection. Manipulation of the position of the drain may be needed for drainage of residual collection. Once the collection becomes dry, then the drain can be removed.

After my yearly appointment last year, I had excessive bleeding and irritation of my cervix upon examination. I was told I had chronic cervicitis and an overgrowth of tissue on my cervix which would need to be removed by surgery. Since then, I have not been the same. My period is not regular and sex not as enjoyable as it used to be. Is this normal?","Doctor":"Hello. Nuvaring is a hormone-releasing contraceptive ring placed in the vagina. As it is hormone based, it causes side effects like menstrual irregularities, decrease in libido, vaginal itching, infection, headache, bloating, weight and appetite changes, abnormal hair growth, skin darkening, bloating, changes in appetite and weight, etc. So, all the symptoms you described are side effects of your long-term use of the same method of hormonal contraceptive. My advice would be to try to avoid using the same mode and same hormonal contraceptive for years. Try to have one that suits your body and would have the least side effects. For cervical growth, undergo colposcopy. Repeat Pap smear if it has been more than three years.

How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases.

I read your query and understand the concern expressed by you. In regard to the current medication, I would like to inform you that Parocen CR is one option for premature ejaculation but does not have any effect on weak erection. It can be said that in last three years a new molecule is approved for the treatment of premature ejaculation which is equally effective and do not have common side effects encountered with Parocen CR or other drugs which were in use three years back. I am not sure why your doctor prescribed you Nano leo as it has minimal effect on erection. It is used for increasing testosterone level which has more effect on desire rather than erection. As you informed that you do not have any problem with desire, the possibility of using Nano leo is ruled out. Regarding the viagra, it has definite effect on erection and there is no doubt that it can be effective in your case. Having said this I would like to know what was your initial problem, premature ejaculation or weak erection? I commonly observed that people with erection problem try to rush the sexual intercourse because of fear that they will not able to maintain the erection for sufficient time. This kind of rushing develops artificial premature ejaculation. I need to inform you that if you developed your premature ejaculation in response to erection problem then there is need to treat only erection problem. As the cause suggests, with treatment of erection problem the premature ejaculation will be treated automatically. In case you feel that both the problems are independent then there is need to address both issues simultaneously for correction of the problem. Before we move to treatment part of the problem we need to identify the possible cause of the problem.

Today some bright red blood has come out. But the baby is moving. Often I have abdominal pain (mild to severe). I have a prior history of miscarriage. I am much worried and tensed. My doctor prescribed Tidilan retard 40, calcium and iron tablet. I am on bed rest too. Please help.","Doctor":"Hello. Considering your history and bleeding on and off from the 16th week, and now at 24th week of gestation, you are presented with an old and mild retroplacental hemorrhage over the anteriorly placed placenta grade 1 maturity. (as per attached reports). One needs to understand that retroplacental clot means that there is a part of placenta which got detached from uterus and got filled with blood at the 16th week. Luckily the bleeding did not continue and got stopped and hence the size did not increase, thereby causing complete separation and fetal loss called abruptio placentae (placental abruption). Now what happens is, as the fetus grows, the uterine wall is stretched and the placental attachment tends to get stretched as well and definitely there would be some bleeding occurring, as it has been in your case. Initially the bleed was concealed, then now it has started to reveal. The main fear is abruptio placentae which is an emergency where due to bleeding, the whole placenta separates from uterus and there is heavy bleeding. It is accompanied with severe pain and uterus is board like hard in consistency. It is dangerous for the fetus and causes death in minutes. Hence you have been given Tidilan retard 40 which is a uterine relaxant and would prevent any form of undue contraction or stretch to affect the already hemorrhaged site. However, the present aim would be to carry the pregnancy till 34 weeks till the lungs of the baby matures and you have to be on complete bed rest and if possible in the hospital only. The reason is, what you have been experiencing has been the warning bleed. It may so happen that suddenly you may have an accidental antepartum severe hemorrhage where immediate attention or probably cesarean may be required to save the child, hence hospital stay where you would be better observed is preferable till delivery. In our practice, this is a high risk pregnancy and abruptio placentae is one of the dreaded diagnosis which often leaves very less time for the doctor and the fetus, hence complete rest, uterine relaxation and hospital stay is warranted. I do not intend to scare you, but it is indeed necessary to be vigilant and careful for a safe future.

First of all, there is no need to worry and relieve your anxiety. In all probabilities, you are having obstructive sleep apnea as all your data fits into it. Do you have any symptoms like snoring, interrupted sleep, unrefreshing sleep, morning headaches, daytime sleepiness, etc.? If yes, then it further supports the diagnosis. Obstructive sleep apnea is a condition characterised by obstruction of upper airway especially during sleep due to lax airway and narrowing of airway due to obesity. Obstruction of upper airway leads to temporary stoppage of respiration, increased sympathetic drive and increased pulse rate. Also, another reason for pulse rate rise is deconditioning as you are not accustomed to activities. The investigation I suggest includes ENT examination if you have any symptoms of nasal stuffiness, recurrent tonsillitis to rule nasal causes of obstruction, thyroid function test, lipid profile, sugar, HbA1c and vitamin D. I also suggest polysomnography, which is sleep study to confirm the diagnosis and extent of disease and pressure of CPAP (continuous positive airway pressure) needed.

His past history included pneumonia several years ago, leg cramps once in every two weeks or so and vitamin B helps with it and minor daily coughing of unsure cause. He never smoked and does not drink alcohol. Three and a half weeks ago, he went to the ER due to severe chest pain. His EKG was apparently unconcerned, chest x-ray was clear, CT scan of the chest was normal and all the laboratory tests were normal. He was given Morphine and Nitro and the chest pain got resolved. He was sent home the same night with Nitro prescription and an appointment to see a cardiologist. He saw cardiologist one and a half weeks ago. His cardiologist said that his EKG reveals AFib and not happy with a CT scan of the chest due to poor timing of filming versus contrast injection. He placed him on Diltiazem, Eliquis and Nitro prn. Also, he placed him on a cardiac monitor at home and given a follow up in two weeks.After the cardiologist appointment, my dad started getting a horrible dry, hacking cough, which gets worse every day. He is unable to sleep. He can only sleep on the chair here and there. Strangely, when he lies down, the cough subsides. It resumes immediately on sitting up and walking around. I finally convinced him to call the cardiologist about severe unrelenting cough since being put on new medicines. Then, we met the cardiologist and had a heart monitor read. As the cough still persists, chest x-ray was ordered and no pneumonia, but fluid was found around his heart. So, the cardiologist has placed him additionally on Digoxin, Lasix and Potassium along with Cardizem, Eliquis and Nitro prn. He is asked to wear monitor longer and given next appointment after three weeks.Now, he is on the third day of medication and no change was observed in cough or inability to sleep.

It is good to hear that you are concerned and participating in treating your father's health issues. From your description, it looks like he has congestive heart failure. It means the fluid around his heart is causing the Atrial fibrillation and the cough. This is typical when lying down, since the position of the heart changes then.

Furosemide is the only medicine that will help the water to clear out, it also might cause a bit of the cough, which was the reason for changing of the medicines by the cardiologist initially, due to the side effects of cough. I understand your concern, but according to me, the treatment is fine, except maybe he might now need a higher dose of Lasix or admission to get the Lasix IV administration.

How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

I have thoroughly gone through your case and can well understand your genuine health concerns. 1. No, there is not much problem right now as he vomited and also had a lot of water. It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases.

For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations. If the size and number of cysts are more, then I suggest consulting a gynecologist as you may require surgery.

As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves.

But, I did not get period for the last three months. I had it removed before 20 days and no period still. While on it, I would throw up and even after having it removed, I puked. Since being removed, my nipples have been super hard and sore all the time. I just feel off. Could I be pregnant? Or is it just the left over birth control? Before three months, I had a pregnancy test while on birth control and it was negative. The period I had while on it was light pink, then brown and then red. It only showed when I wiped.","Doctor":"Hi. Nexplanon is a progesterone having implant (Etonogestrel). After insertion, the menses can be irregular or even stopped for 6 months to almost 1 year. But, if you had not gotten your period since last three months and you had regular intercourse, then you should do a urine pregnancy test first. If it is negative, then it is delayed menses due to Nexplanon. Periods become irregular because your normal hormonal cycle of your body gets disturbed due to Nexplanon (outside hormones) like drugs. And, your body takes time for recovering from this disturbance to a normal cycle. It takes time according to your body type, levels of hormone secretion in your body, tissue responses of your body and many other things. Some are known and some are not. Nipple hardness is also due to this disturbance. Because, breast tissue and your uterus are the two major organs, which gets maximum effect due to hormones according to their levels. Other than this, the total body has effects of hormones, but not every single are appreciated or being experienced. Mood swing is also related to one of these. The bleeding for three months after Nexplanon may be because it does either more or less than what is required for your body. In both cases, you may have bleeding. But, it is more likely due to very low doses. You can take oral contraceptive pills for 1 or 2 months and then stop it to see whether periods get started regularly or not. Also, drink more water.

You are right. You should not have used a topical retinoids-based cream for such a long period as you are aware it makes the skin photosensitive. It will take time for the skin to heal. Along with the broad-spectrum sunscreen which you are using, consider applying a moisturizer such as Epitheliale AH cream. It will help hydrate the skin. Also, it will not cause acne. Stop all other applications and scrubs. Use Cetaphil cleansing lotion to wash the face. There is a procedure called as Oxypeel where a jet of water is sprayed on the face followed by a mask. It helps hydrate the skin. You can consider visiting a dermatologist for the same. Clinical photographs would have helped to know the present situation better.

The person I had the encounter with has since had two kids. So, I am pretty sure I have nothing to worry about. But, I just wanted to be sure.","Doctor":"Hi. Testing can only prove your surety of having nothing in the context to Sexually transmitted disease (STD). If you had unprotected exposure 10 years back and no further exposure during subsequent years and you are asymptomatic also, it is unlikely that you will have STD. However, since asymptomatic STDs are also known, I usually recommend my sexually active patients get tested for HIV (human immunodeficiency virus), HCV (Hepatitis C virus), HBV (Hepatitis B virus), chlamydia, syphilis, and gonorrhea. There is no harm to know the baseline status of these. Hope your query is answered, but if you have any other query, please do not hesitate to ask or call anytime.

How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

From going through the information you have provided, it is clear that currently you are on treatment for suspected GERD - gastroesophageal reflux disease (acid reflux disease). You have been having intermittent problems over five years. Acid reflux can cause breathlessness and waking up from sleep at night. Some might feel and describe heartburns, but others may not actually feel the burning sensation. The symptoms can be worsened by stress, anxiety and panic attacks. My recommendations are an endoscopy procedure called gastroscopy will help to check for any weakness in the valve at the lower end of the food pipe (gullet or esophagus) and to directly visualize any evidence of inflammation there that is reflux esophagitis. Following the above test, you may require a 24 hour pH monitoring study and a manometry test to confirm that acid is refluxing back whenever you have symptoms and that there is no problem with motility of the gullet. I agree with you that I would not continue on Perinorm CD (Metoclopramide). I tend to give it only for nausea or vomiting. Some people with GERD may find that eliminating certain food helps to improve their symptoms. For example avoiding spicy foods, raw onion, garlic, black pepper, citrus products and juices of orange, grapefruit or cranberry, tomato products, chocolate or brownies, caffeine, sodas, coffee, tea, etc., peppermint, fatty or greasy foods. 1. Gastroscopy. 2. 24 hour esophageal pH monitoring and esophageal manometry. 1. GERD. 2. Functional dyspepsia.

In this case, the pacemaker avoids his bradycardia episodes only. For his tachycardia episodes, drugs can be given. Sometimes the drug controls it perfectly and sometimes it does not. You have to adjust the drug doses to control his tachycardia episodes. Consult your doctor for dose adjustment. In addition to the Prolomet (Metoprolol), I suggest Digoxin can also be added.

Approximately 10-11 years ago, I worked on a building site. I was asked to remove some insulation off a water pipe in an attic. At that time, I asked the site manager if the insulation was asbestos and he said it was not. I also took a sample of it back to the office and asked the health and safety manager and he also said it was not. As time has gone on I have always wondered if it was asbestos that I removed from the pipe. This was not a task I carried out frequently in my work so cannot think of any other times I may have come into contact with the asbestos. I worked as a plumber for approximately 2 years but I did not really get involved with older buildings. My main problem is that I am a hypochondriac and I recently saw a show on television where it said if you think you may have come across asbestos, speak to your general practitioner. So, I went to my GP and he advised that it would be considered a low risk encounter and people who suffer from mesothelioma are people who work with it day in and day out over many years. He said there was not any concern and that asbestos is in the air in small doses. I said I did not want to end up with mesothelioma and he advised that it was very rare and in his 30 years as a GP only one patient he knew had mesothelioma who worked in a ship building industry day in and day out. He said that even in a worst case situation it would not show up until I was in my 70s (I am just 30 years old now). The average latency period is around 40 years for mesothelioma. My visit did put my mind at rest but I still went for a second opinion and the private doctor advised me the same. As I had paid for a 25 minutes consultation she did give me a physical examination and said everything was normal. After checking my peak flow test in which I scored 660 and my blood oxygen saturation which was 98%, she said it was really good. She said everything was normal and not to worry.

You are 30 years old and there is no latent period for mesothelioma to come up like this. A person at very high continuous exposure of asbestos, may develop asbestosis after more than 20 years. Every asbestosis patient never gets malignant mesothelioma or lung carcinoma (it is same as not every hepatitis B patient gets hepatocellular carcinoma). Mesothelioma never comes as a first sign of disease. It first appears as many lung issues that go on for many years and with chronic asbestosis it may sometimes affect the patient. You are all safe and negative for any kind of lung issues. In my view, you are never a candidate of asbestosis or mesothelioma as the pipe insulations you had removed has been confirmed having no asbestos by your safety manager. Right now your lungs are all very fine and you did really great with the peak flow testing. Your blood oxygen saturation is very good being 98%.You were at a risk of less than 1% of developing asbestosis. If you were working in an industry like ship making or painting and you inhaled years and years of large amounts of asbestos on a continuous basis, you may develop asbestosis. Same is the case with other pneumoconiosis (occupational lung diseases) categories.If there had been any risks or damages done to the delicate parts of your lungs, you would have most probably been presented as:"},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I am suffering from gout - podagra for the past 16 years.

It starts out with two to three days of somewhat heavy period then the rest of it is light spotting with no pain throughout the entire period. Maybe the first day might have minimal pain, but that rarely happens. I have never had irregular period or any odd menstruation issues. Three months back I got night sweat or chills for the first two nights of my period and it went away. Last month, during my periods again I had night sweats and chills for the first two nights. Before three months, I felt like my PMS body heat was increasingly hot. Three months ago my period was two days late and last month it was two days early. About myself: I am a single 27 year old, goes to the gym two to three times per week. I eat relatively healthy with minimal sugar intake and no soda or fast food. I get 6-7 hours of sleep per night. The only issue I have is mild lactose intolerance and acne where I have been using topical acne treatment (Aczone and Onexton gel). I used to take sleep aids over-the-counter for nights where I went to gym late. I normally have warm temperature. I was wondering if there is any concern for my night sweats and chills at night for the first two nights of my period for the past three months and increased PMS body heat. Please help.","Doctor":"Hello. Chills and night sweats are actually unusual symptoms of PMS (premenstrual syndrome). They have been seen in some women who experience a sudden Progesterone withdrawal as compared to a gradual one, leading to heavier first two days of menses possibly with clots. Some element is contributed by the heaviness of blood flow as well due to sudden decrease in blood volume which gets controlled over next few days. So, the best treatment shall be to keep yourself well hydrated during these days.

But, his sugar levels and BP are very much in control. He is taking oral medication for both diabetes and BP. He is taking Telvas 20 mg for BP, Gluconorm for diabetes and taking thyroid medication for hypothyroidism (25 mg). He has been diagnosed with initial stage squamous cell carcinoma of the tongue. We first noticed symptoms around two months back, because of a blister on my father's tongue which did not heal despite of vitamin B complex medication and antibiotics. The medical oncologist we were referred to examined my father and said that it is in the very initial stage and it is highly unlikely to spread. Even if it has, at the maximum it would be in the lymph nodes near the tongue. We opted for a PET CT scan to be sure and the doctor prescribed only a head and neck scan. The scan results mentioned an SUV level of 5.3, suggesting malignancy on the tongue and an SUV level of 3.1 in level I, II and III lymph nodes, which the radiologist mentioned were non-specific. I would like to add that my father had a minor cold when the scan was done. Based on the scan results our doctor has suggested surgery to remove the cancerous portion of the tongue and the lymph nodes, though it is not clear whether they are affected or not. He also mentioned that after removal again the lymph nodes would be tested for malignancy. He underwent PET CT scan, serum creatinine, CBC and blood tests. My question is should we have to go for a full body scan instead of just the head and neck? With respect to the lymph nodes, is the SUV number suggestive of cancer? Or could it be higher because of the cold my father had? Thank you very much for your response in advance.","Doctor":"Hello.

I am a 44-year-old working mother of three children and normally in great health. In the last 20 years, I have had about three visual migraines. There is no headache and I get back to normal 30 minutes later. This week, I had a visual migraine on Monday, felt a bit nauseous afterward for the rest of the day. I woke up on Tuesday and felt normal. Then about 8.30 AM started with another visual migraine. Then, I had a terrible headache and vomited. The right cheek and right arm went numb that lasted all day. I had another one on Wednesday and a fourth on Thursday. The thing that is worrying me is that I am still not back to normal. I could not remember people’s names at work on Friday and felt totally spaced out and at times confused. I did not remember speaking to my mother on the phone this morning. In fact, I rang her and when she answered through the car speaker I had forgotten it was me that rang her. I saw my GP on Friday and she said no red flag symptoms but she has referred me to a neurologist as I have had multiple migraines and this is unusual. My appointment is on the 20th.

Your symptoms could be related to status migrainosus, which causes a temporary dysfunction of some brain regions related to persistent migraine attacks. For this reason I would recommend performing a brain MRI (which would be better compared to the CT scan) and some blood laboratory tests to investigate for possible causes which have triggered these frequent migraine attacks as follows: If a brain MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) cannot be performed in a short period of time, a brain CT (computed tomography) scan would be an option in case of persistent migraine attacks.

Never long-term, but I tried penis water pump and penis extenders. A few times that I used the penis extenders, the ring may have been very tightly packed around my penis while I was using it and due to the stretch it caused, and tightness, I lost circulation to my penis tip to a point the tip went numb and cold. After that, I started noticing my erections are much weaker and sensitivity has gone down significantly. Besides that, I also became very self-conscious and psychologically worried that I may have made my ED worse. I did not have problems getting an erection, but maintaining one was more difficult and my erections were softer. I stopped having sex. After three to four years, when I masturbate, the quality of the erection is much better and I am able to keep the erection but the sensitivity is not quite back. Also, my climaxes are much weaker and they do not feel as good. In the last year that I have masturbated, I have not had issues maintaining an erection when I am masturbating but I believe the sensitivity is not back. I am worried having sex, I will begin to lose the erection fast. I have red skin marks under the skin at my penis tip that is not going away. Is this due to dead cells? Have I done irreversible damage? Is there any treatment as I now am hoping to become sexually active? Many of my problems are from using the extenders and penis pump aggressively even though it was short usage and regretful decisions.","Doctor":"Hello. I saw the pictures (attachment removed to protect patient identity). The penis looks almost normal. As you are able to masturbate, post-marriage, sexual activity will not be an issue (rather it is better). Aggressive stretching may have caused some damage but from your description, it appears it will not affect your married life. Feeling an orgasm is also dynamic. It may become better after marriage and is unrelated to stretching. Do not worry. If after marriage there is any issue, you can consult again at that time.

It is impacting my sexual stamina and size.","Doctor":"Hi. Definitely, I would like to help you. It is good to hear that you are planning for marriage. Erection and hardness of penis mostly depend on your psychology. According to your thoughts, some hormonal activities occurs which leads to increase blood flow in penile blood cavity which causes hardness and erection. Stress, performance anxiety, injuries or other medical conditions may affect these functions. But do not worry it can be managed through ayurvedic medicines. The sebaceous cyst may not be harmful to you. But if it is irritating you then it needs surgical removal. Once you should check your blood sugar levels, lipid profile and testosterone levels. Take the following medicines to improve your concern: Rx, 1.Shatavaryadi Churna 3 gm twice a day with warm milk after meals. 2.Shilapravang 1 tablet twice a day with warm milk after meals. 3.Laghu Mushali paka 3 gm twice a day before food.

How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations. If the size and number of cysts are more, then I suggest consulting a gynecologist as you may require surgery.

As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves.

During the test, I cannot read the fourth line of letters even with the lenses they provide. All the lenses I have tried. Is it serious? What is the problem? I am very tensed.","Doctor":"Hello. In order to answer you, I need little more details. If you noticed this all of a sudden, then I have to think of something like keratitis or severe dry eyes. But If you do not have any other problems like gritty eyes, red eye with blurred vision, an inflammation (like keratitis), is unlikely which is a kind of a swelling in your cornea. If you are a frequent computer user and mostly live in air-conditioned rooms, dry eye can be an issue. Then you feel a discomfort in your eyes as if you got sand in your eyes. If so, there is no harm in using a tear supplement like refresh tears. It will make you at ease. Next, if you have been using glasses before or you should have been using but you ignored it then there is a problem. There is a condition called amblyopia where if your eyes have a problem since childhood that is ignored the brain starts forgetting your eyes. If you start full correct glasses at a very young age hopefully before 10, then there is a chance of reversing but after 17 years it will not correct and it is not possible to do anything. At your age, we have to consider keratoconus where your cornea is getting weaker, making it protrude like a cone. Usually, there it is present as a frequent need to change spectacles. There we need to see a map in your cornea with its thickness which is called a topography. And further, we need to see the back of your eyes to see your retina and optic nerve. I suggest you consult an eye doctor not a family doctor to sort this out for you.

Starting last month quite suddenly, I started having insomnia issues. The symptoms were difficulty to fall asleep, sensations of adrenaline, waking up scared when falling asleep, a sensation of weakness or numbness in both arms, mental agitation, restless legs syndrome, falling asleep late, waking up several times per night, unable to get back to sleep and having very vivid dreams. I just felt very weird altogether. I had this pretty bad for about a week last month then starting feeling a bit better with just one to two wakes during the night usually around 4 to 5 a.m. At the end of last month, I started taking melatonin supplements before going to bed, around 1.5 mg before going to bed and it made me sleep very well. I fell asleep within 40 minutes of taking it and then sleeping well throughout the night. Yesterday, I stopped the melatonin since I did not think I was supposed to take it for a long time and I had a horrible night. I woke up six to seven times, staying awake between 10 to 40 minutes each time, dreaming very vividly, being aware that I am dreaming while asleep, did not feel like I managed any deep sleep at all. I do not know what exactly is the matter with me. I am now fearing sporadic fatal insomnia and that is not helping things at all. I feel very distressed now.A bit about my context. I am a mother of a 1-year-old who sleeps in the same room with me, but he sleeps well throughout the night. I do check him whenever I wake up from sleep. I have done that since he was born but only had insomnia in the last one to two months. I am a bit stressed with all the work involving staying at home with the small child but nothing extreme. Last summer, I started having migraine with an aura all of a sudden during the stresses of starting solids and having to employ my non-existing cooking skills. I had an MRI and an angiogram and it was clear. I was diagnosed with migraines with aura and had a few of them for a few months and then they seemed to have stopped two months later. In the last three to four months, I also started having occasional hypnagogic and hypnopompic hallucinations with visual patterns appearing, pulsating with my own pulse and.or rotating my vision. I can only see them when there is dark and they disappear in about 5 to 20 minutes.I also have autoimmune hyperthyroidism, which only occasionally acts up. I have had this for 13 years. I only take medications when my thyroid acts up. I never had insomnia with this condition and I do not feel like being hyperthyroid at the moment with normal pulse, not a lot of anxiety, no panic attacks, not losing weight but I will check it tomorrow just in case. However, even if I am hyper, I would still not be sure the insomnia is related to that since I never had insomnia as a result of my thyroid condition. I have no one in my family with fatal insomnia, but my mother did have insomnia as a result of her anxiety and depression. This started when she was over 40. I do not have depression and have only mild anxiety related mainly to this new onset insomnia.  First of all, can this be sporadic fatal insomnia because this scares me a lot during the night?   Also, can this be some sort of psychosis or whatever? Something neurological?   During the day, I feel and function normally. Today I do feel especially shaken up and feel unusual. What else can this be?   Is the melatonin working well for me?   What should I do? Any advice?","Doctor":"Hello. If you are suspecting something like sporadic familial insomnia, it is wise to see a neurologist with your specific complaints. This is because it is very difficult to diagnose on the basis of symptoms only. It needs investigations like genetic analysis and sleep studies to confirm. My advice would be to not get overly anxious but to see a neurologist and get investigated properly. Also, melatonin is completely natural and safe and if you were feeling so relieved with it, it is wise to continue it for now.

How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

I want to assure you not to worry as everything is going to be fine if proper care and treatment is opted in for. I have thoroughly gone through your case and can well understand your genuine health concerns. 1. No, there is not much problem right now as he vomited and also had a lot of water. It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases. Because, it is a volatile compound and causes vapors entering the lungs through the airways. 3. As it was only two drops, I do not think it may cause much trouble. If he feels short of breath contact me back, otherwise fine. 1. He should avoid re-exposure. 2. Rule out if there is some sort of suicidal ideation due to depression or anxiety and take him to a psychiatrist for physical evaluation.

For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations. If the size and number of cysts are more, then I suggest consulting a gynecologist as you may require surgery. If the number and size of cysts are less, you may continue treatment along with syrup Evecare 10 ml BD and Kanchnar Guggulu two BD.

As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses.

So, they took me to the hospital and after checking BP, the doctor said it was low. The next day, I got very high fever and came home. Then after some days, I went hostel as I had kidney pain. I was brought here and had a scan. The report said that I have hydronephrosis. So, I joined as a day boarder. While studying I do not understand anything. I got zero in mathematics and I informed my mom that I cannot understand anything. My mom asked me to practice, but I am not getting interest. My exams are getting near and I do not know anything. Whenever there is an exam, I am not going college on that day. Sometimes, when I am alone, I feel something different in my body and I feel as if I am missing the past. When I see a situational scene or a song, I feel bad. I want to make my parents happy by seeing my marks. Please suggest me some ways to interest in studies.","Doctor":"Hi, Welcome to the icliniq.com. I completely understand that you are feeling a lack of interest in studies and unable to focus on your studies. According to research, there can be various reasons behind the lack of interest in studies and low concentration. 1. It can be due to learning difficulties in children. 2. It can be due to negative past experiences such as having failures, something negative related to study environment or teachers or fellows or due to any other academics related factors. 3. There might be psychological causes behind your lack of interest, avoiding exams and getting affected by past memories. You need to specify your age, level of study and for how long you are experiencing these problems, both academic and emotional issues. You also need psychological assessment of the symptoms you mentioned as feeling something different in body, missing past experiences, getting emotional by watching particular scenes or listening songs. First of all you need a complete psychological assessment by a clinical psychologist. It will include testing related to your academic problems and psychological issues like lack of interest, avoid studying, negative past experiences and unusual sensations in the body.  You will get a feedback of your assessment and then you will be better able to understand the reasons of your problem. On the basis of assessment results, your psychologist will recommend an appropriate treatment plan for your academic and emotional problems.  Here, I am advising you a relaxation exercise. You can do it before starting your study. Relaxation exercise helps to improve concentration. It also relaxes your mind and body out of stress and problems.  Do a relaxation exercise or deep breathing to calm yourself and focus. Sit in a comfortable position and close your eyes. Take a deep breath and focus on the air going in and out. Focus on your muscles from head to toe of your feet and relax every muscle. As your body gets completely relaxed, imagine something positive, watch yourself studying and enjoying the material you are reading or writing. After your necessary adjustments open your eyes. Do this exercise every day. I appreciate you consulted for your problems at initial stage. Do get your assessment done as soon as possible. Delay in the treatment or ignoring your symptoms may increase your problems.

The earliest symptom of DVT would be swelling, which is usually unilateral associated with pain. Rash may occur but in later stages and associated with swelling/pain, which may occur due to venous congestion. Also, I guess there are no risk factors for DVT like bedridden state, lower limb surgery, long haul flight, etc. So I do not think this is DVT. Now, why are you on Aspirin and other medications? Do you have any systemic disease which could explain these symptoms? Regarding possible causes, these are inflammatory skin rashes, which may be due to due to allergies, insect bites, viral infections, skin irritation due to clothes and more likely possibility is of drug-induced as you are on medications like Aspirin, etc. So try to correlate with the above-mentioned factors.

How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

I have thoroughly gone through your case and can well understand your genuine health concerns. 1. No, there is not much problem right now as he vomited and also had a lot of water. It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases.

For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations. If the size and number of cysts are more, then I suggest consulting a gynecologist as you may require surgery.

As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses.

Medical abortion is available once a pregnancy is detected via ultrasound (usually around five weeks) up to nine weeks (63 days) gestation. The abortion is achieved using a combination of two medications which work together to terminate a pregnancy. If you feel it is incomplete abortion, I suggest you meet your doctor and get a scan done to confirm that the abortion is complete. If it is not complete, the doctor may advise you what to do next. If it is crossed nine weeks, he may plan a surgical method. Please consult your gynecologist at the earliest. He/she will examine and treat you accordingly.

Before that, the anesthesiologist will administer a general anesthetic as well as a muscle-relaxant to keep me from kicking when under. The procedure also involves administration of something. I am not clear whether it is anesthetic or just oxygen via face mask. Here is my question. I have invested the past couple of years in growing a full, bushy beard. The RN assigned by my HMO told me I would have to shave, or trim down (way down), my beard in order to get a good seal for the mask. Is this really necessary? Is it possible that the nurse was speaking on the basis of a hygienic or even aesthetic concern about my beard rather than on the basis of a sincere concern about the possibility of a little gas (be it anesthetic or oxygen) escaping out the side of the mask? I mean, if the concern is really a hygienic one, I will be happy to shampoo the beard the night before as I had planned to do anyway.","Doctor":"Hi. That is worth a concern for both for your anesthesiologist and you too. Let me elaborate it to you. General anesthesia involves making a person unconscious and making him totally relaxed by giving a medication called muscle relaxant. With unconsciousness and muscle relaxation, a person cannot breathe by himself under general anesthesia so he has to be administered oxygen with help of a bag and mask ventilation supplying positive airway pressure so that his lungs expand during controlled inspiration and relax during passive expiration. Hence this procedure requires a good mask fit on your face so that your anesthesiologist is able to ventilate your lungs with life-sustaining oxygen. Also as I read in your history you are weighing 97.52 kg with a BMI of 41.99. You are considerably overweight which means you would require more concentration of oxygen during general anesthesia. So an overweight patient with a bushy beard is always a challenge for an anesthesiologist. To achieve a good mask fit in such a patient is always difficult in order to provide oxygen and other inhalational anesthetic agents effectively. So, it is not that hygiene is a concern but it is a safe administration of general anesthesia a major concern in your case. I would suggest, consult your anesthesiologist for a spinal anesthesia which involves anesthetizing lower half of your body in which bladder tumor surgery can be performed. This would avoid general anesthesia and would also save your beard.

So, if possible, I suggest you get urine routine, culture and sensitivity report. The above test will diagnose urine infection, if present. Meanwhile, you should drink plenty of fluids, take syrup Cital (Disodium hydrogen citrate) 10 ml in a glass of water three times a day for two weeks and tablet Flavospas (Flavoxate) one tablet in morning and evening for two weeks. The above medication will reduce your itching. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and take medications with their consent.

Virechan is one of the panchakarma therapy where the toxins are eliminated in the form of loose motion. Basti is the other form of panchakarma therapy where different types of enema are used. Nasya is a kind of panchakarma treatment where the oil is poured in the nostrils. Raktamokshan is a procedure of bloodletting.

How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

I have thoroughly gone through your case and can well understand your genuine health concerns. 1. No, there is not much problem right now as he vomited and also had a lot of water. It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases. Because, it is a volatile compound and causes vapors entering the lungs through the airways. 3. As it was only two drops, I do not think it may cause much trouble. If he feels short of breath contact me back, otherwise fine. 1. He should avoid re-exposure. 2.

For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations. If the size and number of cysts are more, then I suggest consulting a gynecologist as you may require surgery. If the number and size of cysts are less, you may continue treatment along with syrup Evecare 10 ml BD and Kanchnar Guggulu two BD.

As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses.

DVT (deep venous thrombosis) that is a blood clot in the legs does not cause burning sensation but causes swelling of the affected leg and you are already on blood thinners. I hope you INR (international normalized ratio) is within therapeutic range unless you are taking new oral anticoagulants.

As some people are allergic to Amoxicillin, in such a case stop the use of the medicine and consult a doctor. Applying ice and washing the area with ordinary soap and water will help with the pain.

In spite of taking the drug properly, she missed her period this month. Is anything wrong with her? What to do now? Does she need to continue the drug? Or should she stop it? I heard that COCP may cause cancer. Is COCP safe for her to use? How long she can use it? Or please prescribe a medication for her which she can continue safely to solve the problem of menstrual irregularity.","Doctor":"Hi. Combined oral contraceptive pill (COCP) is absolutely safe for her. It does not cause cancer (low dose COCP). Just check the content of COCP which she is taking. If dose of Estrogen (Ethinyl estradiol) is 20 or 30 mcg, she can safely continue the medicine. In fact, COCP in such a case prevents endometrial cancer due to its progesterone content. Regarding missed period, it normally does not happen with COCP. Normally period starts between 3 and 15 days of stopping the last tablet in the pack. If it has been more than 15 days since last tablet, consult a gynecologist. If it has been less than 15 days, she can wait till 15 days from last pill for periods to come.

As far as small cysts are concerned they are unmatured eggs which failed to induce menstrual cycle previously, as a result, they got collected in the ovary and they will remain in the ovary. Now, you have got your periods you can start trying for conception. But I advise you to do it under the supervision of a nearby gynecologist because egg size is important while conception and that you can know by ovulation study.

So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations. If the size and number of cysts are more, then I suggest consulting a gynecologist as you may require surgery.

As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses.

It did not go in my stomach. But my teeth are feeling rough even after brushing.What should I do? Will this roughness last for a long time? How should I treat it?","Doctor":"Hi. I have read through your query and the relevant details. The Harpic cleaner contains various chemicals which are acidic and these when exposed to tooth surfaces would cause enamel roughness. That is the reason you have such a feeling in spite of brushing. I cannot guarantee that this roughness will fade away. But, the best home remedy is to do oil pulling twice daily with coconut or gingelly oil and avoiding any acidic food such as lemon or any citrus fruits or fizzy drinks. Apart from these, you could also visit your nearby dentist to get a professional polishing done. It is a special white powder used to polish teeth with a machine called pumice polishing.

Also, MRI report findings include:Small vessel white matter ischemic changes.Chronic lacunar infarct in the right external capsule.Mild cerebral atrophic changes.The Doctor of medicine gave medicines for the treatment of vertigo and nerve but suggested to show immediately to a neurologist.

I have gone through the detailed query and understand your concerns. In my opinion, there is a definite need for face to face consultation as it seems to me that there is a need for cognitive evaluation. The MRI changes observed are indicative of vascular pathology and should be treated if concomitant symptoms are present. Regarding the doubtful observation over MRI, nobody can help with this. Either one sees the MRI report or you get contrast MRI. This will unearth the true pathology of blooming in the parietal and frontal lobes.

My cycles before BCP (Birth Control Pills) were always regular, about 30 days +/- 1 day with a 7 day period. And on BCP, my cycles were always 28 days, with a 5 day period. When I stopped BCP, I had a 5 day period, which began my first cycle of 31 days. The next cycle began with a 6 day period and the cycle lasted 37 days. Then this current cycle, which began with a four day period, a bit lighter than normal. I am currently on CD 27 and I believe I ovulated 3-4 days ago. So, the problem here is that I start spotting on CD 25, along with light cramping. It was only a very little bit of light brown blood, so I did not think much of it. Yesterday, CD 26, I had a little more throughout the day, then quite a bit right before bed. This morning, I am still spotting but much heavier than the past two days, and am starting to get a little alarmed by this. The blood is still brown. Any ideas on why this is happening, presumably 3-4 days past ovulation? Is this cause for concern? I have never spotted ever before. Also, I started taking Vitex at the beginning of this cycle in hopes of shortening my cycle a bit. Thank you in advance for any advice.","Doctor":"Hi. This could be ovulation bleeding. Usually it may take about 6 months to conceive after stopping the birth control pills. But your cycle has become irregular after stopping the pills and it is difficult to predict the ovulation time now. If spotting does not stop or if you experience pain, then you should get an internal scan done to see the cause of spotting. There is possibility of DUB (Dysfunctional Uterine Bleeding) or ectopic pregnancy or threatened abortion. It can be seen once your period date is over. Or you may get beta HCG levels tested to confirm this along with the scan (TVS - Transvaginal Scan). If everything is fine, then you may take progesterone support in the second half of cycle to clear this.

Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time.

She suffered a CVA after a high blood pressure episode, and her BP was 240/120 mmHg. Subsequently, a right side adrenal nodule and Cushing's syndrome were discovered, for which adrenalectomy was performed, following treatment with Glucocorticoid. The cerebral CT performed three years back showed thalamic hemorrhage. Now, she has left-sided spasticity in the leg and arm, left-sided sensory loss, and neuropathic pain. For endocrine problems, she was given Prednisone 5 mg and Synacthen 5 mg.

My friend is under observațion for endocrine problems. For neurological and depression symptoms, she was given Gabaran and Rivotril 0.5 mg, twice a day. Gabaran was interrupted after approximately a month when the pain almost disappeared, but the treatment was resumed after six months when the pain was very strong. This time it had no effect, so the doctor advised her to take Carbamazepine. She took it several weeks with no improvement and interrupted the treatment.

If the size and number of cysts are more, then I suggest consulting a gynecologist as you may require surgery. If the number and size of cysts are less, you may continue treatment along with syrup Evecare 10 ml BD and Kanchnar Guggulu two BD.

She had taken my blood sample and it was negative. But, still I have not gotten my periods and it has been a week ahead. What could be the reason for my late periods?","Doctor":"Hello. As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses.

I received a text message whilst urinating and got out my phone to check whilst I was still urinating and I noticed the back of my phone felt a little damp. I am not sure why it felt damp possibly my hand may have been a little sweaty or I may have got my own pee on my hand a little but I am now really worried in case it was water from the toilet door handle. I am worried as I may have touched my penis with the hand that held the phone.I know I am probably worrying needlessly but wanted to confirm.","Doctor":"Hello. There has been no STD (sexually transmitted disease) identified which can spread through such modes. So, I do not think you need to worry.

Our family friend suggested me to consume Kalarchikai medicine, powdered mixed with pepper and honey to have it for one mandalam (48 days). I have completed nearly 44 days by consuming one small ball of the mixture every morning and before two weeks I got my periods. Then I had checked whether the cysts were dissolved by having an abdomen scan. But still, small multiple follicules have been seen in it with both ovaries enlarged.

See Kalarachi Kai choornam is helpful in amenorrhea. As far as small cysts are concerned they are unmatured eggs which failed to induce menstrual cycle previously, as a result, they got collected in the ovary and they will remain in the ovary. Now, you have got your periods you can start trying for conception. But I advise you to do it under the supervision of a nearby gynecologist because egg size is important while conception and that you can know by ovulation study. Ovulation study is performed under the supervision of a gynecologist. For gall stones, surgical intervention is required generally.

Also Albendazole, if worm infection is suspected. For further doubts consult a hematologist online.--->"},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I am 25 years old. One night, when I tried to go off to sleep, I had racing thoughts that I had no control over. I did not hear any voices, just thoughts. I could not track them or process them. I was really scared as a result. This phenomenon has been happening whenever I try to go off to sleep or wake up from sleep. Now, very recently I moved abroad. I felt extremely depressed and stressed about this. I started having sleep problems all of a sudden. Being a hypochondriac, I thought this must be something fatal. This led me to be stressed, anxious and depressed. I have been searching on the internet obsessively for five months and I came across schizophrenia. I was terrified. Ever since then, I started searching for schizophrenia obsessively and my symptoms worsened. I thought I started to hear voices after reading about them. But actually at most, they are silent thoughts that occasionally mock me. I have random words pop into my mind at odd occasions. After reading about paranoias, I seem to be developing them too. I get scared or threatened by people for no reason. I am more concerned about the fact that why am I getting scared of people, rather than actually scared of them. I feel extremely detached from reality like I am just going through the motions. I am extremely tired and sleepy throughout the day. My appetite has declined completely. I cannot do anything. I visited four doctors and all told me that I have extreme anxiety and depression. Can anxiety and depression cause these symptoms? Can being a hypochondriac lead to this? When I talk to a friend on the phone, I have an engaging conversation, laugh and cheer up. And then I think, should I feel threatened by him? Am I losing control? I speak fluently and I go about my activities fine. Most of the symptoms that I have developed have been after I got to know about the symptoms on the internet and obsessed over them. I constantly cry about what has happened to my life and why did this happen to me. So, what is happening to me? Moreover, these symptoms come and go in 7-10 days.","Doctor":"Hi. I read your query with keen interest and understand your concerns. First of all, I must assure you that there is no evidence of disease called schizophrenia in your case. Schizophrenia is often presented with different kind of prodromal symptoms and they do not match to your current symptoms. Having said this, the symptoms are more indicative of anxiety disorder with added obsessive and compulsive behavior. This is more likely as you are already suffering with hypochondriasis, which is again a disorder from same spectrum of psychiatric disorders like obsessive compulsive disorder. I also like to inform you that stress, anxiety and depression can present with symptoms mentioned in the query and there is no doubt about that. For your clarification worsening of symptoms and spontaneous remission of symptoms are indicative of obsession rather than psychosis such as schizophrenia. In my opinion, it is time for you to engage in therapeutic process rather than moving from one doctor to another as constant approach will bring out the positive outcomes.

It is mainly in the gap where I am missing the tooth. He said it was in other areas around my lower gum but it pretty much wiped off of there. I then went to my dentist who said it was not leukoplakia. I then went to an oral surgeon who also does not believe it is, but says if it is not gone, to get a biopsy. I just wanted your opinion because you have always been right with the oral problems I had. Some of the white lines are raised and hard, but some I was able to scrape off with my fingernail. I also noticed a red spot. So, I am hoping it is not speckled leukoplakia. I did get a VELscope done which was fine. I have an appointment for a brush biopsy but that says not 100 percent. Do you think I should get the brush done or wait to have a real one because the brush biopsy removes the leukoplakia and then it will not be there to get a real one?

I had a CT angiogram last year which was normal. I had an ECG two weeks back which was also normal. When I had a blood test done last week I got to know my cholesterol levels are too high.

I am pleased for your advice.","Doctor":"Hi. From your query I understood your concern. Epigastric pain radiating to back and shoulders should be evaluated for gastric discomforts like gastritis and cholecystitis which is very common in deranged lipid profile. I believe this is due to hyperlipidemia. Your lipid profile is out of proportion. You need to bring these values down. Also you need investigations and thorough assessment to rule out other hereditary causes of hyperlipidemia. Below mentioned measures have to be followed to maintain the cholesterol within range, Management: A good and most important start would be to lose weight at least 15 kg. Your current BMI (body mass index) is 27 which means your are obese, reduce it to less than 25. The key is healthy diet and lifestyle, regular exercise, weight balance, etc. Choose healthier fat like omega 3, omega 6, mono and polyunsaturated fat (olive oil, canola oil, almonds, walnuts, etc) and say good bye to bad cholesterol like saturated fat. Planning diet with limited fat intake will also help. Make sure that you get no more than 300 mg of cholesterol a day. Select grains with more fiber such as wheat, pasta, cornflour, etc. Prefer fresh fruits and vegetables. Avoid processed and canned products as well as fries. Eat heart friendly fish with less fat content like tuna, mackerel, salmon, halibut etc. Avoid alcohol, if impossible keep the intake to minimum and never exceed moderation levels. Avoid smoking. Doing exercise regularly for 45 minutes a day and 250 minutes a week should be your main goal. Artichoke, garlic, oat bran, sitostanol (stigmastanol), blond psyllium, margarines, etc., help. Lipid lowering agents like statin analogues can be considered too. Talk to your doctor for physical examination and let them help you in this regard. 1. Abdominal ultrasound. 2. Serum amylase, lipase, amylase to lipase ratio. 3. Urinary amylase. 4. GI endoscopy. 5. 24 hour pH monitoring. 6. Work up for hereditary causes of hyperlipidemia. 1. Diet and lifestyle modifications. 2. Statin analogues. 3. Symptomatic care. Diet and lifestyle modifications.

How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

I have thoroughly gone through your case and can well understand your genuine health concerns. 1. No, there is not much problem right now as he vomited and also had a lot of water. It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases.

She asked me to wait till due date and then she suggested for C-section. Is there any possibility to avoid C-section?","Doctor":"Hi. Let me give you a few basic facts of pregnancy and delivery. As it is your first pregnancy, the uterus is experiencing the process of delivery for the first time. Baby's head is the only thing in the whole world which can decide if the outlet of your pelvis or the hip bone or the way out through the bone is enough for this baby, it may be different for next baby with different weight. Delivery is not those few hours which you spend in the labor room. The uterus starts to contract more and more frequently, gradually the cervical canal opens, becoming softer day by day and on the part of the baby, the head turns a few mm in angles and directions trying to fit into the bony pelvis. It is like trying to fix a tight cover to a cushion. It has to be manipulated in all different angles till the right angle is got. Usually, God sends baby that fits the mother, unless you have some other problems changing the size of baby or mother's pelvis. It is called engagement. If the size is not fitting well, then baby's head will keep floating above the pelvic bone. If you force it, then it can cause distress in the baby. In this time keep a watch for four things. If none of these are seen, then you can wait till due date and definitely try for vaginal. Happy motherhood in advance. All the best.

I also suggest a deworming medicine tonight and skip Iron tablet. A single dose of 400 mg Albendazole is sufficient. From tomorrow onwards restart the Iron tablets. This should take care of the anemia. With regards to the endometriosis, this is something that can only be confirmed by seeing with the eyes under a laparoscopy. If your doctor wants to take a look under laparoscopy, then you should consider it once your hemoglobin is back up. The advantage is that any endometriotic lesions can be burnt with cautery at the same time and if it is a fibroid which is causing these symptoms, then it can also be treated simultaneously by laparoscopy if it is average sized.

During recent times I am feeling a fear of having liver cancer due to my history of heavy alcoholism. I have mentioned my risk factors below: My body weight is 89Kg and my height is 166cm. I had mumps at an age of 5 years. I have kidney stones (as per the reports attached). I had hepatitis A in 2004. I was a heavy alcoholic from 2008-2012 with a daily intake of almost 300mL hard spirit daily. I reduced alcohol intake after being diagnosed by grade 1 fatty liver in 2013 October.

I have been taking them since last year. Previous to this, and sometimes still, I use Duac 10 mg or 50 mg topically. I used this on my back and face for about a year before the Tetracycline. I was put on Marvelon when I was 15 years old, for acne as a teenager. I was on it until I was 36 years old, with a couple of small breaks to be put on antibiotics because the acne came back. I resorted to the combined pill when I was 35, and I visited a dermatologist since my hairline was receding. They did a biopsy of my hair and told me I had female pattern baldness. When I came off Marvelon two years ago, I lost about three-fourth of my hair. It is traumatizing since I knew I might lose some but just did not realize how much. I was told by doctor after doctor, that it would grow back, and none of them would refer me to a dermatologist about it. I am still waiting to see one, my appointment is after two months. Some of my hair grew back, but it has since fallen out again. My hair and skin distress me all the time. From the research I have done, going on the pill so young and for so long, with female pattern baldness was one of the worst things I could have done, but of course, this was not known back then. My dad had acne his whole life, and my sister has PCOS. My dad also has type 2 diabetes, so I am aware we may have issues in our family with excess androgens. There is hair loss on both sides in the family, male and female. My doctor and dermatologist will not prescribe Spironolactone. I am aware my options for my skin and hair are limited. I have had stomach issues since being on the antibiotics as well as candida in my mouth and vaginally. I take probiotics. I do not want to be on the antibiotics much longer if I am honest, my skin does not heal as well as it should while on them. I am wondering if I am not absorbing my nutrients well enough since my hair is still falling out. Could the Tetracycline be causing more hair loss? I have had my iron tested. My ferritin is about 50, and I take iron when I can since I know it needs to be about 80 for supporting my hair. The doctors here would not test for anything else since they deem my iron and thyroid to be at acceptable levels. I am considering going back on Marvelon again simply to have a break from the antibiotics, and other supplements I am taking and also because maybe it will have a good effect on my hair. What would you recommend? Do you think going back on the combined pill will help my hair grow back or at least stop it from falling out further? Will it fall out again though when I come off of it? I am not in a relationship right now, but it is my hope to still meet someone and have a family. I know my skin was always really good on Marvelon, and my sex drive is not so much. I also wonder, will coming off Tetracycline mean that if I take it in future it would not work again or will take longer to work? Will it cause me problems with building up resistance? I read a lot about how people's acne comes back with a vengeance once they come off. I do not want to start with a treatment such as Minoxidil since there are side effects and it is a lifetime treatment, any gains I make will just fall out again should I decide to have a family. For this reason, I have not tried Accutane, but could not start this until I have seen the dermatologist anyway. I would be concerned with this anyway since I heard it can cause hair loss in itself. I have started derma rolling and use a laser on my hair too. I take silica and MSM for my hair but have not tried Biotin since it can cause acne. I am just very frustrated and sad about the lack of interest or help that is been offered here in my country. Hence, I am asking a question here. Any advice you may have would be really appreciated. Is Marvelon the best to go back? Are there others I could consider, which are also anti-androgen? What are the long term effects of something like Spironolactone?","Doctor":"Hi. For more information consult a dermatologist online -->"},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am 32 year old female. My past medical history includes rosacea (15 years), perioral dermatitis (7 years), melasma and hyperpigmentation in the upper cheeks for three years and ADHD. I am currently under Noritate, occasional Elidel during flare up and Adderall 2.5 mg daily. My hyperpigmentation on my upper cheeks has been progressively getting worse over the last several months. The pigmentation is well demarcated with areas of normal skin. I work indoors and the most sun I get on a daily basis is my short 15 minutes car ride from home to work. I cannot pinpoint the cause of the hyperpigmentation and melasma. I am not on any type of birth control and do not believe the source to be hormonal. I am hesitant to try lightening agents as I have had adverse effects in the past. I am going to trace back the pigmentation for you and maybe you can help me out.Before three years, I applied Noritate and Ziana to my face. My skin in general was fine. I had only one area of pigmentation on my face, right side of face 1 inch x 1 inch. As that was noticeable I asked a dermatologist if there was anything that I could do to lighten it. She gave me Tri-Luma. I decided to put the Tri-Luma on the affected area and also a few freckles on my upper cheeks. The next day I became extremely red and out of fear of triggering my rosacea I dropped Tri-Luma immediately. Then after a month, I stopped taking Ziana, because I moved back to a colder climate and my face was getting too dry.After some eight months, the area of pigmentation (right side of cheek) was started getting darker. So, I decided to give another try for Tri-Luma. I again applied it to the larger area of pigmentation and to the tiny freckles on my upper cheeks. The decision to apply it to the freckles was purely a cosmetic decision. The next day those freckles turned into full blown pigmentation. I immediately stopped the Tri-Luma and the pigmentation in those areas has basically been there up to present day. At that time, a local dermatologist had suggested me to apply some cortisone cream to the areas to lighten them up. The pigmentation subsided very minimally. I did not apply the cortisone cream thereafter. The pigmentation from this point waxed and waned in intensity up until two months back. Then, it has remained prominent. There were a few times during this two year span where my perioral dermatitis flared up and I was told to restart Ziana, which also made the pigmentation worse. I was unsure whether the Ziana was bringing the pigmentation to the surface or whether it was in fact making it worse. I went to two dermatologists who had differing views of stop Ziana and keep using Ziana. I decided to stop as it appeared to be getting noticeably worse. Again, I do not know if this was a whole process of bringing the pigmentation to the surface or not. Please share your thoughts.","Doctor":"Hello. Well, here I discuss everything one by one. For further information consult a dermatologist online -->"},{"Patient":"Hello doctor,I am trying to conceive but my husband and I did cocaine a week ago. How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out.

I feel tired after walking a mere half a kilometer. I walk with the help of a walking stick, because I lose balance while walking. Sometimes I feel orthostatic hypotension. I consulted a cardiologist, a pulmonologist, an endocrinologist and a urologist. Cardiologist took an ECG and an echocardiogram. He ruled out heart trouble even though I had undergone aortic valve replacement six years back. Pulmonologist asked me to take a thoracic CT scan and did not find any significant malignancy of the lungs. Urologist, who 10 years ago diagnosed me having GU AFB and cured me with a six month course of AFB treatment, ruled out recurrence of AFB in GU area. Endocrinologist prescribed various tests like serum cortisol test, thyroid test, ACTH test and ruled out Addison’s or Cushing’s disease. Last week, when I was going through those records, I read in the thoracic CT scan report that my right adrenal gland has hyperplasia. On the internet, I found that hyperplasia means growth of additional cells. Since the previous CT scan was one and a half years old, I decided to have another CT scan of abdomen to find out the condition of my right adrenal gland hyperplasia. I knew that I cannot have an MRI scan as I had a replaced aortic valve.  The radiologist had my serum creatinine tested before administering me with the liquid necessary for contrast. The new CT scan report appeared to me as a death sentence. The report did not find any change in adrenal hyperplasia. But, the report of my kidneys appeared to be concerned. I consulted a nephrologist in a renowned leading hospital in my area. He did not prescribe any treatment for me at all. He even chastised me for taking a CT scan telling me about the radiation effect of the scan and effect on kidneys of the contrast liquid. He asked me to come back after six months. After thinking about it for the past one week I have come to the conclusion that the honorable doctor decided that my kidney condition is terminal and it is futile to prescribe anything.

I consulted a doctor and took tablet Ultracet. I had vomiting and hence stopped the medication. Then I had tablet Pregabalin 650 (one dose) and had giddiness and so, stopped the medication. Neck movement was there to some extent and was not severe. I did physiotherapy once (pressing the head down by the therapist). Was then not able to swallow the food, and there was tightness and felt like something was stuck in the neck and had heaviness while breathing. I consulted doctor after 2 days and took tablet Hifenac on the first day and tablet Tolperisone 150mg (one dose). I then had loose motion on the second day and therefore stopped this medication too. I had blood test done before twenty days. As per the report vitamin D was less than 3, calcium was 8.3, vitamin B12 was 238 and hemoglobin was 11.9. After 10 days I went to the doctor and I had Tolperisone twice daily for 3 days. Again I went to the doctor after 2 days and had Arachitol injection and tablet Limcee for a day. I had acidity with Limcee and stopped that. I had 2 tablets of FLAX-369 for 2 days, one tablet each day. After 7 days I had one tablet Uprise. Two hours after taking this tablet, there was tightness in the jaw movement. After 7 days I had one more tablet Uprise. There was slowness in walking and heaviness in the right leg. I had one more injection of Arachitol after 20 days. Still then I have more difficulty in climbing stairs and walking. I cannot lift up my right leg.

I am sorry to know that you are suffering with multiple problems related to thinking and inhibition. Before saying anything I must assure you that vitamin B12 is not known to cause any of the mentioned symptoms and we need to find out the alternative reason for causation of these symptoms. They can be due to autism itself or may be due to other psychopathology that has been arising due to autism.

So far it has not been a success, and the main reason is I have irregular periods and difficulty tracking my fertile window. I have been tracking my ovulation this month, and according to calculations this week I should be ovulating. So this whole week I kept checking my cervical mucus and did some ovulation tests. The last five days my ovulation tests all came back negative until today. I saw only a faint line. But from here I got very confused. The reason is, according to my knowledge, if you reach your ovulation your cervical mucus should also change to a watery, slimy, or egg consistency. When I check my mucus it is grainy and white, which probably refers to yeast infection but I have no other symptoms. No burning feeling, or any itching or bad smells. Just white grainy mucus. Does this mean I do have a yeast infection, even though I have no other symptoms? Can this affect my chance to get pregnant?","Doctor":"Hello,  Welcome to iclinq.com. Yeast infections are usually associated with symptoms like itching or pain. The description of the mucus looks more like an ovulatory discharge. The discharges are not always bookish, it varies with individuals and patterns may have some changes during active sexual life. So do not worry and have regular intercourse during this time as it is the fertile period. Generally, timed intercourse adds stress to both partners, so have casual stress free sex, it actually makes wonders. I hope this helps. Ovulatory discharge. Ovulatory discharge."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor,I am trying to conceive but my husband and I did cocaine a week ago. How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases. Because, it is a volatile compound and causes vapors entering the lungs through the airways. 3. As it was only two drops, I do not think it may cause much trouble.

For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations. If the size and number of cysts are more, then I suggest consulting a gynecologist as you may require surgery.

As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves.

But I do not know which one it is. I also get pain in the groin area. I have genital warts with skin growth, itching, and burning. I also got the white spot in the throat before 14 years back.","Doctor":"Hi. I have gone through the attachment (attachment removed to protect patient identity). Your current problem appears to be upper respiratory tract infection. It is a common problem, and many individuals get these infections. These are viral, and our immunity clears them. Now, you should get your throat examined and upload a picture of it. You will need antibiotics like tablet Azithromycin 500 mg once a day along with some antacid like tablet Pantoprazole 40 mg before breakfast once a day for five days. Also, have Betadine (Povidone-iodine) gargles four times a day. For a cough, you can have syrup Alex (Dextromethorphan with Guaifenesin) two teaspoons whenever needed up to three times a day. Avoid cold food items. Now, whenever you get these symptoms, you should use Betadine gargling three times a day to kill these viruses and for the prevention of infection. Having recurrent sore does not necessarily mean that you have low immunity. Also, getting typhoid once in six months is likely a false diagnosis. If you are getting any viral fever too, the result of typhoid test will be positive. Also, when you are infected with typhoid, it remains positive throughout the life. So there are specific tests like Typhidot IgM to look for the current infection. You likely have HPV (human papillomavirus) warts. You should get yourself examined by a local Gynecologist and should undergo pap smear testing. These warts can be destroyed with medicines or removed with minor surgery. I guess you do not have any white discharge or so. For more information consult an internal medicine physician online -->"},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I am a 23 year old non-diabetic male.

On checking the Gram stain of the ulcer exudates, short, plump, gram-negative rods in the classic school of fish appearance, if revealed indicates a chancroid. Get your HSV (herpes simplex virus), IgG and IgM (herpes simplex virus immunoglobulin G and M) level tested to confirm herpes.

Recently, I have had things that look like mouth ulcers. I am worried about tonsil cancer. Does this look like it? I am currently taking Zoloft and Adderall.","Doctor":"Hello. Chronic tonsillitis is a recurrent infection of the tonsils. Tonsils are lymphoid tissue present in the throat. They act as drainage points of various structures in the throat. When they get infected, they cause pain, soreness, headache, fever, and malaise. Tonsils drain into jugulodigastric nodes in the neck. Hence, an infection swells up the neck nodes as well. Malignancy will cause loss of appetite, loss of weight, in addition to a lack of fever or pain. Unilateral tonsil swelling points towards cancer. However, in your case, the findings of congestion in tonsils, congested anterior pillars, congested pharyngeal structures, and swollen nodes point towards tonsillitis rather than cancer.

She had a neck schwannoma tumor, and that was completely removed by surgery. Post surgery, my friend could not eat or drink anything. Her voice was hoarse as well. ENT doctor followed up her and noted that her right vocal chord was paralyzed, but not the left. For her feeding, they installed a G-tube in the abdomen to give her feed from as she could not tolerate it through her mouth or nose. The ENT did the micro laryngoscopy and gave her a temporary injection to bring her right vocal chord closer, so her voice improves and encourage water intake. After three days of this procedure, she tried in the evening time to drink water and little by little; she finished half a glass. She has too much gagging that gives her a feeling of choking. When she clears her throat, the gagging looks like super sticky clear glue, and she constantly has it. The next morning she tried to drink water little by little, but she was getting aspiration. So, she got discouraged and depressed to a severe level. It is now 48th day since the removal of her tumor, and there does not seem to be any sign of her swallowing. I want to know if this is temporary or permanent. We got a couple of opinions from doctors that we sent her surgery report to and they think she can recover anytime between three to six months. The doctor who did the surgery is a vascular surgeon, and he also believes that she will recover from two to three months and will start eating and drinking slowly. I have asked the doctor about the nerve damage or cut. He said that he was not sure about the exact nerve, but seemed like a branching nerve. When I asked him if it was 10th or 12th nerve, he said it was the 12th branching nerve. The ENT doctor said 10th nerve, and it can be permanent damage. The vascular surgeon did say that they repaired the nerve and did not leave it like that. She is currently on Lorazepam, Sodium bicarbonate, Cotazym, Tylenol, Centrum and Ranitidine. At this point, I do not know what to believe anymore and what to think. I believe nerve specialists are neurologists and hence, I am here. Any of your help would be greatly appreciated.

How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases.

For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations. If the size and number of cysts are more, then I suggest consulting a gynecologist as you may require surgery.

As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves.

It is already more than a week and still no period. I have taken two pregnancy tests on different days and both were negative. I am supposed to start my cycle again on the 11th. I am just waiting for that day. But I still do not understand the one time spotting on that Wednesday morning. Please advise.","Doctor":"Hello. It is assumed from the history that you normally have a regular period and this has been the first time that your periods had been delayed. The spotting which you experienced on April 1st was probably scanty menses in the form of spotting and it was associated with premenstrual symptoms and also it was your natural due date. Sometimes menses are delayed or women experience reduced flow due to stress induced hormonal imbalances which can affect the cycle during the month. The stress factor can be physical, social, emotional or psychological and all have a bearing on the hormonal balance. So it is fairly common though that progesterone withdrawal was not initiated adequately and that the next menses may be heavier if at all.  As the pregnancy has been ruled out completely, the reason is stress induced. I suggest you to get an ultrasound pelvis done to check for endometrial thickness of the uterus and if it is more than or equal to 10mm, then you may opt for a withdrawal bleed with progestins (available on prescription) to resume your menses within 7 days of taking the last dose. Following which you may practice or incorporate stress busting techniques in your lifestyle to reduce the stress like meditation or yoga which are known to be helpful. That should keep your hormones in balance and such episodic delays with regards to menses which can be further distressful, can be avoided.  Wish you good health.

It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases.

For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations. If the size and number of cysts are more, then I suggest consulting a gynecologist as you may require surgery.

She had taken my blood sample and it was negative. But, still I have not gotten my periods and it has been a week ahead. What could be the reason for my late periods?","Doctor":"Hello. As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses.

What should I use at this stage to avoid scars? Looking at the pictures, will it leave any scar? How long will it take to go away?","Doctor":"Hello. Chickenpox takes around two weeks to get scabbed off. Since as per your query, if it already formed a crust, then now it will scab off soon. Do not touch it or scratch it. Otherwise, there will be high chances for scars on the face. The treatment you were taking is entirely correct, and you need not apply any particular thing on that.

What can I do, so that I do not need to take anti-allergic medications?","Doctor":"Hi. The allergic symptoms usually aggravate during winter season. It continues from November till February based on the climate in your place.  You have not mentioned about the allergic site (nose or lung or skin). If it is nose or lung, the dryness due to winter can trigger the allergic response in nose. In this situation, you need to maintain moisture by just applying a drop of coconut oil in each nostril before going to bed. On the other hand, you can apply a drop of Anu Thailam (an ayurvedic nasal drops for allergy) in each nostril before going to bed. During evenings and nights, when it is too cold, you need to protect your ears (by keeping cotton plug), nose (by applying oil drops), head (by covering head with a woolen cap) and hands and feet (by wearing gloves and socks). The external cold stimulus triggers the allergic response. So, prevent yourself from the cold stimulus to avoid allergy. If you have allergic asthma, then it is better to practice pranayama and yoga. Breathing exercises will help you. If you have allergic skin disorder, then you can use vaseline or vegetable oils to gently apply on the skin. This helps in overcoming the dryness due to the cold climate. The skin manifestation should also be examined by a physician to decide the proper medication.

My bowel movement was good enough that I had to wake up to go and felt quite empty, except sometimes I had to go in the evening and also no farts. I then moved to a new place and I think the water changed; still I was quite fine with two times bowel movements. I then moved to another place due to work where the water was not quite good in taste. I stayed in the same place for about 15 months. Here, my BM changed and I did not use to get the feeling of complete emptiness. I had to go in the evening every day. After a bowel movement, I used to get lots of burps and farts in the night. Now, I have moved back to the place where I was 4 years ago, but my current situation is still the same. When I wake up, I do not get the normal urge for bowel movement. When I go to the toilet, initially, I will get farts and then stools. Though I go to restroom for three times in a day, I do not get the feel of emptiness. Is this IBS?

I was then made to urinate in a cup and ultrasound of the testes. After the ultrasound it was concluded that I did not need surgery which is a relief, and I am thankful for this. I then had an appointment to see a urologist. Soon after however, I noticed that my testes were smaller than usual. When I saw the urologist I told him what happened and he conducted a prostate exam. Based on the pain I was experiencing due to the prostate exam, he diagnosed me with prostatitis. He prescribed me a course of antibiotics (Tarivid). He told me that these things are common in sexually active young men. However, I have not been sexually active since last five months. I have now come to the conclusion that I have STD (most likely chlamydia) from my last encounter as it was high risk. I received unprotected oral sex from a sex worker. I presented no symptoms and so I did not go see a doctor earlier. However, it was now mentioned by the doctors as orchitis or epididymitis. I think the former is what I experienced. My question is will the size of the testes recover if testosterone function is impaired? Is there any risk of infertility?

How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

The swelling occurs due to various reasons. It can occur due to a toothache or carious tooth in the same region. It can be due to trauma, sinusitis due to nose infection, and due to a bite of insects. But most probably, it is a case of dentoalveolar abscess due to a carious tooth. This abscess can pass into soft tissues like cheeks and can cause swelling. The space in the cheek is so large, so you can feel less pain when you touch it. It can compress the nerves and can create pain. Take tablet Ordent (Ofloxacin and Ornidazole) twice a day for five days, tablet Zerodol SP (Aceclofenac, Paracetamol and Serratiopeptidase) twice a day for three days, and tablet Pantoprazole 40 mg once a day for one week.

The troubles with vision are a clinical sign of optic neuritis too.

Because, it is a volatile compound and causes vapors entering the lungs through the airways. 3. As it was only two drops, I do not think it may cause much trouble. If he feels short of breath contact me back, otherwise fine. 1. He should avoid re-exposure. 2. Rule out if there is some sort of suicidal ideation due to depression or anxiety and take him to a psychiatrist for physical evaluation.

I used it for 30 days continuously, but no use. How many days should I take that powder and how to overcome this problem?","Doctor":"Hello. For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations. If the size and number of cysts are more, then I suggest consulting a gynecologist as you may require surgery. If the number and size of cysts are less, you may continue treatment along with syrup Evecare 10 ml BD and Kanchnar Guggulu two BD.

As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses.

But, for the past 12 years, my brain and body get tired very easily. I am having mental and physical exhaustion and the condition is gradually worsening. I feel drowsy after studying for some time. With this problem, my studies have dropped a lot. I get very easily fatigued by doing just 15% of normal work for this age.

How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations. If the size and number of cysts are more, then I suggest consulting a gynecologist as you may require surgery.

As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses.

If you do not have difficulty with intercourse and your partner is satisfied then I do not think there is a need for any medications. (medications has a limited role and has side effects too). If you feel there is phimosis (inability to retract foreskin) get circumcision done. It is is a very basic procedure and will let you to urinate better. Moreover, there is no hygiene-related problems after circumcision. You can try some non invasive methods to increase the size and strength such as penile pump, jelquing in this when penis is erect apply any lubricant (oil) around base of the shaft and milk towards the end.

How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

He vomited and had lot of salt water. Please advice for any side effect.","Doctor":"Hi. I want to assure you not to worry as everything is going to be fine if proper care and treatment is opted in for. I have thoroughly gone through your case and can well understand your genuine health concerns. 1. No, there is not much problem right now as he vomited and also had a lot of water. It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases. Because, it is a volatile compound and causes vapors entering the lungs through the airways. 3. As it was only two drops, I do not think it may cause much trouble. If he feels short of breath contact me back, otherwise fine. 1. He should avoid re-exposure. 2. Rule out if there is some sort of suicidal ideation due to depression or anxiety and take him to a psychiatrist for physical evaluation.

For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations. If the size and number of cysts are more, then I suggest consulting a gynecologist as you may require surgery.

She had taken my blood sample and it was negative. But, still I have not gotten my periods and it has been a week ahead. What could be the reason for my late periods?","Doctor":"Hello. As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses.

It made me quite worried, because they were definitely something new. I have a family history of sudden death from hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. So, I decided to have an echo and a 24 hour Holter monitor. The echo showed that structurally my heart is fine and according to the Holter monitor results I had dozens of PVCs (some of them were couplets), a few PACs and sinus tachycardia. My blood test results were normal, too. A couple of days later PVCs began to occur not only during rest, but also during exercise, which really scared me. One day while walking home, I had some kind of bigeminy (every other beat was abnormal) that almost took my breath away. Therefore, I wanted to get a stress test on a stationary bicycle just in case. I had some singular PVCs at an intensity level of 120 watts with the heart rate of 164.

You both have the same blood group and can conceive without any fear. There is no worry regarding same blood group.  The point that should be kept in mind is if your wife has a negative group and the child is Rh positive, then to prevent hemolysis in the second child, an anti-D injection is given. It is good that you are alert regarding pre-conception counseling. You and your wife need to do CBC (complete blood count) with PS (peripheral smear). I am advising this because if there are microcytic hypochromic red blood cells and the RBC mass is high, then HPLC (high-performance liquid chromatography) should be done to rule out hemoglobinopathy, especially thalassemia minor.

How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

He was diagnosed with idiopathic hypersomnia through the spinal tab, five years ago. He is now taking Adderall 60 mg a day total, spread over six times, and is using Flumazenil cream, which has given a very good result, it seems stable for now. He also takes an antidepressant for depression from the past eight years. He also had a bicuspid aortic valve at birth, but it was only diagnosed in adulthood, and it has caused no symptoms so far. I am just wondering what are the risks of him developing any serious illness in the next ten years. I am particularly concerned about his IH. Is IH a serious disorder beyond social and professional consequences? Since it is a neurological disorder, is he at a higher risk for neurodegenerative diseases in the future like PD, REM behavior disorder, Alzheimer's, dementia, MS, ALS, MSA, neuropathy, sleep apnea, or other serious neurological and sleep disorders? I have heard that depression and sleep disorders (like RBD) are risk factors for these neurological disorders. I have heard that taking Adderall long term is also a risk factor for PD in a new study. How might his multiple medications interact with each other or contribute to these risk factors? Does having idiopathic hypersomnia predispose him to develop REM behavior disorder in the future? What are the early signs of REM behavior disorders? Research shows that RBD is a reliable precursor to predict PD in the next 5 to 12 years, what are your opinions on his susceptibility to RBD (and by implication, PD) due to idiopathic hypersomnia? Are they in any way related? He does not have symptoms of REM behavior disorder as far as I am aware of, though he sometimes does have some periodic minor twitching or jerking while asleep, is it a side effect of antidepressant? Could it be PLMD? Does PLMD tend to lead to RBD? How big of a deal is depression? He shows no symptoms at all with his medications. I have general anxiety disorder and take Xanax once in a while, and I know that medications are not magic. I am just wondering if he is silently feeling sad all the time, even if the medicines make it more manageable to go through daily lives. He has been on it for eight years, and he said if he stops taking them for a couple of days, he starts to \\"feel it\\" again. Will he ever be cured completely? Will his BAV more likely to develop into other cardiovascular diseases like hypertension, high cholesterol, sudden death, enlarged heart, stenosis, leakage, calcification, etc.? At what point will he require surgery and how will that affect his hypersomnia and Adderall intake? Is it possible that he might never be able to take Adderall again at some point? What is the prognosis of his situation in your opinion? Can he exercise hard? I am also wondering about the inheritability of idiopathic hypersomnia, depression, and BAV. Lastly, I am just wondering if these conditions should be a major cause for concerns for me as a partner with whom he has a potential future and family with. What should I expect in regards to potential behavioral change, psychosis, and sexual dysfunction? And how should I support?","Doctor":"Hi. Idiopathic hypersomnia is a sleep disorder even less common than narcolepsy, a rare sleep disease. The biggest distinguishing characteristics include differences in REM (rapid eye movement) sleep, the absence of cataplexy (a sudden weakness in the muscles while fully conscious, usually triggered by strong emotion like laughter or anger) and, perhaps most unfortunately (for me and fellow IHers), the lack of refreshment post-napping in idiopathic hypersomnia. Excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS) is the severe difficulty sustaining full alertness even during active and stimulating situations and the high probability of falling asleep inadvertently during sedentary activities. The social and professional consequences are as follows: Stimulants like Adderall (combination of Amphetamine and Dextroamphetamine) raises the body temperature, heart rate, and blood pressure, and repeated use or abuse, particularly in high doses, can create a range of medical issues from a stroke to a seizure to a heart attack. Adderall can cause damage to the heart and cardiovascular system when used for a prolonged period of time, especially when used in excess. The most common ADHD (attention deficit hyperactivity disorder) medication cardiovascular problems reported are hypertension (high blood pressure) and tachycardia (irregular heart rate). Sudden cardiac death may also be a potential side effect of Adderall. Other side effects of abusing Adderall long-term include: Using Adderall heavily for a long period of time increases all the risk factors and potential long-term side effects, which may get progressively worse.

Except for low blood pressure, I am in generally perfect health with mild benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) that has not been getting noticeably worse lately but, has been present for years. While my stream is certainly not like when I was younger, I have no difficulty in voiding other than it takes more time and I do not have to urinate frequently (considering the amount of liquid intake). The stream is enhanced to relatively normal with low-dose saw palmetto and 5 mg Tadalafil. I do drink plenty of water. On following a dietary shift away from red and white meat (still consuming fish and eggs) with plenty of fruits and vegetables, I began producing sand in my urine which prompted me to see a urologist. The urologist insists this condition is caused by excessive urinary retention due to BPH. On my volition, I had the sand analyzed to determine it was 100 % carbonate apatite, which I know from basic chemistry, precipitates in alkaline pH. With a pH meter, I learned my urine was often 8+ which I have corrected with dietary changes (based on PRAL score) and L-methionine if needed and monitor throughout the day to keep it mildly acidic. This has alleviated the stone formation. A digital exam at the routine physicals with multiple doctors has elicited no concerns, stating either no or mild enlargement felt. However, CT scan reportedly reveals lateral enlargement. Multiple ultrasounds show that my bladder retention currently is not excessive (9 to 30 cc) but, a recent UroCuff test indicates a bladder pressure of 260\\" H20 (with the meds mentioned above) with no accompanying abdominal muscle activity (no pushing). My flow is quite good with what I am presently taking, something I would characterize as pretty normal for a healthy adult male. It is just that apparently to achieve that flow my bladder is quite muscular. I do not feel like I am straining at all when voiding, just relaxed. The urologist insists that a prostate surgery (microwave) is needed to correct the BPH and alleviate the higher than normal bladder pressure and he thinks I will still have future stone formation if it is not corrected. He says that an elevated bladder pressure is damaging on the bladder. He states he is supported by cystoscopy that reveals pronounced striations on the interior wall, which for all I know are rugae. He characterized it as visually the bladder of an 80 year old. I do not wish to subject myself to unnecessary surgery with all its associated risks and side effects. What is the risk, (if any) associated with elevated bladder pressure? Is surgery really warranted considering the present lack of significant impact on my lifestyle? My main concern is, in the case of no perceived functional problems, is the elevated bladder pressure actually harmful to the bladder or kidneys? Or is it just like any other muscle that simply develops in response to use and is harmless compensation.","Doctor":"Hello. I have gone through your history.

Eight months before, she had ear discharge. It was diagnosed as acute otitis media and she was treated with antibiotics such as Lindacin, etc. A week after the completion of antibiotics, again she had the same problem for about three months. Then, the ENT specialist decided to clean the mastoid. Since then, she has been getting fever once in every month. It has been six months now and the 6th time she is taking antibiotics. The blood results are always showing that there is a bacteria, but never detected the location. The fever goes up to 40 and 40.1 degree Celsius. In addition, Paracetamol does not lower the fever and Ibuprofen keeps her only three hours. So, I normally do the rotation with Voltaren. We recently got a strep test for mouth, ear and nose. The nose strep had a bacteria called Moraxella catarrhalis. Would this bacteria cause such a problem? Would the CRP be so high due to this? How is it possible that such bacteria was not cured taking so many antibiotics for such a long time? Can you please advise me what should I do further? I am really worried.","Doctor":"Hi. Co-trimoxazole and Tetracyclines are the drugs of choice in Moraxella catarrhalis as the rate of resistance to these agents is currently less.

How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

I have thoroughly gone through your case and can well understand your genuine health concerns. 1. No, there is not much problem right now as he vomited and also had a lot of water. It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases. Because, it is a volatile compound and causes vapors entering the lungs through the airways. 3. As it was only two drops, I do not think it may cause much trouble. If he feels short of breath contact me back, otherwise fine. 1. He should avoid re-exposure. 2.

For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations. If the size and number of cysts are more, then I suggest consulting a gynecologist as you may require surgery. If the number and size of cysts are less, you may continue treatment along with syrup Evecare 10 ml BD and Kanchnar Guggulu two BD.

As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses.

However, I am also on birth control pills due to bad endometriosis. Will the DHEA and Ubiquinol still work while on the pill? I have had two failed IVF cycles.","Doctor":"Hello. How are you doing? Birth control pills are a combination of estrogen and progesterone hormones. They just prevent the ovulation and have no effects on the actions of the DHEA and Ubiquinol. You can have them both at the same time. If I may advise, you already have a lot of risk factors. Your age is at the upper limit for the healthy reproductive age, two failed IVFs and endometriosis. These medicines have a limitation. They cannot regenerate new eggs from the ovaries. They are supposed to awaken the sleeping or hidden eggs. But at this age, the quality of eggs will be compromised. Also, the endometriosis would have damaged few eggs. The ideal and best option to get pregnant would be to go for donor IVF. You can have donor eggs with your partner's sperms, embryos, and your name. I suggest you suppress the endometriosis completely with injection Leuprolide, then transfer the embryos when the endometrium is thick enough. This way neither the poor egg quality nor the endometriosis will affect the pregnancy outcome. You will definitely have a healthy pregnancy. Hope I have clarified your query. Do write back if any more queries. All the best.

One says my boy has Hirschsprung's disease, and the other says it is just constipation. The first doctor did a rectal exam, yielding no explosive stools, and he wants my son to get a barium enema. The second doctor did not do a rectal exam and just felt my boy's stomach, and said it is not hard and has good bowel sounds. She told me to up his apple juice or water to 8 oz per day with probiotics. KUB was done and shows lots of stool in the large intestine, so the doctor told me to give Miralax and liquid suppository. My son did have suppository a week before the visits with hard poop smear in each diaper ever since. During that time, I had been reporting to my first doctor about my son's constipation. My son started with gentle solids at six months. He is today exactly 8 months old, weighs 21 lbs, and has over 90 % growth in the growth chart. He does not have weight issues. He never had a fever, no blood in stools, has passed his meconium, and had a few projectile vomiting in his lifetime. My son does not fit the HD diagnosis, but my doctor says because of the rectal exam yielding no explosive stool it means it is stuck in the large GI. Is there harm in performing barium enema? My son already had an x-ray, which shows lots of stool in the large intestine. I also just gave him Pedia-Lax, and he had a good bowel movement for the first time since two weeks. I am attaching a picture. I will give him Miralax this weekend with 8 oz liquid a day with probiotics and no solids for now. Is barium enema an old school method? I am so torn because the first doctor in a specialist and has 50 years of experience, and he is adamant that my son has HD even after consulting with his colleagues. Could this just be a bad case of constipation? Maybe, I did not insert the first suppository correctly, and maybe my son did not get enough liquid this whole time, this second liquid suppository really helped. The second doctor has eight years experience, and she is so conservative. She does not want to give a rectal exam or even suppository. She says my son is at a low risk and does not have HD. Should I see a gastroenterologist or my son before we proceed with the barium enema or should we just get it done at this point and see the results? I just did not read anything about a barium enema after online research.","Doctor":"Hi. There seems to be a lot of confusion that has been created.

Kindly suggest me what I can do further. I got married before one and a half years and I am much worried about my pregnancy. I have gallstones as well.","Doctor":"Hello. I just read your query. See Kalarachi Kai choornam is helpful in amenorrhea. As far as small cysts are concerned they are unmatured eggs which failed to induce menstrual cycle previously, as a result, they got collected in the ovary and they will remain in the ovary. Now, you have got your periods you can start trying for conception. But I advise you to do it under the supervision of a nearby gynecologist because egg size is important while conception and that you can know by ovulation study. Ovulation study is performed under the supervision of a gynecologist. For gall stones, surgical intervention is required generally. Medicine is not of much help."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I am suffering from disc bulge at the level of L5-S1. It causes pressure at nerve root for past two months. I am under treatment but no satisfactory improvement in these two months. Please help.","Doctor":"Hi. You have mentioned from MRI findings as L5/S1 disc bulge, instability at L5/S1 level and pars defect of L5 with likely compression of both exiting L5 nerve roots. I would like to know few more details such as, Revert back with your MRI and x-ray films to a spine surgeon online -->"},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I have a small lump on the right side of my neck near the cervical area. I have been having this for the last one month. Although I am on treatment, the lump has not gone. The doctor took out the pus from the infected area, and the laboratory reports confirmed it as tuberculosis. In that regard, I would like to ask how much time it will take to dissolve this lump? What are the remedies?","Doctor":"Hi.

Also, I am a bit uncomfortable as all day it feels like I have not cleared my bowel activities for the day. Recently, about four days back, I noticed blood along with my stool. It was full red in color and fresh. Also, to mention that from last two weeks my stool was very hard. So, I doubt if it is a case of internal tear in the stool passing line and not a serious case of piles. But to add, these days I am feeling a bit uncomfortable near my anus and some sort of itching type, but not exactly itching. Today morning, I saw five to six fresh blood drops and then only stool passed out. I touched my anus with my finger and found fresh and red blood in my fingers. I also found one small blood clot near the anal area. I am really worried about this. Please help me with this. About 9 years back, the same kind of problem happened. But, my father took me to a doctor and as far I remember the doctor gave me two ointments for application inside the anus. Then after a few days I was fine. Kindly help me and let me know if you want to know anything more.","Doctor":"Hi. I am sorry to hear that you are having these concerns. Fresh red blood in your stools may come from any one of the following: For further information consult an internal medicine physician online -->"},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, Eighteen months ago, I had a reconstructive surgery on my penis to treat penile curvature. Two weeks post operation, hematoma exploded so I got wound breakdown. Skin necrosis ensued and I lost a small part of my penile skin. No graft or flap was used. I now have hyperpigmentation and very noticeable wound scar. For the hyperpigmentation, I have been using Hydroquinone and Mederma Intense Patch. I have been using it for two weeks. There is an improvement but the skin is getting sensitive, red, and inflamed. Should I still use it? If not, how to remove hyperpigmentation from the penis skin? What about the wound scar? Will it shrink and disappear with time or there are other solutions? I need to know what I can do to remove both hyperpigmentation and wound scar from the penis skin. I have attached pictures for reference.","Doctor":"Hello. It is good that you have explained the condition in full detail and with good quality pictures (attachment removed to protect patient identity). First of all, the Hydroquinone used over the skin especially over the thin penile skin does have side effects. I advise you not to use it for more than 15 days with a month's gap in between. If it is along with any kind of steroid then not more than 10 days. The scar seems to be still in an immature state. I suggest the onion peel based ointment such as the Contractubex Gel should work. You can use it twice daily. For more information consult a plastic surgeon online -->"},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I am a 28 year old male. I have had severe acid reflux and stomach bloating three times in the past 12 months. It started suddenly each time. There is no prior symptom. This is the third time and it has been going on for a month. During the first time, I treated myself with antacids (Calcium carbonate) and a two week cycle of Nexium with probiotics. When it came back for the second time, I had Pepsin and Betaine hydrochloride, probiotics for a month. It worked very well. Five months later, it came back for the third time now. I have had no acid reflux, but just bloating. I am taking Betaine HCl and Pepsin, but it is not going away. I will start to bloat right after my first bite of food. Even drinking water too fast will make it. The bloating is bad. I have severe bloating and pressure for hours after I eat. I think my stomach is not producing any acid. Could it be like that?","Doctor":"Hello. You described two different entities here. CT scan of abdomen and upper gastrointestinal (GI) endoscopy. 1. Indigestion. 2. Hiatus hernia. 3. Esophagitis.
