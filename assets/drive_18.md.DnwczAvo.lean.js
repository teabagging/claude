Analyzing the Options:   - Option A and B Analysis: For an arithmetic progression with first term a_1 and common difference d, the sum of the first n terms, T_n, can be expressed as T_n = frac{d}{2} cdot n^2 + left(a_1 - frac{d}{2}right) cdot n. Thus, f(n) = |T_n| = left|frac{d}{2} cdot n^2 + left(a_1 - frac{d}{2}right) cdot nright|.

This is because an arithmetic progression does not guarantee a monotonically decreasing function in absolute value for large n.3.

ThenA V=A C+C V=A C+A Dis the last term of the ratio pair (2). Since on the other hand angle B A C = angle D A C, therefore, due to (2), triangle A B C and triangle A D V are similar triangles. But in the first one, B C = A C, so in the second one, D V = D A = C V, thus triangle C D V is also an isosceles triangle, and angle C V D = angle C A D.Accordingly, the reflection of V over the line C D, denoted as U, lies on the circumcircle k of the polygon S, and it is the last vertex of S when traversing A B C D ldots, because the reflection makes the quadrilateral C V D U a rhombus; U D is a chord of k parallel to A C, so A U = C D, as the chords corresponding to parallel arcs. Furthermore, D U = C V = D A, so the perpendicular bisector of the side A U of the polygon passes through D and the center of k. Thus, reflecting the broken line A B C D over f, the vertex A maps to U, D remains in place, and the vertices B, C map to the missing vertices of S. We have thus constructed all the vertices of S, obtaining 7 vertices, so the number of sides of S can only be 7.

Let the number of sides of the polygon S be n. The problem mentions 4 vertices, so n geq 4. For a regular quadrilateral, A B = A D, so (1) cannot hold, hence n > 4. Let the vertex of S following D be E, the intersection of the lines A B and C D be M (which exists because n > 4); and let the lengths of the segments A B, A C, A D, A E be denoted by b, c, d, e respectively. Since S is symmetric with respect to the perpendicular bisector of B C, the triangle M B C is isosceles: M B = M C = m. The angles at A in triangles A M C and A D E are inscribed angles corresponding to equal chords, and angle A C M is the exterior angle of the cyclic quadrilateral A C D E, so it is equal to angle A E D, thus triangles A M C and A D E are similar. Therefore, on the one hand, A M: M C = A D: D E, and on the other hand, M C: A C = D E: A E, that is,(b+m): m = d: b, quad m: c = b: eFrom the first, frac{b}{m} = frac{d}{b} - 1, so from the second,e = c frac{b}{m} = cleft(frac{d}{b} - 1right) = c dleft(frac{1}{b} - frac{1}{d}right)We note that so far we have not used (1), the derived relationship is valid for any n > 4. According to our notation, (1) implies that 1 / c stands in the parentheses, so e = d. Thus, triangle A D E is an isosceles triangle. - The completion of the solution is identical to the one above.István Siklósi (Budapest, Berzsenyi D. Gymnasium, 4th grade)Remark. The trigonometric equivalent of our solution is as follows.Let the center of S be O, the diameter of the circumcircle be 1, and angle A O B = 2 omega. Then b = sin omega, c = sin 2 omega, d = sin 3 omega, e = sin 4 omega, so (1) leads to the equationfrac{1}{sin omega} = frac{1}{sin 2 omega} + frac{1}{sin 3 omega}To solve this, we use the identity corresponding to (3)sin 4 omega = sin 2 omega sin 3 omega left(frac{1}{sin omega} - frac{1}{sin 3 omega}right)This identity can also be verified independently: multiplying and rearranging, we get the identitysin 4 omega + sin 2 omega = 2 cos omega sin 3 omegawhich is correct based on the known identity for the sum of sines of two angles. Now, (5) leads to (4) being the equation sin 4 omega = sin 3 omega. According to the problem, assuming that S is a convex polygon, 0 < 3 omega < 4 omega < 180^circ, so 3 omega and 4 omega are supplementary angles: their sum is 180^circ, omega = frac{180^circ}{7}, thus the number of sides of S is 7."},{"problem":"## Condition of the problemFind the derivative.y=frac{1+8 operatorname{ch}^{2} x cdot ln (operatorname{ch} x)}{2 operatorname{ch}^{2} x}","solution":"## Solutionbegin{aligned}& y^{prime}=left(frac{1+8 cosh^{2} x cdot ln (cosh x)}{2 cosh^{2} x}right)^{prime}=left(frac{1}{2 cosh^{2} x}+4 ln (cosh x)right)^{prime}= & =-2 cdot frac{1}{2 cosh^{3} x} cdot sinh x+4 cdot frac{1}{cosh x} cdot sinh x=-frac{sinh x}{cosh^{3} x}+frac{4 sinh x}{cosh x}= & =frac{4 sinh x cdot cosh^{2} x-sinh x}{cosh^{3} x}=frac{sinh x cdotleft(4 cosh^{2} x-1right)}{cosh^{3} x}end{aligned}## Problem Kuznetsov Differentiation 11-15"},{"problem":"(2010•Gaoyao City Mock Test) Given a+b=6 and ab=3, find a^2+b^2.","solution":"Since a+b=6, we have:(a+b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2 = 36,Given that ab=3, we substitute to get:a^2 + 2 times 3 + b^2 = 36,Solving this, we find:a^2 + b^2 = 36 - 6 = 30.Therefore, the answer should be boxed{30}."},{"problem":"FolkoroIn a certain state, the airline system is arranged in such a way that each city is connected by air routesto no more than three other cities, and from any city, you can reach any other city with no more than onetransfer.

Understanding the Problem:   Peter wants to assemble a large square using smaller squares such that no rectangle formed by the small squares has all four vertices of the same color. We need to determine the largest possible size of such a square.2. Valid Coloring for (4 times 4) Square:   The solution claims that the largest possible square is (4 times 4). Let's verify this by providing a valid coloring:   [   begin{array}{cccc}   1 & 1 & 0 & 0    1 & 0 & 1 & 0    0 & 1 & 0 & 1    0 & 0 & 1 & 1    end{array}   ]   Here, '1' represents black and '0' represents white. We need to check that no rectangle formed by these squares has all four vertices of the same color.3. Verification for (4 times 4) Square:   - Consider any rectangle formed by selecting two rows and two columns.   - For example, selecting rows 1 and 2, and columns 1 and 2, we get:     [     begin{array}{cc}     1 & 1      1 & 0      end{array}     ]     The vertices are not all the same color.   - Checking all possible rectangles, we find that no rectangle has all four vertices of the same color.4.

For any integer n geqslant 1, we denote V_{n} as the number of vertices that can be reached from v by passing through at most n edges, including v.What is the smallest possible value of V_{n}?","solution":"Solution to Exercise 7 For any integer n geqslant 0, we denote by E_{n} the set of vertices reached by passing through n edges of G or fewer, and F_{n} the set E_{n} backslash E_{n-1}, i.e., the set of vertices reached by passing through n edges of G at a minimum. Furthermore, we denote by a_{n} the number of edges (x, y) such that x, y in E_{n}, and b_{n} the number of edges (x, y) such that x in E_{n} and y notin E_{n}. Note that these are exactly the edges (x, y) such that x in F_{n} and y in F_{n+1}.By construction, we know that a_{n} is less than or equal to the sum of the in-degrees of the vertices in E_{n}, while a_{n}+b_{n} is equal to the sum of the out-degrees of the vertices in E_{n}. Therefore, we have a_{n}+b_{n} geqslant a_{n}+left|E_{n}right|, so b_{n} geqslantleft|E_{n}right|. The pigeonhole principle then indicates that at least one of the vertices in F_{n} has an out-degree of b_{n} /left|F_{n}right| or more, so left|F_{n+1}right| geqslant b_{n} /left|F_{n}right| geqslantleft|E_{n}right| /left|F_{n}right|.

We then prove by induction on n that left|E_{2 n}right| geqslant(n+1)^{2} and that left|E_{2 n+1}right| geqslant (n+1)(n+2). First, this is true for n=0.

Moreover, if v is the vertex (0,0), then mathrm{E}_{n} is the set of vertices (a, b) such that a leqslant n, which shows that left|E_{2 n}right|=sum_{k=0}^{n-1} 2(k+1)+ (n+1)=(n+1)^{2} and that left|E_{2 n+1}right|=left|E_{2 n}right|+(n+1)=(n+1)(n+2).Therefore, we can affirm that the smallest possible value of V_{n}=left|E_{n}right| is (n+2)^{2} / 4 if n is even, or (n+1)(n+3) / 4 if n is odd, i.e., leftlfloor(n+2)^{2} / 4rightrfloor in all cases.![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_06_04_dba72b67df798c080479g-08.jpg?height=347&width=1239&top_left_y=2065&top_left_x=454)"},{"problem":"Given that the graph of the function y=a^{x+2}-2 (where a>0 and a neq 1) always passes through a fixed point A (whose coordinates do not depend on a), find the coordinates of the fixed point A.","solution":"To solve this problem, we start by considering the basic properties of the exponential function y=a^x (with a>0 and a neq 1).

Consider the inequality of the system and represent the set of its solutions on the coordinate plane. To expand the absolute values, we need to find the sets of points where the expressions under the absolute values are zero. These are the lines x+y+5=0 and x-y+5=0. They divide the plane into 4 parts, and in each of these parts, the signs of the expressions under the absolute values are constant. To determine them, we can choose a point in each of the four parts and calculate the signs of the expressions at these points. Consider the region located below both lines. For example, the point (0 ;-10) lies in this region. By substitution, it is easy to verify that in this point the expression x-y+5 is positive, and x+y+5 is negative. Thus, the inequality takes the form -(x+y+5)+(x-y+5) leqslant 10, from which y geqslant-5. Taking into account the considered constraints, the region lying above the line y=-5 and below the lines x+y+5=0, x-y+5=0 is suitable.

Since the equation is invariant under the substitution of x with (-x) and/or y with (-y), the set of points defined by the equation of the system is symmetric with respect to both coordinate axes. Reflecting the obtained arc relative to both coordinate axes and the point (0 ; 0), we get the desired set.

In total, we get frac{6 cdot 3 + 3 cdot 4}{2}=15 intersection points (the division by 2 is necessary because the expression in the numerator counts each intersection point twice).![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_05_06_853fe0fb72821c0a3a48g-11.jpg?height=380&width=1068&top_left_y=2176&top_left_x=572)IX Olympiad in Probability Theory and Statistics for Schoolchildren.

Expressing Points in Terms of Vectors:   Let's denote the position vectors of points ( A, B, C ) as ( overrightarrow{A}, overrightarrow{B}, overrightarrow{C} ) respectively.

Proving Similarity ( triangle STR sim triangle ABC ):   To prove similarity, we need to show that the corresponding angles are equal or the sides are proportional. We can use the fact that the points ( R, S, T ) are defined by the same ratio ( 1 - k ) and the points ( M, N, P ) are defined by the ratio ( k ).

This implies -frac{pi}{2} < A-B < frac{pi}{2}. Since sin x is monotonically increasing on (-frac{pi}{2}, frac{pi}{2}) and we have sin(A-B) = sin B, it follows that A-B = B or A = 2B.

Identify the total number of squares: The figure is a 3x3 grid, so there are (9) squares in total.2.

The faces are labeled from A to L such that two faces of the dodecahedron are adjacent if and only if the corresponding regions on the first diagram are adjacent (the first diagram can be obtained by projecting the dodecahedron from a point \\"above\\" the A-labeled face onto the plane of the L-labeled face).Suppose A is red. Then B, C, D, E, and F cannot be red. If L is red, then G, H, I, J, and K cannot be red. If L is not red, then at most two of G, H, I, J, and K can be red. Therefore, the number of faces that are the same color as A, including A itself, is at most three. By the symmetries of the dodecahedron, this can be said about every face. Thus, each of the four colors appears on at most three faces; however, we have 12 faces in total, so each of the four colors must appear on exactly three faces.Write down the three colors that can meet at each vertex. Since faces of the same color do not share a vertex and there are three faces of each color, each color is written down at 5 cdot 3 = 15 vertices, and thus 20 - 15 = 5 vertices do not have any color written down. An edge connecting a blue and a green face must start from exactly one of the vertices where either the red or the yellow color is not present. This amounts to 2 cdot 5 = 10 vertices, but since each edge has two endpoints, there are exactly 5 edges where one face is blue and the other is green. Based on the work of Gábor Lippner (Fazekas M.

As a first step, we show that the vertices of the maximum area square must necessarily lie on the boundary of the triangle. If at least two vertices of the inscribed square are interior points of the triangle (Figure 1), then the triangle has a vertex from which, by magnifying the view, the image of a vertex falls on the perimeter. Repeating this, we can achieve that three vertices of the square lie on the boundary of the triangle, while the area of the square increases.In Figure 2, three vertices of the square lie on the sides of the triangle. With the notation of the figure, X Y | B C, and we can assume that P B leq P Y and C R geq R X. The line P S intersects B C at D and A C at E. Due to the assumption P B leq P Y, the area of the triangle P B D is not greater than that of the triangle P S Y. Therefore, the area of the triangle C D E is smaller than that of the triangle A B C. If we now enlarge the triangle C D E - together with the square - so that its area becomes unit, then the area of the square P Q R S will also increase.From the above, it follows that the maximum area square is placed in the triangle as shown in Figure 3, with one of its sides lying on the side of the triangle that does not have a vertex with an obtuse angle. With the notation of the figure, from the similarity of the triangles A S R and A B C, we have x: d=(x+d): B C, from which B C=frac{d(x+d)}{x}. Thus, the area of the triangle is frac{1}{2} cdot frac{d}{x} cdot(x+d)^{2}, which, using the arithmetic and geometric mean inequality, can be estimated as:frac{1}{2} cdot frac{d}{x}(d+x)^{2} geq frac{1}{2} cdot frac{d}{x} cdot(2 sqrt{d x})^{2}=2 d^{2}This means that 2 d^{2} will be the largest when it equals the area of the triangle, and this occurs when x=d. In this case, d^{2}=frac{1}{2}, and B C=x+d=sqrt{2}. Therefore, the largest square can be inscribed in unit area triangles that are not obtuse and have a base and height of sqrt{2}.Note.

Convert the Fractional Inequality into a Quadratic Inequality: Multiply both sides of the inequality by x^2 (noting that we must consider the sign of x since multiplying by a negative number reverses the inequality sign). However, since we're interested in the sign of the product, we simply look at the product x(x-1). This step avoids the division by zero issue and simplifies the inequality to:   [   x(x-1) lt 0   ]2. Solve the Quadratic Inequality: To find when the product x(x-1) is less than zero, we identify the roots of the equation x(x-1) = 0, which are x = 0 and x = 1. These roots divide the number line into intervals. We test each interval to see where the product is negative:   - For x  1, both x and (x-1) are positive, so their product is positive.   Therefore, the product x(x-1) is negative only in the interval (0, 1).3. Write the Solution Set: The solution set of the inequality frac{{x-1}}{x} lt 0 is the interval where the product x(x-1) is negative, which is (0, 1).Therefore, the solution set of the inequality is boxed{(0,1)}.Explanation: This step-by-step solution demonstrates how to convert a fractional inequality into a quadratic inequality to find the solution set directly.

However, this recurrence relation seems incorrect, considering the sequence should be geometric, given the term 3a_n - 3a_{n-1}. The correct approach is to express 2S_n - 2S_{n-1} = 2a_n, which leads to 2a_n = 3a_n - 3a_{n-1}, and thus:a_n = 3a_{n-1}.This means the sequence {a_n} has a common ratio of 3, implying it is a geometric sequence. When n=1, substituting into the sum formula gives us:2S_1 = 3a_1 - 3,which means a_1 = 3. Therefore, the general term formula for the sequence {a_n} is:a_n = 3 cdot 3^{n-1} = 3^n.(2) Now we have b_n = 2a_n - 3n = 2 cdot 3^n - 3n.

Let's denote the total number of games by n. The ticket revenue for the first game is 5 million yuan, and for each subsequent game, the ticket revenue increases by 100,000 yuan. Therefore, the total ticket revenue, S_n, can be expressed as the sum of an arithmetic sequence:[S_n = 500n + frac{n(n-1)}{2} times 100]Given that the total ticket revenue for the finals is exactly 45 million yuan, we can set up the equation:[500n + frac{n(n-1)}{2} times 100 = 4500]Simplifying this equation:[500n + 50n(n-1) = 4500][500n + 50n^2 - 50n = 4500][50n^2 + 450n - 4500 = 0]Dividing the entire equation by 50 to simplify:[n^2 + 9n - 90 = 0]Solving this quadratic equation for n, we find the roots to be n = 6 and n = -15. Since the number of games cannot be negative, we discard n = -15 and keep n = 6. This means the finals consist of 6 games in total.To achieve a total of 6 games, the first 5 games must result in a win ratio of either 3:2 or 2:3, with the leading team winning the 6th game to secure the championship. The probability of this happening can be calculated as follows:For a 3:2 win ratio after the first 5 games, the probability is:[P = binom{5}{3} left(frac{1}{2}right)^3 left(frac{1}{2}right)^2 left(frac{1}{2}right)]For a 2:3 win ratio after the first 5 games, the probability is the same due to symmetry:[P = binom{5}{2} left(frac{1}{2}right)^2 left(frac{1}{2}right)^3 left(frac{1}{2}right)]Adding these probabilities together:[P = binom{5}{3} left(frac{1}{2}right)^3 left(frac{1}{2}right)^2 left(frac{1}{2}right) + binom{5}{2} left(frac{1}{2}right)^2 left(frac{1}{2}right)^3 left(frac{1}{2}right)][P = frac{10}{32} + frac{10}{32} = frac{5}{16}]Therefore, the probability that the total ticket revenue for the finals is exactly 45 million yuan is boxed{frac{5}{16}}."},{"problem":"Three, (50 points) Find the smallest positive integer n, such that any n-element set A of positive integers contains 15 elements whose sum is divisible by 15.","solution":"Three, Solution: Let A have 28 elements, with 14 elements each congruent to 1 and 2 modulo 15.

Identify the problem constraints:   We need to find the smallest positive integer ( n ) such that the sum of its digits ( s(n) ) and the sum of the digits of ( n + 864 ) both equal 20.2. Analyze the digit sum properties:   Let ( n = overline{abc} ) where ( a, b, c ) are the digits of ( n ). Thus, ( s(n) = a + b + c = 20 ).3. Consider the addition ( n + 864 ):   When adding 864 to ( n ), we need to consider possible carries:   [   overline{abc} + 864 = overline{(a+8)(b+6)(c+4)}   ]   However, if there are carries, the digits will not simply be ( a+8, b+6, c+4 ). We need to account for the carries.4. Determine the maximum possible digit sum:   The maximum increase in the digit sum due to carries is 3 (one carry in each place: units, tens, hundreds). Therefore, the digit sum of ( n + 864 ) is at most:   [   (a + 8) pmod{10} + (b + 6) pmod{10} + (c + 4) pmod{10} + 3   ]   Since ( s(n + 864) = 20 ), we have:   [   20 - 3 = 17 le (a + 8) pmod{10} + (b + 6) pmod{10} + (c + 4) pmod{10}   ]5.

Check values for ( b ):   - ( b = 0, 1, 2, 3 ) are too small because ( a + b + c = 20 ).   - ( b = 9 ) requires ( (c + 4) pmod{10} = 9 ), so ( c = 5 ).7.

Initial Setup and Assumptions:   We are given a non-constant monic polynomial ( f(x) ) with integer coefficients and a natural number ( M ) such that for all ( n geq M ), ( f(n) ) divides ( f(2^n) - 2^{f(n)} ). We need to determine all such polynomials.2. Divisibility Condition:   Let ( p ) be a prime such that ( p mid f(n) ). Then, for all ( k geq 0 ),   [   p mid f(n + pk) implies p mid f(2^{n+pk}) - 2^{f(n+pk)}.   ]   This implies that ( p mid f(2^{n+k}) - 2^{f(n+k)} ).3. Fixing ( r ) and Choosing ( p ):   Fix ( r > N ) and choose ( p ) such that ( p mid f(2^r) ). Pick a large ( m ) such that ( m equiv r pmod{p-1} ). Then,   [   p mid f(2^m).   ]   Since ( p mid f(2^m) - 2^{f(m)} ), we conclude that ( p = 2 ).4. Power of 2 Condition:   For each ( r > N ), ( f(2^r) ) must be a power of 2. Suppose ( f(0) neq 0 ). Then,   [   f(2^r) equiv f(0) pmod{2^r}.   ]   This implies ( f(2^r) leq |f(0)| ) for all ( r > N ), which is a contradiction since ( f ) is not constant. Therefore, ( f(0) = 0 ).5. Form of ( f(x) ):   Write ( f(x) = x^d g(x) ) for some ( d > 0 ) and ( g in mathbb{Z}[x] ) with ( g(0) neq 0 ). Since ( g(2^r) ) is a power of 2 for all large ( r ), and ( g(0) neq 0 ), ( g ) must be a constant function. Thus, ( f(x) = x^d ).6. Checking ( f(x) = x^d ):   For all odd primes ( p ), substituting ( f(p) = p^d ) gives:   [   p^d mid 2^{p^d} - 2^{p^d} implies p mid 2^{p^d - d} - 1 implies p mid 2^{d-1} - 1.   ]   By taking ( p ) large enough, we conclude that ( 2^{d-1} = 1 ), hence ( d = 1 ).

Solution","solution":": b. A circle lies in a plane, so we consider planes cutting the ellipsoid. The intersection of any plane P with the ellipsoid is an ellipse (assuming it cuts the ellipsoid in more than one point). That is fairly obvious. Substitute the linear equation for the plane into the quadratic equation for the ellipsoid and we get a quadratic equation for the projection of the intersection onto one of the coordinate planes. This must be a conic and, since bounded, an ellipse. Projecting back onto P shows that the intersection is an ellipse. It is less obvious, but true, that parallel planes give similar ellipses. So to maximise the size we take the plane P through the centre of the ellipsoid. Suppose its intersection with the ellipsoid is a circle K. P cannot be normal to one of the semi-axes, because then its intersection is certainly an ellipse with unequal semi-axes. So P must meet the bc plane in a line. This line is a diameter of K. But it is also a diameter of an ellipse with semi-major axes b and c, so it has length at most 2b, so K has diameter is at most 2b. Similarly P meets the ab plane in a line, which has length at least 2b, so the diameter of K is at least 2b. So if K has radius b. It remains to show that some planes do intersect the ellipsoid in a circle. Consider a plane through the semi-major axis b of the ellipsoid. The intersection K clearly has one diameter 2b. Moreover, the ellipse K is symmetrical about this diameter, so it must be one of its two semi-major axes. If we start with the plane also containing the semi-major axis c of the ellipsoid, then K has another diameter perpendicular to the first and length 2c. This must be the other semi-major axis of K. As we rotate the plane through a right-angle, the length of this diameter increases continuously to 2a. So at some angle it must be 2b. But an ellipse with equal semi-major axes is a circle. 31st Putnam 1970 © John Scholes jscholes@kalva.demon.co.uk 25 Aug 2001"},{"problem":"10.

Using the Angle Bisector Theorem:   - The Angle Bisector Theorem states that the angle bisector of an angle in a triangle divides the opposite side into segments that are proportional to the adjacent sides. Therefore, we have:     [     frac{AD}{DC} = frac{AB}{BC}     ]4.

For n=0, this translates to x_{1}>2 x_{0}>x_{0}, which, with the given initial values, translates to 3>2>1. Now assume as the induction hypothesis that x_{n+1}>2 x_{n}>x_{n}+x_{n-1}+ldots+x_{0}.

Understanding the problem: We need to find the largest ( n ) such that there exists a non-degenerate convex ( n )-gon where each interior angle is an integer number of degrees and all angles are distinct.2. Sum of exterior angles: For any convex ( n )-gon, the sum of the exterior angles is always ( 360^circ ). Since the interior and exterior angles are supplementary, the sum of the interior angles is ( 180^circ(n-2) ).3. Distinct integer angles: Since each angle is distinct and an integer, the exterior angles must also be distinct integers that sum to ( 360^circ ).4. Sum of first ( n ) integers: To find the largest ( n ), we consider the sum of the first ( n ) distinct integers. The sum of the first ( n ) integers is given by:   [   frac{n(n+1)}{2}   ]   We need this sum to be as close to ( 360 ) as possible without exceeding it.5.

Note that any fixed number n in N can be decomposed into a sum of natural numbers in only a finite number of ways. 298Therefore, among these representations, there will be one (perhaps not unique) decomposition n=m_{1}+m_{2}+ldots+m_{k}, where m_{1} leqslant m_{2} leqslant ldots leqslant m_{k}, for which the product m_{1} m_{2} ldots m_{k} takes the maximum value f(n), and no number m_{i}(i=1,2, ldots, k) equals 4 (any four can be replaced by two twos from the beginning, without changing either the sum or the product of the numbers). Then each number m_{i} does not exceed 4, because if m_{k}>4, then the product of the numbers m_{1}, m_{2}, ldots, m_{k}-2,2 will be greater than before (since left(m_{k}-2right) 2 > m_{k}), while their sum remains n. For n=1, we have the only decomposition, so f(1)=1. Further, for n>1, no number m_{i} equals 1, because if m_{i}=1, then the product of the numbers m_{1}+m_{2}, m_{3}, ldots, m_{k} will be greater than before (since m_{1}+m_{2} > m_{1} m_{2}), while the sum equals n.

Let the circles with diameters A A_{1} and B B_{1} be denoted by k_{A} and k_{B}, respectively, and the sought circle by k. If k were to touch the arc A B from the outside, or if the arc A B were to touch k from the inside, then k would have to touch the arc A B at both points A and B, since k_{A} and k_{B} are inside the circle containing the arc A B. Under these conditions, k could only be the circle containing the arc A B itself. However, we do not consider the identity of two arcs as a touching condition.Therefore, k touches the arc A B from the inside, and the possible configurations for the mutual positions of k_{A}, k_{B}, and k are: 1. both k_{A} and k_{B} touch k from the inside, 2. both k_{A} and k_{B} touch k from the outside, 3. one touches from the inside and the other from the outside. Since the given circles are symmetric with respect to the angle bisector of angle A O B, in the first case, the center of k is on the angle bisector of angle A O B, and in the third case, the center of k is on the ray O A or O B, depending on whether k_{A} or k_{B} touches k from the inside.Suppose k touches k_{A} from the inside (Figure 1).![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_05_02_a1451649247b9ca7a3d7g-1.jpg?height=959&width=764&top_left_y=678&top_left_x=667)Figure 1Let the center of k be C, its radius x, the point of tangency between the arc A B and k be E_{1}, the point of tangency between k and k_{A} be E_{2}, and the center of k_{A} be A_{2}. Since O C = 3 - x, C A_{2} = x - 1, and O A_{2} = 2, we have O C + C A_{2} = O A_{2}. Therefore, the triangle O C A is degenerate, so C lies on the line O A.The statements made for the third case can be applied twice to the first case, so in the first case, the center of k can only be O.

It is a matter of agreement whether to consider these as solutions, since in this case, the points of tangency are the endpoints of the arcs mentioned in the problem.We still need to address the construction of the center of k in the second case. Increase the radius of k by one unit. The resulting circle passes through the centers A_{2} and B_{2} of the circles k_{A} and k_{B}, respectively, and through the point D on the angle bisector of angle A O B that is 4 units away from O (Figure 4).![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_05_02_a1451649247b9ca7a3d7g-3.jpg?height=892&width=897&top_left_y=424&top_left_x=598)Therefore, we need to construct the center of the circumcircle of triangle A_{2} B_{2} D.

If he gets within 1 meter of the whistle, he can already see it.What should he do? Also, give an estimate of how many steps it will take for him to find the whistle, if he was originally d meters away from it.","solution":"Let the corners of the field be denoted by A, B, C, D, with A being the corner from which the game leader starts. If the game leader cannot see the flag from A, they should head towards the opposite corner C. Continue moving straight along the A C line until the flag is seen or until they are told that the last step moved them further away from the flag. In the latter case, denote the starting point of the last step by P and the endpoint by Q. Return from Q to P, and from there, take a step perpendicular to the A C line. If this brings them closer to the flag, continue moving straight until they see it. Otherwise, move in the opposite direction along the line perpendicular to A C until they see the flag.![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_05_02_2b1d9e03cca6c116cb37g-1.jpg?height=513&width=689&top_left_y=470&top_left_x=707)If the game leader sees the flag while moving along the A C line, it is clear that they will take at most [d+1] steps. (As usual, [x] denotes the greatest integer not greater than x.) Otherwise, let q be the perpendicular bisector of the segment P Q, and p be the reflection of q over P. Since stepping into Q moved the game leader away from the flag, the flag is on the side of q that contains P. Since the last step into P did not move them further away from the flag, the flag is on the side of p that contains P, so it must be within the strip bounded by p and q. Denote the endpoint of the first step taken perpendicular to A C by R. If this brings the game leader closer to the flag, the flag is on the side of the A C line that contains R; otherwise, it is on the opposite side. In either case, by moving along the center of the strip, the game leader cannot pass by the flag without seeing it, since the boundaries of the strip are half a meter from the center line, and they can spot the flag from a meter away. If, for example, they step into S last and see the flag from there, then A S leq d+1, and A P + P S leq A S cdot sqrt{2}, which means the number of steps required is at most 4 more. (Two steps are needed to turn around from Q, and two more if they need to turn around from R.) Therefore, the game leader will find the flag in at most [sqrt{2}(d+1)] + 4 steps.Note. Consider the part of the circle centered at A with radius d that lies within the rectangle A B C D. Cut this part in half with the line A C, and let delta be the central angle corresponding to the larger part. If delta < 100, the game leader generally needs to take fewer steps with the above strategy compared to starting from A towards D and then continuing the search along a line perpendicular to A D. Specifically, if d = A C, our strategy requires 122 steps, while starting along A D requires 170 steps. Denote by L(T) the number of steps required for a given strategy when the game leader finds the flag at T, and let M(d) be the maximum of the L(T) values for all T such that A T = d. Let m(d) be the minimum of the M(d) values over all possible strategies. We have only determined the value of m(d) for d = A C, and determining the entire function m(d) is a very difficult task.If d is not too small, it is advantageous for the game leader to take a probing step in every direction and then head towards the flag based on the responses to these steps. The problem can also be examined on an infinitely large field. It is a very difficult question to determine whether there exists a number K and a strategy such that for any large d, [d + K] steps are sufficient to find the flag."},{"problem":"5 cdot 39 can prove that for any given positive integer n, every complex number of the form r + s i (r, s are integers) can be expressed as a polynomial in (-n+i), and the coefficients of the polynomial all belong to {0,1,2, cdots, n^{2}}.That is, the equationr+s i=a_{m}(-n+i)^{m}+a_{m-1}(-n+i)^{m-1}+cdots+a_{1}(-n+i)+a_{0}holds, where m is a uniquely determined non-negative integer, and a_{0}, a_{1}, cdots, a_{m} are a unique set of numbers chosen from {0,1, 2, cdots, n^{2}}, and a_{m} neq 0.We call this equation the expansion of r+s i with base -n+i, and write it briefly asr+s i=left(a_{m} a_{m-1} cdots a_{1} a_{0}right)_{-n+i} .It is known that only a finite number of integers k+0 i can be expanded ask=left(a_{3} a_{2} a_{1} a_{0}right)_{-3+i}, a_{3} neq 0 .Try to find the sum of all such k.","solution":"【Solution】 From the given, we havebegin{aligned}k & =a_{3}(-3+i)^{3}+a_{2}(-3+i)^{2}+a_{1}(-3+i)+a_{0} & =left(-18 a_{3}+8 a_{2}-3 a_{1}+a_{0}right)+left(26 a_{3}-6 a_{2}+a_{1}right) i,end{aligned}where a_{1}, a_{2}, a_{3} are chosen from {0,1,2, cdots, 9}.By comparing the imaginary parts on both sides, we getbegin{array}{l}26 a_{3}-6 a_{2}+a_{1}=0, a_{1}=2left(3 a_{2}-13 a_{3}right) .end{array}Therefore, a_{1} is an even number.If a_{1}=0, then 3 a_{2}-13 a_{3}=0.

The question is the same as asking how many ways there are to write 180 as the sum of three positive integers, if the order of the numbers does not matter.If the order did matter, the number of all possibilities would be binom{179}{2}, since if we write 180 ones next to each other, we need to choose two out of the 179 spaces between the ones to divide the 180 ones into three parts.For a+b+c=180, and a, b, c are distinct positive integers, then these three numbers have 3!=6 different orders. Therefore, denoting the number of different shaped, non-equilateral triangles by x, there are 6x such triangles if the order of the angles matters. For a+a+b=180, and a, b are distinct positive integers, then these three numbers have 3 different orders. Therefore, denoting the number of isosceles but not equilateral, different shaped triangles by y, there are 3y such triangles if the order of the angles matters. There is 1 equilateral triangle.Based on these:binom{179}{2}=frac{179 cdot 178}{2}=15931=6 x+3 y+1The number of isosceles but not equilateral triangles is 88, since the size of the angles at the base can be any integer from 1 to 89 except 60.

Since alpha is at most 60, the total number of triangles is:begin{aligned}& sum_{alpha=1}^{60}left(left[90-frac{alpha}{2}right]-alpharight)+1=left(sum_{alpha=1}^{60}left[90-frac{alpha}{2}right]right)-sum_{alpha=1}^{60} alpha+60= = & 2 cdot(89+88+ldots+60)-(1+2+ldots+60)+60=2 cdot frac{30 cdot 149}{2}-frac{61 cdot 60}{2}+60= = & 4470-1830+60=2700 .end{aligned}III. solution.

Since alpha is already determined from this, the number of gamma and thus the number of triangles isbegin{aligned}& sum_{beta=61}^{89}((180-(beta+1))-beta)+1=sum_{beta=61}^{89} 180-2 beta= = & (89-61+1) cdot 180-2 cdot frac{(89-61+1) cdot(89+61)}{2}=5220-4350=870 .end{aligned}This totals 1830+870=2700 possibilities, so there are this many triangles.Remark.

Let a_{i}, b_{i}, and c_{i} denote, respectively, the number of ways to break down the positive integer i into the sum of one, two, or three positive integers, where the order of the terms does not matter.Clearly, a_{i}=1 for all i.It is also true that b_{2 k}=b_{2 k+1}=k, since the smaller number is an integer between 1 and k in both cases.If a number greater than 3 is broken down into the sum of three positive integers: k=x+y+z, then k-3=(x-1)+(y-1)+(z-1), where the three terms are non-negative. Thus, we have obtained a decomposition of the number 3 less, which is either a one-term (if exactly two of x, y, and z are 1); or a two-term (if exactly one of the three numbers is 1); or a three-term (if all three numbers are greater than 1).Conversely: from a one-, two-, or three-term decomposition of the number k-3, we get a three-term decomposition of k.Based on the above, it is true that:c_{k}=a_{k-3}+b_{k-3}+c_{k-3}Let now k=6 n.

First, let's assume d=1. Then we can rearrange the equation to a(2 b - 1) = 3 b + 6. From this, it follows that 2 b - 1 divides 3 b + 6, and thus also divides 2(3 b + 6) - 3(2 b - 1) = 15. Since 2 b - 1 is a natural number, we have four possibilities. If 2 b - 1 = 1, then b = 1 and a = 9. If 2 b - 1 = 3, then b = 2 and a = 4, which is a contradiction since a and b are not coprime.

Here, the \\"objects\\" are the volunteers, and the \\"boxes\\" are the different places.Since each place must have at least one volunteer, we can first choose 3 volunteers out of 5 and distribute them into the 3 places, ensuring each place has at least one volunteer. This can be done in C_5^3 ways. For the remaining 2 volunteers, since all places now can have more volunteers, we can distribute them freely into the 3 places. This is equivalent to solving the problem of distributing 2 identical objects into 3 different boxes, which can be done in C_{2+3-1}^{3-1} = C_4^2 ways.Therefore, the total number of arrangements is the product of these two steps:C_5^3 times C_4^2 = 10 times 6 = 60However, this calculation does not consider the different distributions of the initial 3 volunteers among the 3 places, as they are distinguishable.

The correct approach to solve this problem is by using the Principle of Inclusion-Exclusion. First, we consider the total number of ways to distribute 5 volunteers into 3 places without any restrictions, which is 3^5. From this, we subtract the arrangements where one or more places have no volunteers. If one specific place has no volunteers, there are 2^5 ways to distribute the volunteers among the remaining two places. Since there are 3 places, we subtract 3 times 2^5.However, if we stop here, we have subtracted too much for the cases where two places have no volunteers, as these were subtracted twice. Since there are 3 ways to choose which place will have all the volunteers, we need to add back these cases, which is 3 times 1^5.Therefore, the correct total number of arrangements is:3^5 - 3 times 2^5 + 3 = 243 - 96 + 3 = 150So, the total number of arrangements such that each place has at least one volunteer is boxed{150}."},{"problem":"A6 Let x_{i}>1, for all i in{1,2,3, ldots, 2011}.

This ensures that the first ( 2k ) chips become red.   - Case 2: There is a half with more than ( k ) red chips.     - If one half has more than ( k ) red chips, we can join all the red chips into one contiguous block by moving chips one at a time from the half with fewer chips to the half with more chips.

Additionally, you will learn how to compute integrals over parts of cylindrical and spherical surfaces.Using the package SOLVER.CA, you can find the coordinates of the unit normal vector to the surface (compute partial derivatives and the length of the vector), compute the resulting repeated integrals, perform all numerical calculations, and verify the correctness of your results.## 13.1.

Compute the surface integraliint_{Sigma} f(x, y, z) d sigmawhere Sigma is a part of the surface described by the equation F(x, y, z)=0 and some inequalities.PLAN OF SOLUTION. The surface integral is reduced to a double integral by projecting Sigma onto the coordinate plane X O Y using the formulaiint_{Sigma} f(x, y, z) d sigma=iint_{D} f(x, y, z(x, y)) frac{d x d y}{|cos gamma|}where D is the projection of Sigma onto the plane X O Y, gamma is the angle between the normal to the surface Sigma and the O Z axis; z(x, y) is determined from the surface equation F(x, y, z)=0.NOTE. If the equation F(x, y, z)=0 does not uniquely define the function z=z(x, y), then project Sigma onto another coordinate plane or use curvilinear coordinates (you can also divide the surface into parts and use the additivity of the integral).1. The unit normal vectors vec{n}_{0}={cos alpha, cos beta, cos gamma} to the surface given by the equation F(x, y, z)=0 are determined by the formulavec{n}_{0}= pm frac{operatorname{grad} F}{|operatorname{grad} F|}2. The projection D of the surface Sigma onto the plane X O Y is found by eliminating z from the conditions defining Sigma.3. We find z=z(x, y) by solving the equation F(x, y, z)=0.4.

Let's break down the solution step by step.1. Identify Key Angles and Properties of the Rhombus:   - Given that (ABCD) is a rhombus, all sides are equal, i.e., (AB = BC = CD = DA).   - The diagonals of a rhombus bisect each other at right angles.   - Given (angle BAD = 60^circ), we know that (angle ABD = angle ADB = 60^circ) because the diagonals of a rhombus bisect the angles.2. Locate Points (E) and (F):   - Points (E) and (F) are on sides (AB) and (AD) respectively such that (angle ECF = angle ABD = 60^circ).3. Triangles and Congruence:   - Consider (triangle CDF) and (triangle CBP). Since (CD = CB) (sides of the rhombus) and (angle DCF = angle BCP = 60^circ), these triangles are congruent by SAS (Side-Angle-Side) criterion.   - Similarly, (triangle CDQ) and (triangle CBE) are congruent by the same reasoning.4. Isosceles Trapezium:   - From the congruence of triangles, we have (CF = CP) and (CE = CQ).   - Since (angle ECF = 60^circ), and (angle ABD = 60^circ), the quadrilateral (FPEQ) is an isosceles trapezium with (FP parallel EQ) and (FQ = PE).5. Proportionality:   - In an isosceles trapezium, the lengths of the parallel sides are equal. Thus, (EF = PQ).   - Since (AB = AD) and (BD) is a diagonal of the rhombus, we know that (BD) is twice the height of the rhombus from any vertex to the opposite side.6. Final Ratio:   - Given that (EF = PQ), we have (frac{PQ}{EF} = 1).   - Since (AB = AD) and (BD) is the diagonal, we have (frac{AB}{BD} = frac{1}{2}).However, the problem states that (frac{PQ}{EF} = frac{AB}{BD}). Given the properties of the rhombus and the isosceles trapezium, we conclude that:[frac{PQ}{EF} = 1 = frac{AB}{BD}]Thus, the given solution is correct.(blacksquare)The final answer is ( boxed{ frac{PQ}{EF} = frac{AB}{BD} } )"},{"problem":"Given the line l: x-y+4=0 and the circle C: begin{cases} x=1+2costheta  y=1+2sintheta end{cases}, the minimum distance from any point on C to l is (　　)A: sqrt{2}B: 2sqrt{2}C: 2sqrt{2}-2D: 2sqrt{5}","solution":"For the circle C: begin{cases} x=1+2costheta  y=1+2sintheta end{cases} (where theta is a parameter), it can be transformed into the equation (x-1)^2+(y-1)^2=4.Thus, the center of the circle C is at (1,1), and the radius r=2.Therefore, the distance d from the center of the circle C to the line is d=frac{4}{sqrt{2}}=2sqrt{2}.Therefore, the minimum distance from any point on circle C to the line l is 2sqrt{2}-2.Hence, the correct answer is boxed{C}.The circle C: begin{cases} x=1+2costheta  y=1+2sintheta end{cases} is converted into a Cartesian coordinate equation, obtaining the center of the circle C at (1,1), and the radius r=2.

Step 3: Considering a = a + bGiven that using a = a^2 didn't work, we look at another possibility where a from the first set matches a + b from the second set:[a = a + b]This simplifies to:[b = 0] Step 4: Finding the Value of aWith b = 0, the equation a^2 = a + b simplifies to a^2 = a. We already established that a cannot be 0 for the sets to contain distinct numbers. Thus, we are left with the solution where a = 1. However, considering the distinctiveness of the elements and the initial reasoning, we realize that a = 1 does not satisfy the original conditions provided by both sets. Re-evaluating our approach, we correct our earlier oversight: The solution a = 1 was indeed dismissed incorrectly. Instead, we should consider the implications of b = 0 more carefully, leading us to re-examine the possible values of a.Upon further reflection, we recognize a mistake in our process of deducing a's value. Given b = 0, we must reconsider the solution to a^2 = a + b without prematurely dismissing potential solutions. Our focus should be on the correct interpretation of a^2 = 1, which we initially overlooked. This equation gives us two possible values for a: a = 1 or a = -1. The correct approach is to identify that a must indeed satisfy a^2 = 1 under the constraint b = 0, leading us to the conclusion that a=-1 is the suitable value, as it aligns with the distinctiveness requirement of the elements in each set. Step 5: Calculating a^{2023} + b^{2024}Having corrected our approach and determined that a = -1 and b = 0, we can now calculate the desired expression:[a^{2023} + b^{2024} = (-1)^{2023} + 0^{2024} = -1 + 0 = -1] Final AnswerThus, the value of a^{2023} + b^{2024} is boxed{-1}."},{"problem":"1.

The equations of lines OA and OB are y=k_{1}x and y=k_{2}x respectively. Solving the tangent condition gives us (4x_{0}^{2}-3)k^{2}-8x_{0}y_{0}k+4y_{0}^{2}-3=0.

Reflect triangle P Q R symmetrically relative to line P R, and triangle T S R - relative to line T R (see Fig. 11.5a). From the equality (*) and the equality R Q=R S, it follows that the images of points Q and S are the same point O.Note that triangle T O P is equilateral. Moreover, O R=O P=O T.

This shows that a_{k}, a_{k+1}, ldots, a_{n}, these n-k+1 numbers are all greater than k. However, 1, 2, ldots, n only have n-k numbers greater than k, which leads to a contradiction.In summary, the lemma is proven.Now, let's return to the original problem.Assume there are exactly P_{n} good permutations of order n.It is easy to see that P_{1}=1, P_{2}=2.For n geq 3, according to the lemma, either a_{n}=n or a_{n-1}=n, a_{n}=n-1.(1) If a_{n}=n, then left(a_{1}, a_{2}, ldots, a_{n-1}right) is a good permutation of order n-1 of 1, 2, ldots, n-1; conversely, for each such good permutation of order n-1, we have (n-1)a_{n-1} leq (n-1)^2 < na_{n}, thus left(a_{1}, a_{2}, ldots, a_{n-1}, nright) is a good permutation of order n. Hence, there are exactly P_{n-1} such good permutations of order n.(2) If a_{n-1}=n, a_{n}=n-1. Then left(a_{1}, a_{2}, ldots, a_{n-2}right) is a good permutation of order n-2 of 1, 2, ldots, n-2; conversely, for each such good permutation of order n-2, we have (n-2)a_{n-2} leq (n-2)^2 < (n-1)a_{n-1} = na_{n}, thus left(a_{1}, a_{2}, ldots, a_{n-2}, n, n-1right) is a good permutation of order n.

Construct a potential solution:   Consider the set ( A ) formed by taking every fourth number starting from 1:   [   A = {1, 5, 9, 13, ldots, 2017}   ]   This set can be written as:   [   A = {4k + 1 mid k = 0, 1, 2, ldots, 504}   ]   The number of elements in this set is:   [   |A| = 505   ]3. Verify the construction:   For any two elements ( 4a + 1 ) and ( 4b + 1 ) in ( A ), the difference is:   [   (4a + 1) - (4b + 1) = 4(a - b)   ]   Since ( a ) and ( b ) are integers, ( 4(a - b) ) is always a multiple of 4.

The magnitude of this vector is:   [   sqrt{9^2 + 12^2} = sqrt{81 + 144} = sqrt{225} = 15   ]   Therefore, the unit vector in this direction is:   [   left(frac{9}{15}, frac{12}{15}right) = left(frac{3}{5}, frac{4}{5}right)   ]   Hence, Garfield's position at time (t) is:   [   left(7t cdot frac{3}{5}, 7t cdot frac{4}{5}right) = left(frac{21t}{5}, frac{28t}{5}right)   ]   Odie starts at ((25,0)) and moves towards ((9,12)) at a speed of (10) units per minute. The direction vector from ((25,0)) to ((9,12)) is ((9-25, 12-0) = (-16, 12)). The magnitude of this vector is:   [   sqrt{(-16)^2 + 12^2} = sqrt{256 + 144} = sqrt{400} = 20   ]   Therefore, the unit vector in this direction is:   [   left(frac{-16}{20}, frac{12}{20}right) = left(-frac{4}{5}, frac{3}{5}right)   ]   Hence, Odie's position at time (t) is:   [   left(25 + 10t cdot -frac{4}{5}, 10t cdot frac{3}{5}right) = left(25 - 8t, 6tright)   ]2. Calculate the distance between Garfield and Odie as a function of time (t):   The distance (d(t)) between Garfield and Odie at time (t) is given by the distance formula:   [   d(t) = sqrt{left(frac{21t}{5} - (25 - 8t)right)^2 + left(frac{28t}{5} - 6tright)^2}   ]   Simplify the expressions inside the square root:   [   frac{21t}{5} - 25 + 8t = frac{21t + 40t - 125}{5} = frac{61t - 125}{5}   ]   [   frac{28t}{5} - 6t = frac{28t - 30t}{5} = frac{-2t}{5}   ]   Therefore,   [   d(t) = sqrt{left(frac{61t - 125}{5}right)^2 + left(frac{-2t}{5}right)^2}   ]   [   d(t) = sqrt{frac{(61t - 125)^2 + 4t^2}{25}}   ]   [   d(t) = frac{sqrt{(61t - 125)^2 + 4t^2}}{5}   ]3. Minimize the distance function (d(t)):   To find the minimum distance, we need to minimize the function inside the square root:   [   f(t) = (61t - 125)^2 + 4t^2   ]   Take the derivative of (f(t)) with respect to (t) and set it to zero:   [   f'(t) = 2(61t - 125) cdot 61 + 8t = 0   ]   [   2 cdot 61 (61t - 125) + 8t = 0   ]   [   122(61t - 125) + 8t = 0   ]   [   7442t - 15250 + 8t = 0   ]   [   7450t = 15250   ]   [   t = frac{15250}{7450} = frac{305}{149}   ]4. Calculate the minimum distance:   Substitute (t = frac{305}{149}) back into the distance formula:   [   dleft(frac{305}{149}right) = frac{sqrt{(61 cdot frac{305}{149} - 125)^2 + 4 left(frac{305}{149}right)^2}}{5}   ]   Simplify the expression inside the square root:   [   61 cdot frac{305}{149} = frac{18605}{149}   ]   [   61 cdot frac{305}{149} - 125 = frac{18605 - 18625}{149} = frac{-20}{149}   ]   [   left(frac{-20}{149}right)^2 = frac{400}{22201}   ]   [   4 left(frac{305}{149}right)^2 = 4 cdot frac{93025}{22201} = frac{372100}{22201}   ]   [   (61t - 125)^2 + 4t^2 = frac{400 + 372100}{22201} = frac{372500}{22201}   ]   [   dleft(frac{305}{149}right) = frac{sqrt{frac{372500}{22201}}}{5} = frac{sqrt{372500}}{5 cdot sqrt{22201}} = frac{610}{5 cdot 149} = frac{10}{sqrt{149}}   ]   Therefore, the minimum distance is:   [   frac{10}{sqrt{149}}   ]   The minimum distance can be written as (frac{m}{sqrt{n}}) where (m = 10) and (n = 149).

Counting the Faces:   - Each cylinder has 12 sides, and each side intersects with the other two cylinders.   - We need to show that each of the 12 sides of the cylinders contains at least one face of the polyhedron.5. Intersection of Cylinders:   - Consider the intersection of the polyhedron with a plane perpendicular to one of the cylinders. This intersection is contained in the polyhedron's surface.   - Each of the 12 sides of the cylinders contributes at least one face to the polyhedron.6.

Express ( S ) in Terms of Differences:   Consider the sum ( S = sum_{i < j} |a_i - a_j| ). Since ( a_{s_1} le a_{s_2} le ldots le a_{s_n} ), we can write:   [   S = sum_{i < j} (a_{s_j} - a_{s_i})   ]3.

Then, by letting x=y=0, we get that either f(f(0)) or f(-f(0)) is zero. The former gives a contradiction by plugging in x=f(0), y=0 into the original equation. Thus, f(-f(0))=0.Now plugging in x=0, y=-f(0) gives that f(2 f(0))=f(0). Finally, we note that by symmetry of the left hand side of the functional equation, f(x-f(y)) f(f(x)-y)=f(y-f(x)) f(f(y)-x), and letting y=0 and x=2 f(0) we get f(f(0)) f(f(0))=f(-f(0)) f(-f(0))=0, giving and so f(f(0)=0, again a contradiction. Therefore, f(0)=0.Setting y=0 yields x f(x)=f(x) f(f(x)), so if f(x) neq 0, then f(f(x))=x. On the other hand, setting y=f(x) yields (x-f(x))(f(x)-f(f(x))=f(x-f(f(x))) f(0), so in fact f(f(x))=f(x) rightarrow f(x)=x. Thus, for all x, f(x)=0 or f(x)=x.Clearly, f equiv 0 satisfies the original equation, so suppose there exists a non-zero x with f(x)=x. Then, for all y neq x, if f(y) neq 0, the original equation yields x(x-y)=x f(x-y). Thus, f(x-y)=x-y. Similarly, if f(y)=y, we find (x-y)^{2}=f(x-y)^{2}, so f(x-y)=x-y.

Consider the colorings of a 5 times 5 table described in the problem (i.e., such that in each column and each row exactly one cell is colored).For convenience, let's introduce some notations. The top-left corner cell of the 5 times 5 table will be called A, and the bottom-right corner cell will be called B. Suppose that among the colorings of the first table, exactly a have the cell A colored, and exactly b have the cell B colored. Clearly, a=b due to symmetry.Notice that the number of colorings of the second table is equal to the number of colorings of the first table where the cell A is not colored. The number of colorings of the third table is equal to the number of colorings of the first table where neither A nor B is colored. To find this, we subtract from 120 the number of colorings of the first table where A or B is colored. To count the number of such colorings, we add a and b, and then subtract what has been counted twice - the ways where both A and B are colored.All colorings of the first table can be divided into two types: those in which the cell A is colored, and those in which it is not. This leads to the equation 120=a+96, i.e., a=24. Then b=24 as well.The number of colorings where both A and B are colored is the same as the number of ways to color the central 3 times 3 square. It is easy to see that there are exactly 3!=6 such ways (to choose the colored cell in its top row, there are 3 ways, in the middle row - 2 ways, and in the bottom row - 1 way).Thus, the answer to the problem is the number 120-(24+24-6)=78.## 7th grade"},{"problem":"The parabola y^2=2px (p>0) has a focus at F.

If n=1, then x_{1} and x_{2} must be integers. Now let n>1.Due to the condition for m=1, either x_{1} or x_{2 n} must be an integer.Since x_{1}+cdots+x_{n} or x_{n+1}+cdots+x_{2 n} is an integer, and their sum is also an integer, we see that both of these numbers must be integers.Furthermore, x_{1}+cdots+x_{n-1} or x_{n+2}+cdots+x_{2 n} must be an integer. If x_{1}+cdots+x_{n-1} is an integer, since x_{1}+cdots+x_{n} is an integer, we conclude that x_{n} is an integer. Similarly, if x_{n+2}+cdots+x_{2 n} is an integer, we see that x_{n+1} must be an integer. Therefore, either x_{n} or x_{n+1} must be an integer.This shows that at least two terms of a good sequence must be integers.Now we prove that for every natural number n, there exists a good sequence of real numbers with exactly two integers.1.

If n is even, we define the sequence x_{1}=x_{n}=1 and x_{k}=frac{1}{2} for all other k in{1, ldots, 2 n}. For m<n.

Triangles with two angles equal to 60^{circ}: In a triangle, the sum of all angles is 180^{circ}. If two angles are each 60^{circ}, then the third angle must also be 60^{circ} to satisfy the angle sum property (60^{circ} + 60^{circ} + 60^{circ} = 180^{circ}). Therefore, such triangles are equilateral.2. Isosceles triangles with one angle equal to 60^{circ}: In an isosceles triangle, at least two sides are equal, and the angles opposite these sides are also equal. If one of the angles is 60^{circ} and the triangle is isosceles, it could potentially be an equilateral triangle if the other two angles are also 60^{circ}. However, not all isosceles triangles with one angle of 60^{circ} are equilateral, as the other two angles could be different from 60^{circ}. Thus, this statement is not universally true for identifying equilateral triangles.3. Triangles with all angles equal: If all angles in a triangle are equal, then each angle must be 60^{circ} because the sum of angles in a triangle is 180^{circ}. Therefore, such triangles are equilateral.4. Triangles with all sides equal: A triangle with all sides equal is, by definition, an equilateral triangle. The equal sides imply equal angles, and thus each angle in such a triangle is 60^{circ}.Given the analysis:- Triangles with two angles equal to 60^{circ} are equilateral.- Not all isosceles triangles with one angle equal to 60^{circ} are equilateral, so this condition alone does not guarantee an equilateral triangle.- Triangles with all angles equal are equilateral.- Triangles with all sides equal are equilateral.Therefore, the correct answer, considering the clarification on isosceles triangles, should focus on conditions that unequivocally define equilateral triangles: ① triangles with two angles of 60^{circ}, ③ triangles with all angles equal, and ④ triangles with all sides equal.However, based on the provided solution that considers all options (①②③④) as equilateral under their respective conditions, the answer is:boxed{D}"},{"problem":"Example 4 Find all positive integers a, b such that(a, b)+9[a, b]+9(a+b)=7 a b .","solution":"Let (a, b)=d, set a=d x, b=d y, then (x, y)=1 (by property 11), [a, b]=d x y (by property 8), thus substituting into (1) we getbegin{array}{c}1+9 x y+9(x+y)=7 d x y 7 d=9+9left(frac{1}{x}+frac{1}{y}right)+frac{1}{x y}end{array}Therefore,9<7 d leqslant 9+9left(frac{1}{1}+frac{1}{1}right)+frac{1}{1 times 1}=28Hence,2 leqslant d leqslant 4When d=2, from (2) we get5 x y-9(x+y)=1Multiplying both sides by 5 and factoring the left side, we get(5 x-9)(5 y-9)=86=2 times 43Thus, (5 x-9,5 y-9)=(1,86), (86,1), (2,43), (43,2).

Understanding the Problem:   We are given a (5 times 5) table where each cell contains a number from 1 to 5, and each number appears exactly once in every row and every column. A number is considered \\"good positioned\\" if:   - In its row, all numbers to its left are either all smaller or all larger, and all numbers to its right are the opposite.   - In its column, all numbers above it are either all smaller or all larger, and all numbers below it are the opposite.2. Constructing a Table with Good Positioned Numbers:   We need to construct a table where the maximum number of good positioned numbers is achieved. Consider the following table:   [   begin{array}{ccccc}   1 & 4 & 2 & 3 & 5    3 & 5 & 1 & 4 & 2    2 & 1 & 3 & 5 & 4    4 & 2 & 5 & 1 & 3    5 & 3 & 4 & 2 & 1    end{array}   ]   In this table, the numbers 1 and 5 in the corners and the number 3 in the center are all good positioned.3. Verifying the Good Positioned Numbers:   - Corners (1 and 5):     - For 1 in the first row and first column, all numbers to its right and below are larger.     - For 5 in the first row and fifth column, all numbers to its left and below are smaller.     - For 1 in the fifth row and fifth column, all numbers to its left and above are larger.     - For 5 in the fifth row and first column, all numbers to its right and above are smaller.   - Center (3):     - For 3 in the third row and third column, all numbers to its left and above are smaller, and all numbers to its right and below are larger.4. Proving the Maximum Number of Good Positioned Numbers:   - A number (k) can only be good if it is in either the (k)-th or ((6-k))-th column, and the (k)-th or ((6-k))-th row, because it needs (k-1) numbers above or below it, and (k-1) to the left or right.   - This means that only the following numbers can be good:     - The 1 in the first or fifth column.     - The 2 in the second or fourth column.     - The 3 in the third column.     - The 4 in the second or fourth column.     - The 5 in the first or fifth column.   - We pair these possibilities:     - The 1 in the first column and the 2 in the second column.     - The 1 in the fifth column and the 2 in the fourth column.     - The 3 in the third column.     - The 4 in the second column and the 5 in the first column.     - The 4 in the fourth column and the 5 in the fifth column.   - Only one number in each pair can be good. For example, if the 2 in the second column is good, it must be in the second or fourth row and have a 1 to its left, which means the 1 in the first column cannot be in the first or fifth row, so it cannot be good.5. Conclusion:   - By applying similar arguments for the other pairs, we see that only one in each pair can be good.   - Therefore, the maximum number of good positioned numbers is 5, which can be achieved as shown in the constructed table.The final answer is ( boxed{ 5 } )."},{"problem":"Given f(x) = begin{cases} x^{2}-2x, & xgeq 0  g(x), & x<0 end{cases} is an odd function, then g(x) = ______.","solution":"Since it is known that f(x) = begin{cases} x^{2}-2x, & xgeq 0  g(x), & x0, we have f(-x) = (-x)^2 - 2(-x) = x^2 + 2x = -f(x),Therefore, f(x) = -x^2 - 2x,Thus, g(x) = -x^2 - 2x,So, the answer is -x^2 - 2x (for x<0).By utilizing the properties of the odd and even functions, we can find the expression for f(x) when x<0, and thus obtain the expression for g(x).This question mainly examines the application of the properties of odd and even functions in finding the expression of a function, and it is a basic question.boxed{-x^2 - 2x}"},{"problem":"Example 3.

We set frac{y - 4}{x - 2} = k, so the equation becomes kx - y - 2k + 4 = 0.For this line to be tangent to the circle, the distance from the center of the circle (1, 1) to the line must be equal to the radius of the circle. The distance from a point (x_0, y_0) to a line Ax + By + C = 0 is given by the formula frac{|Ax_0 + By_0 + C|}{sqrt{A^2 + B^2}}. Substituting the values for our line and circle center, we get:frac{|k - 1 - 2k + 4|}{sqrt{k^2 + 1}} = 1.Solving for k, we first square both sides to remove the square root:(k - 1 - 2k + 4)^2 = (k^2 + 1).Simplifying and solving the resulting quadratic equation, we find the possible values of k. However, since we are only interested in the minimum value of frac{y - 4}{x - 2}, we will examine the distance formula closely:frac{|-k + 3|}{sqrt{k^2 + 1}} = 1.To find the minimum k, we minimize -k + 3 (since we are looking for the minimum of this value over the positive radius). So, we want the smallest k such that |-k + 3| = sqrt{k^2 + 1}. Since k is in a denominator and we want to minimize frac{y - 4}{x - 2}, we want the largest negative k (which will give the smallest positive value when in the denominator). From the distance formula, we see that k must be negative because the absolute value function and the square root will both yield positive results, and have to balance each other out.

Palmer rolls one of his normal dice and James rolls his peculiar die. If they tie, they roll again. Otherwise the person with the larger roll is the winner. What is the maximum probability that James wins? Give one example of a peculiar die that attains this maximum probability.","solution":"1. Understanding the Problem:   Palmer's die is a standard six-sided die with faces numbered 1 through 6. James's die has 21 dots distributed across its six faces, but not necessarily in the standard configuration. Both dice are fair, meaning each face has an equal probability of being rolled. The goal is to determine the maximum probability that James wins when both dice are rolled, and to provide an example of a configuration of James's die that achieves this maximum probability.2. Initial Considerations:   - James's die should not have more than 7 dots on any face, as rolling a 7 guarantees a win.   - Let ( s_1, s_2, ldots, s_6 ) be the number of dots on the faces of James's die.   - Let ( n ) be the number of faces with 0 dots.   - The total number of dots is ( s_1 + s_2 + cdots + s_6 = 21 ).3. Probability of Winning on the First Roll:   - If James rolls ( x ) dots, the probability that he wins on the first roll is ( frac{x-1}{6} ) for ( 1 le x le 6 ).   - If ( x = 0 ), the probability of winning is ( frac{0}{6} = 0 ).4. Calculating the Probability:   - The probability that James wins on the first roll is:     [     frac{1}{6} left( frac{n}{6} + sum_{i=1}^{6} frac{s_i - 1}{6} right) = frac{1}{6} left( frac{s_1 + s_2 + cdots + s_6 - 6 + n}{6} right) = frac{1}{6} left( frac{21 - 6 + n}{6} right) = frac{15 + n}{36}     ]5. Probability of a Tie:   - The probability of a tie after James rolls ( x ) is ( frac{1}{6} ) for ( 1 le x le 6 ) and 0 if ( x = 0 ) or ( x = 7 ).   - Let ( m ) be the number of faces with 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6 dots.   - The probability of a tie is ( frac{1}{6} cdot frac{m}{6} = frac{m}{36} ).6. Total Probability of Winning:   - The probability that James wins on the ( k )-th roll (( k > 1 )) is:     [     left( frac{m}{36} right)^{k-1} left( frac{15 + n}{36} right)     ]   - Summing over all possible rolls, the total probability of winning is:     [     sum_{i=0}^{infty} left( frac{m}{36} right)^i left( frac{15 + n}{36} right) = frac{frac{15 + n}{36}}{1 - frac{m}{36}} = frac{15 + n}{36 - m}     ]7. Maximizing the Probability:   - We have ( m + n le 6 ).   - To maximize ( frac{15 + n}{36 - m} ), we choose ( m ) and ( n ) such that ( m + n = 6 ).   - If ( n = 3 ), the faces must be ( 0, 0, 0, 7, 7, 7 ), which is not possible since ( 7 ) dots on a face is not allowed.   - Thus, ( n < 3 ), so the possible pairs ((m, n)) are ((6, 0)), ((5, 1)), and ((4, 2)).8. Calculating Probabilities for Each Pair:   - For ((m, n) = (6, 0)):     [     frac{15 + 0}{36 - 6} = frac{15}{30} = frac{1}{2}     ]   - For ((m, n) = (5, 1)):     [     frac{15 + 1}{36 - 5} = frac{16}{31}     ]   - For ((m, n) = (4, 2)):     [     frac{15 + 2}{36 - 4} = frac{17}{32}     ]9. Conclusion:   - The maximum probability is achieved with ((m, n) = (4, 2)), yielding a probability of (frac{17}{32}).   - An example configuration of James's die that achieves this is (0, 0, 6, 6, 6, 3).The final answer is ( boxed{ frac{17}{32} } )."},{"problem":"5.

Thus, we have two cases:- The missing digits are 2 and 8. In this case, there are five possibilities for placing the 2, four possibilities for placing the 8, and a single possibility for placing each remaining 5.

Considering the derivative with respect to x: The derivative of y with respect to x is given by differentiating y=frac{m-2}{x} with respect to x. This yields:   [   frac{dy}{dx} = frac{d}{dx}left(frac{m-2}{x}right) = -(m-2)x^{-2}.   ]2. Analyzing the sign of the derivative: For y to increase as x increases, the derivative frac{dy}{dx} must be positive. However, since x^{-2} is always positive (because squaring any real number, except zero, results in a positive number), the sign of frac{dy}{dx} depends solely on the sign of -(m-2). Therefore, for frac{dy}{dx} to be positive, -(m-2) must be positive, which simplifies to:   [   -(m-2) > 0 Rightarrow m-2 < 0.   ]3. Concluding the range of m: From the inequality m-2 < 0, we deduce that:   [   m < 2.   ]Therefore, for the graph of the function y=frac{m-2}{x} to have the property that the value of y increases as the value of x increases in each quadrant, the range of m must be such that m < 2.

Claim: In a match between two teams (of any size), there exists a player, in some team, such that this player won the games he played against at least half of the members of the other team.

Proof of Claim:   - Assume for the sake of contradiction that such a player cannot exist.   - Let the two teams be ( A ) and ( B ) with sizes ( a ) and ( b ) respectively.   - By our assumption, each player in team ( A ) won against fewer than ( frac{b}{2} ) players in team ( B ), and each player in team ( B ) won against fewer than ( frac{a}{2} ) players in team ( A ).   - Therefore, the total number of games won by team ( A ) is less than ( a cdot frac{b}{2} ), and the total number of games won by team ( B ) is less than ( b cdot frac{a}{2} ).   - Summing these, the total number of games won is less than ( frac{a cdot b}{2} + frac{b cdot a}{2} = a cdot b ).   - However, since each game has exactly one winner, the total number of games won must be exactly ( a cdot b ), leading to a contradiction.   - Hence, there must exist a player in some team who won against at least half of the members of the other team.

Size of Group ( G ):   - Each time we selected a *BoB*, the size of the other team was reduced at least by half.   - Since initially the size was ( 1000 ), which is less than ( 2^{10} ), we cannot apply Process 1 more than ten times.   - Hence, ( |G| leq 10 ).   - If ( |G| < 10 ), we can add any other player from the same team to ( G ) to make the size exactly 10.Conclusion:[boxed{10}]"},{"problem":"The imaginary part of the complex number z= frac {4+3i}{1+2i} is (　　)A: iB: -iC: -1D: 1","solution":"Solution: z= frac {4+3i}{1+2i}= frac {(4+3i)(1-2i)}{(1+2i)(1-2i)}= frac {10-5i}{5}=2-i,  Thus, the imaginary part of the complex number z= frac {4+3i}{1+2i} is: -1.

The pm sign is to take care of all alternatives. In fact, we have a^{2}+b^{2} geqslant 0 in the first equation, so we know that a+b geqslant 0. Now, by difference of two squares, we can write a^{2}-b^{2} as (a-b)(a+b) in the second equation.

For any fixed ( y in mathbb{R}^+ ), the function [ g(x) := f(x + f(xy)) = f(x) f(y) + 1 - y ]is injective by Step 1.

Step 3: There exist constants ( a ) and ( b ) such that ( f(y) = a y + b ) for all ( y in mathbb{R}^+ ). Since ( f ) is monotone and bounded from below by 0, for each ( x_0 geqslant 0 ), there exists a right limit ( lim_{x searrow x_0} f(x) geqslant 0 ).

For each prime number in the table, there is a composite number that serves it. Since each composite number has no more than three distinct prime divisors, it serves no more than three prime numbers. Thus, if the table contains n composite numbers, then the number of primes does not exceed 3n. Therefore, the total number of numbers in the table does not exceed 4n. Then4n geqslant 75^{2} Longrightarrow n geqslant frac{75^{2}}{4}=1406 frac{1}{4} Longrightarrow n geqslant 1407 Longrightarrow 75^{2}-n leqslant 75^{2}-1407=4218Thus, the number of prime numbers in the table does not exceed 4218.Now let's show how 4218 prime numbers can be placed in the table. We will use the following algorithm for filling rows and columns.1) The first 54 positions are filled with different prime numbers p_{1}, p_{2}, ldots, p_{54}. These numbers must be new, that is, not used before in the table.2) In the next 18 cells, we place the numbers p_{1} p_{2} p_{3}, p_{4} p_{5} p_{6}, ldots, p_{52} p_{53} p_{54}.3) The last three positions are left unfilled.We apply this algorithm sequentially to the rows 1,2, ldots, 75, and then to the last three columns. Thus, we will place 75 cdot 54 + 3 cdot 54 = 4212 prime numbers. It remains to fill the cells of the 3 times 3 square in the lower right corner. We choose new prime numbers q_{1}, ldots, q_{6} and place them as follows:left(begin{array}{ccc}q_{1} q_{2} & q_{3} q_{4} & q_{5} q_{6} q_{1} & q_{3} & q_{5} q_{2} & q_{4} & q_{6}end{array}right)In the end, we will place 4218 different prime numbers."},{"problem":"Given that (x-2)^{5}=a_{0}+a_{1}(x+1)+a_{2}(x+1)^{2}+cdots +a_{5}(x+1)^{5}, find the value of a_{1}+a_{2}+cdots +a_{5}.","solution":"This problem involves the coefficients of binomial expansion.

If c is any real number, then substituting y=left(c-(f(x))^{2}right) into (1) shows that f takes on the value c. We still need to prove that different numbers are mapped to different values. Let y_{1} and y_{2} be two different numbers and x be arbitrary. According to (1),fleft(x^{2}+fleft(y_{1}right)right)=y_{1}+(f(x))^{2}andfleft(x^{2}+fleft(y_{2}right)right)=y_{2}+(f(x))^{2}If fleft(y_{1}right)=fleft(y_{2}right) were true, then the left side of both equations would be the same number. This, however, contradicts the fact that the right sides are different. Therefore, fleft(y_{1}right) neq fleft(y_{2}right), and the function is indeed bijective.Second, we will prove that the function is odd, meaning for every real number x, f(-x)=-f(x), and specifically, f(0)=0. Let x neq 0 and y be arbitrary. Write the identity (1) for the pairs x, y and -x, y:begin{aligned}& fleft(x^{2}+f(y)right)=y+(f(x))^{2} & fleft(x^{2}+f(y)right)=y+(f(-x))^{2}end{aligned}Since the left sides are the same, (f(x))^{2}=(f(-x))^{2}, which implies |f(x)|=|f(-x)|; on the other hand, because of the bijectivity of f, f(x) neq f(-x). From these, it follows that f(-x)=-f(x) neq 0. We see that f takes the value 0 only at 0, so f(0) can only be 0; thus, f is indeed odd.Now, substitute 0 for x in (1); we get that for any y, f(f(y))=y.We will also show that f is monotonically increasing, meaning if a leq b are two real numbers, then f(a) leq f(b). Let c be a number such that b=a+c^{2}. (Since a leq b, such a number exists.)

Let x be arbitrary. If f(x)<x, then f(f(x))<f(x), which is a contradiction. If f(x)>x, then f(f(x))>f(x), which is also a contradiction.

Therefore, if Lesh answers \\"cold\\" to the first 15 questions and \\"warm\\" to the 16th, Grisha will know for sure that the guessed number is one of 79, 69, 89 (78 cannot be, as the 5th step question \\"77\\" received a \\"cold\\" response). This explains the origin of the \\"imperfect\\" crosses in the figure. Suppose now that on a certain step, we hear the response \\"warm.\\" Then we know in which exact cross the guessed number is. For example, if this happens on the 5th step, we can guess the number in three more questions (\\"76\\", \\"67\\", \\"78\\"). If the number falls into an \\"imperfect\\" cross, we will manage with fewer questions.Suppose Grisha hears the response \\"warm\\" for the first time on the n-th question.

Indeed, then, after receiving \\"cold\\" responses to 18 questions, Grisha will not be able to determine which of the uncovered cells is guessed.Suppose that at most one uncovered cell remains. Then, out of the four corner cells, at least three are covered. But a corner cell can only be covered by an \\"imperfect\\" cross. Therefore, the total number of covered cells does not exceed 5 cdot 18 - 3 = 87.
