In many patients initially after starting minoxidil use there is an increased hair fall, we call that phenomenon \\"anagen induction\\". It usually settles down after 2-3 months and then you will get improvement. This hair loss is a good sign as increased fall is due to a lot of new hair formation which pushes the resting telogen hairs out.Please continue Tugain. Make sure that you are applying it on the scalp and not hair and use only 1 ml twice daily, not more than that.Hope this helped,Take care."},{"Patient":"I am having heavy hairfall which is not stopping at all.

If the infection is very severe, it could lead to the destruction of the hair follicles which could result in loss of hair in the affected area.Sometimes, it is temporary and the hair regrows in a couple of months.However, if there has been considerable scarring, the scar tissue will replace the hair follicles and hair may not grow back.Hope this helps you.Take care."},{"Patient":"I have had more than normal hair loss for ~5 months with an itchy scalp recently.

It inhibits the enzyme 5 alpha reductase.Finasteride by virtue of its inhibitory action on this enzyme prevents progression of hair loss in androgenetic alopecia. Treatment is life long and is US FDA approved.This enzyme catalyzes the conversion of testosterone to Dihydrotestosterone Or DHT; DHT is the main culprit that is responsible for thinning in androgenetic alopecia.Side effects like decreased libido may be reported in 1-2% of patients on oral finasteride; however these side effects are transient and subside on continued treatment with the drug.Apart from this there are no side effects with Finasteride.The other tablet contains Biotin, is basically a co-therapy and is not specific for androgenetic alopecia.

Thanks for writing to us at healthcaremagicYou seem to have scalp seborrheic dermatitis.Dandruff Or Seborrheic Dermatitis is a common cause of increased hair shedding. Your increased hair shedding is most likely due to underlying dandruff.Controlling dandruff effectively would control excessive hair fall too.Various antifungal agents (e.g ketoconazole, sertaconazole, ciclopirox olamine, piroctone olamine) are available either as shampoo or as overnight leave-on lotions, for dandruff.Nizoral shampoo contains ketoconazole. It is available OTC and is the most commonly used antidandruff shampoo. It may alone be sufficient in mild cases.In severe cases, along with the antidandruff shampoo, I usually ask my patients to use a topical steroid lotion (Mometasone furoate Or Clobetasole propionate lotion) once daily at night for a short period of 2 weeks Or I might switch them to an overnight leave-on antidandruff preparation.Seborrheic dermatitis is a steroid responsive condition, therefore, topical steroids are usually effective in this condition.A two weeks course of topical steroids brings about remarkable improvement, which can then be maintained with just an anti-dandruff shampoo, every alternate days.You may visit a dermatologist in your region. Your dermatologist may ask you to use one of the prescription antifungal shampoo e.g Ciclopirox olamine, Piroctone Olamine based shampoo Or choose to prescribe an overnight leave-on antidandruff lotion.Your dermatologist might also choose to prescribe a topical steroid lotion for a short duration of 2-4 weeks.Regards"},{"Patient":"Hi, I have small frontal hairloss on my forehead.

Oral treatment is however to be cautiously used in females of child bearing age because it can cause harmful effects in the fetus.Treatment is long term and effects are usually noticeable after 6-8 months of regular use.Newer treatment options are Microneedling and Platelet Rich Plasma Therapy.The mechanism of these being stimulation of hair follicle by growth factor released from activated platelets.

Thanks for writing to us at healthcaremagicAfter going through the prescribed treatment, I am of the view that Androgenetic Alopecia is the likely reason for your hair fall and decreased hair density.Treatment of Androgenetic Alopecia produces good results if initiated early in the course before it is too late.Minoxidil and finasteride are US FDA approved treatments for Androgenetic Alopecia. Treatment is long term and usually produces noticeable improvement within 3 months of initiating.You have already been using Minoxidil and would suggest that you stick to it. Adgain capsules contains Biotin. Biotin would be an added advantage as it promotes hair growth. It also promotes utilization of proteins by hair.Response in androgenetic alopecia is slow and results may not be noticeable before 3-6 months of regular use.If this fails other treatment options that are useful for Androgenetic Alopecia are PRP (Platelet Rich Plasma) therapy and hair transplant.In PRP patients own blood is centrifuged under controlled conditions and the platelet rich plasma fraction is separated from the rest of it.

The doctor will assess the severity of your dandruff and judge whether other contributory factors like Telogen effluvium and Androgenetic alopecia, are involved or not.I would suggest you to use an OTC antidandruff shampoo e.g Nizoral, daily or every alternate days.For sever dandruff patients may also be started on topical steroid lotions for a short period of time.Topical steroids are usually rapidly effective in bring about remarkable improvement in the condition in 2 -3 weeks; the improvement can thereafter be maintained with antidandruff shampoos.Orally you may take a biotin supplement and an Iron supplement, once daily. These help in faster recover from hair loss specially if telogen effluvium is the responsible.Your doctor may also ask you to apply minoxidil if there is a component of androgentc alopecia.Regards"},{"Patient":"Dear Doctor, I am 32 years old. I am suffering from hair fall problem. Also i have dandruff with grey hair. Since my hair has become thin, almost the scalp is visible. Went to dermatologist and he prescribed biotin tablets for 2months (one table per day), Ketsal shampoo for dandruff and Regaine 5% solution for hair regrowth. Still i have dandruff problem and hair fall problem. Could you please suggest any other treatment for this. Also can i apply Caster oil / Olive oil before shampooing for hair growth? If possible can you please suggest me some veg diet to get healthy hair.","Doctor":"Hello. Thanks for writing to us at healthcaremagicDandruff Or Seborrheic Dermatitis is a common cause of increased hair shedding. Controlling dandruff effectively would control excessive hair fall too.You probably also have androgenetic alopecia, as can be judged from your prescription which contains, Minoxidil.The shampoo which you are using contains 2% ketoconazole, which is a common ingredient of antidandruff shampoos.However, in some cases a ketoconazole based antidandruff shampoo alone may not be totally effective specially if dandruff is excessive.In such cases there are various options available to more effectively control dandruff:-Seborrheic dermatitis is a steroid responsive dermatoses, therefore we have an option of using topical steroids lotionI usually ask my patients to use a topical steroid lotion (Mometasone furoate Or Clobetasol propionate lotion) once daily at night for a short period of 2 weeks-Another factor responsible for resistant dandruff is because the contact time of a shampoo is just 5-7 minutes Or even lesser (recommended is 10-15 minutes for ketoconazole based shampoo) and the active ingredient does'nt remain in contact with the scalp for a sufficient period of time.Therefore using an overnight leave-on antidandruff preparation/lotion would be more effective as compared to a shampoo.-Alternative shampoos can be tried and are usually more effective e.g a coal tar+salicyclic acid based shampoo is an alternative as are other antidandruff shampoos, containing ingredients for which a shorter contact time (3-4 minutes) is good enough like ciclopirox olamine, piroctone olamine, sertaconazole etc.Apart from Minoxidil, I would also like to add Oral Finasteride which is specific for androgenetic alopecia because it reverses and prevents follicular miniaturization.A biotin supplement may also be added. Biotin would be an added advantage as it promotes hair growth. It also promotes utilization of proteins by hair.Oiling before shampoo is fine. Its only purpose is to condition the hair. As such it wont help with your hair fall.I would suggest that you seek another appointment with your dermatologist. Your dermatologist would tell you more about these in detail and advice accordingly.Regards"},{"Patient":"Hi..I am 24yrs age old iam using Tugain solution,miniscalp gel,anaphase shampoo from past 1year as i have hair fall and hair thinning first 6 months i saw new hair growth but now again iam lossing hair and now my scalp also is visible,,so please suggest me what do i need to do ?","Doctor":"Hi,You seem to have androgenetic alopecia.

While there are no quick fix solutions to hair loss problem but it is important to find out and address the underling cause of hair fall to achieve desirable results.The common causes in a female being either Telogen effluvium or Female pattern Androgenetic Alopecia.Telogen effluvium in turn can be due to multiple causes; common ones being Deficient Iron stores, Thyroid (hypothyroid or hyperhyroid), Drugs (antiepileptics like valproate), Post-delivery (post-partum hair loss), Post stress (either medical illness like e.g dengue malaria jaundice etc Or Severe Psychological stress), Weight loss etcThe identification of underlying cause requires a detailed history, physical examination as lab tests like complete hemogram, thyroid, serum ferritin levels etc.In my practice I usually ask my patients of Chronic Telogen Effluvium to take an oral Iron Supplement along with a Biotin supplement for 4-6 months together.Female Pattern Androgenetic Alopecia (FAGA), which is also a very common cause of hair fall and thinning, but can be difficult to distinguish from Telogen Effluvium in females, specially early in the course.Later on, Androgenetic alopecia presents as widened part-width and decreased hair density from the vertex and crown of the scalp.The hair loss in FAGA is gradual over the years and although the scalp remains covered, the hair volume is reduced.Androgenetic alopecia (FAGA) in females is commonly managed with 2% minoxidil solution is a non-specific hair growth promoter can be applied at the scalp skin in this type of hair loss, twice daily with a dropper (1ml twice daily).Minoxidil is a hair growth promoter and helps in rapid transition of hair follicle from resting phase to growth phase (Anagen).These are all prescription medicines and therefore I would suggest that you visit a dermatologist in your region for a proper assessment and treatment accordingly.The treatment need to be taken for at least 4-6 months at a stretch. The results are slow, don't expect immediate results.It is advisable to continue treatment for a good 1-2 months to judge whether they are going to be effective Or not.Regards"},{"Patient":"about hair falldear sir,i am from india a stidying out side the home town and living as paing guest,i have excessive hair fall problem since 2 year.i cant prevent my hair from dendruff even washing daily with shampoo,so please consult me in this situation.","Doctor":"Hello.

Even mild dandruff can lead to increased shedding but it is usually not bothersome or excessive and individuals usually do not notice a decrease in hair density.Other factors like androgenetic alopecia can be a coexistent with dandruff and may be contributing to excessive hair fall and decreased hair density.For dandruff you may try a prescription antifungal/antidandruff shampoo e.g 2% ketoconazole shampoo, every alternate days for 2-4 weeks.Along with antidandruff shampoo, 2 weeks application of a topical steroids lotion may prove to be effective in providing better control.Thereafter, antidandruff shampoo may be continued once or twice weekly to maintain the improvement.I would suggest that you visit a nearby dermatologist for a prescription.

Thanks for writing to us at healthcaremagicAndrogenetic alopecia is the likely reason for his hair fall and decreased hair density.I would suggest that he consults dermatologist for a prescription because treatment of androgenetic alopecia produces good results if initiated early in the course before it is too late.Minoxidil and finasteride are US FDA approved treatments for androgenetic alopecia. Treatment is long term and usually produces noticeable improvement within 3 months of initiating.Other treatment option for androgenetic alopecia is PRP (Platelet Rich Plasma) therapy and hair transplant.In PRP patients own blood is centrifuged under controlled conditions and the platelet rich plasma fraction is separated from the rest of it. This platelet rich fraction is then injected into the are affected by hair loss. The principle of this therapy is that human platelets are rich in growth factors which promote hair growth and even reverse hair loss.Sessions of PRP can be repeated every 2-3 months for a total of 3-4 sessions.I would suggest him to consult a dermatologist in his region regarding the best form of therapy for his kind of hair loss.Regards"},{"Patient":"Hi,I am 31 years old female and have hair loss and receding hair line.

Thanks for writng to us at healthcaremagicJudging from the medicines that you have been prescribed by your doctor, I think you most likely have androgenetic alopecia, as the reason behind your hair fall.You have been prescribed topical minoxidil by your doctor. This is an approved medication for this type of hair loss. Most patients do notice improvements once the treatment is started, however,the response may vary from person to person. Treatment may take 2-3 months to produce noticeable improvement. Therefore, you have to be patient and follow up with your doctor regularly. However, if I was the treating doctor I would have also started you on oral Finasteride along with minoxidil. While minoxidil is a non-specific hair growth promoter, Finasteride is an inhibitor of 5 alpha reductase which is the main enzyme responsible for follicular miniaturization and hair fall. Finasteride acts by inhibiting this particular enzyme and is therefore specific for this type of hair loss.The goal of treatment is to arrest the progression of androgenetic alopecia. Both Minoxidil and Finasteride are FDA approved for this type of hair loss.Besides, there are other treatment modalities that have become available for androgenetic alopecia e.g PRP.Platelet rich plasma OR PRP, is an autologous concentration of human platelets in a small volume of plasma has a higher platelet concentration (4-7 times) above the baseline. It is obtained from the patient's own blood after processing in an automated centrifuge and it is injected subcutaneously into the area of alopecia.The beneficial effects of PRP in Androgenetic Alopecia can be attributed to various platelet-derived growth factors causing improvement in the function of hair follicle and promotion of hair growth.Advantages of PRP: It is safe, cheap, and non-allergic and it appears to be a useful adjuvant in the management of AGA.To get satisfactory results, 2 - 3 treatments should be performed at intervals of 3-4 months. You need to use Minoxidil and finasteride along with PRP to maintain the improvement.I would suggest that you seek an appointment with your dermatologist and inquire in detail about the various modalities.Regards"},{"Patient":"hello everyone i am having some rapid hair loss just after coming to new home i suddenly feel hairs less volume and day by day they r going lesses i am worried im 25 n half male how to control this and what kind of baldness it is? should i shampo daily or oiling?","Doctor":"HiThank you for asking HCMI have gone through your query.You should get your hemoglobin level and TSH which will rule out anemia and thyroid disorder respectively which can be a cause of it.If you are getting hair fall on frontal side it is most likely male pattern hair loss.In such case minoxidil lotion helps.But it should be used for at least 3 months to get some benefit.It should be continued also.You can take vitamins for hair like biotin.Avoid stress and take nutritious foods.But if you have scales like silvery appearance then it can be scalp psoriasis.In such case if mild coaltar shampoo application helps.Local corticosteroids like clobetasol will be needed if no improvement.It is better to get a dermatologist consultation to rule out the type of hair loss you have.Hope this may help you.Let me know if you have any further query."},{"Patient":"good afternoon doctor,  I have suffering from hair since 2 years. i have taken Dr. Batra's course for 6 months, the fall was stopped when i was using the treatment but again after a break of one month the hair fall started.

I would like to say few things about androgenetic alopecia..It is an inherited condition, caused by a genetically determined sensitivity to the effects of dihydrotestosterone, or DHT in some areas of the scalp. DHT is believed to shorten the growth, or anagen, phase of the hair cycle, from a usual duration of 3-6 years to just weeks or months. This causes miniaturisation of the follicles, and producing progressively fewer and finer anagen hairs. The production of DHT is regulated by an enzyme called 5-alpha reductase. Initially the hairloss occurs in frontal area on both sides, then occipital area is invoved and gradually the whole scalp may be bald.You consult dermatologist for firm diagnosis.I might treat my patients as below..- finesteride tab 1 mg daily- biotin 10 mg containing tab daily- application of minoxidil solution 10% twice a day- shampoo with ketoconazole contsining shampooThe above treatment is not prescription.

Thanks for writing here.The hair fall you are describing here is called Telogen effluvium.It is caused by sudden emotional or physioloigical stress. Fever you had 2 months back is the stress in your case.Hair cycle includes 3 phases: 1) Anagen : active growth phase of hair follicles.2) Catagen: end of the active growth of hair follicles3) Telogen: the resting pahse of hair follicles.In telogen effluvium there is accelerated shedding of hairs in telogen phase.Telogen effluvium is a reactive process and resolves spontaneously. The main part of treatment is Reassurance.You will get your hair back within 3-6 months though it is difficult to say the exact time.In my opinion you can take tablets containing biotin and zinc.

I purchased Next Choice at the store and took one pill yesterday as instructed at 10:00pm. I went to work and forgot to take the pill at 10:00am (12 hrs after I took the first one) so I ended up taking it around 12:00pm instead. Is there a chance that since I took the second pill two hrs late I can get pregnant?","Doctor":"Hi there, I have understood your concern. I will suggest you the best possible treatment options. As you might be aware that when emergency contraceptive pills are taken within 72 hours of unprotected sex act, it works to prevent pregnancy in most of the cases. As you have consumed the pills within 24 to 72 hours, you need not worry about the pregnancy.  Delay of 2  hours in taking the second pill will not cause failure to prevent the pregnancy.  You need to wait patiently for the withdrawal bleeding. Once you get withdrawal bleeding,  it will confirm that you are not pregnant. I hope this answer helps you . Thanks.

Therefore any treatment or procedures can never make you fairer than what you were at the time of birth. But most of the people will acquire more pigmentation as age increases, we call it facultative pigmentation. Lot of factors determine it, most important being sunlight, others include dust, pollution, smoking, less hydration, intrinsic ageing and free radical damage, stress etc.Treatments should be to bring your pigmented skin back to your normal skin tone and make the skin tone even all over the face. I would recommend you to use a face wash twice a day ideally a one containing glycolic acid as it helps in exfoliation and to even out the skin tone.The most important product will be a sunscreen. Half an hour before going out apply a sunscreen and reapply it every three to four hours. At night you may apply a lightening cream containing kojic acid over the face before going to sleep.You may consult a dermatologist practicing cosmetology for few sittings of chemical peels for faster improvement.Hope this helps.Take care."},{"Patient":"i have been diagnosed with acanthosis nigricans and i'm currently under medication with venusia cream and fluvitate cream and also desloratadine and monteleukast tablets.

I understand your frustration.You could continue venusia cream in the morning. After using flutivate cream for 3 weeks, use a cream containing .0.25% Tretinoin at bedtime on the neck. Do not use this on other areas like underarms and groins as it can irritate the delicate skin there.You could get retinol peels or yellow peels done by a dermatologist.You should try to lose weight as this is the major contributing factor for the darkness.

I am loosing hope. Please help.","Doctor":"Hello,Welcome to healthcare magic.Vitiligo is an autoimmune disorder in which our body attacks its own pigment forming cells.If you are having actively spreading vitiligo, we call it unstable disease. You will benefit from taking low dose steroids which are given only on weekends as pulses so as to minimize the side effects. Many people postpone treatment and resort to alternative herbal remedies because of the fear of side effects of steroids. However, this will lead to rapid spread of the disease and it will be too late to treat effectively. Low dose steroids given as pulses under supervision can stop the spread of disease and slowly cause repigmentation.There are other modalities like phototherapy,immunomodulator creams like tacrolimus and antioxidants which will also help.Please discuss with your dermatologist about these options. Do not neglect till it is too late. Earlier the treatment, better the results.Do not be frustrated as stress can worsen this disease.Be positive and motivated and I am sure you will be fine.Wishing you good health,Dr. Johny Chacko"},{"Patient":"hi........... this is sara...........i got a alergy on my my face.i approached dermotologist.......pimples all cured...... but i got a black spots on my face now i am using depiwhite cream, suggested by doctor.........how many days it will take for cuing.........then i have taken chemical peel of treatment also.........whether it is good or not","Doctor":"HIThank for asking to HCMI really appreciate your concern and from the history given here I could say that right just do nothing for the black spots that you have and wait for some time this would come around if it does not then you can try \\"Hydroquinone cream, take care and have a nice day."},{"Patient":"Hello, I get hyper pigmentation on my skin in form of red pink dots whenever I remove hair from arms or legs.

Also, would put you on solution containing 5%/10% minoxidil once a day and a hair serum containing peptides for hair growth at night.(Q sera etc).

The other component is due to external agents like environmental exposure, sunlight, use of any cosmetics etc and is amenable to treatment.You can get a series of chemical peels, which actually remove the upper dead layers of skin and stimulate regeneration of collagen and thus newer layers of skin. Many options are available in chemical peels depending on the requirement and skin type. (Glycolic peel, retinol peel, cocktail peel etc)Also, chemical peeling can be preceded by a simple procedure called microderamabrasion or commonly known as skin polishing to augment the results.Also, at home you can try using cream containing kojic acid, tetrahydrocurcumin, arbutin etc for several months (Melaglow cream) for additional benefit and maintenance.Always use broad spectrum sunscreen before going out in sun.Use a plain moisturiser like cetaphil DAM on daily basis for healthy and hydrated skin.Take plenty of fresh fruits and vegetables in your daily diet.Hope this will take care of your issue.Thank youDr Hardik Pitroda"},{"Patient":"hi, i am a 14 year old female., i have very dark red and purple mini spots in small areas on both of my upper thighs. they arent itchy, but are irritating and scaly. they are raised from the service of my skin,, and hurt immensly when touched. what is this??","Doctor":"Hi,You probably may be having follicultis.There may be erythematous papular eruptions.

It has tendency for recurrence and complications like pigmentation and scarring, thus mandates proper treatment at the earliest. Treatment usually depends on severity of of acne and for the accurate grading you need a proper examination by a dermatologist. Usually I advise proper course of oral antibiotics (Azithromycin etc) with or without oral isotretinoin for few months. Additionally, I advise use of a cream containing nadifloxacin/clindamycin twice day and  a gel containing benzoyl peroxide and adapalene for few months. Apart from home-based treatment, I also advise procedures like chemical peeling and laser and light therapy as you are having associated complication like pigmentation.Use good quality face wash and a moisturizer on regular basis.Avoid junk food as far as possible and include plenty of fresh fruits and vegetables in your diet.Hope this will take care of your condition.I would suggest you to share your pictures in a direct question and if you wish to contact me in future for any question kindly use the following link: youDr Hardik PitrodaM.D Dermatology"},{"Patient":"Hi, I am Puja form Kolkata,West Bangale.

But most of the people will acquire more pigmentation as age increases, we call it facultative pigmentation. Lot of factors determine it, most important being sunlight, others include dust, pollution, smoking, less hydration, intrinsic ageing and free radical damage, stress etc.Treatments should be to bring your pigmented skin back to your normal skin tone and make the skin tone even all over the body. I would recommend you to use a face wash twice a day ideally a one containing glycolic acid as it helps in exfoliation and to even out the skin tone.The most important product will be a sunscreen. Half an hour before going out apply a sunscreen and reapply it every three to four hours. At night you may apply a lightening cream containing kojic acid ( eg: Kojivit gel) over the face before going to sleep. You could apply a cream containing aloe vera to lighten your lip colour. If you are smoker, you need to quit smoking as this could lead to lip pigmentation.You may consult a dermatologist practicing cosmetology for few sittings of chemical peels for faster improvement.Hope I have answered your query.

It should mention both UV B and UV A coverage.

I will suggest you the best possible treatment options. First of all do not panic.  If you have delayed or irregular cycles, then please get USG done to rule out PCOS - polycystic ovaries.  Also, post menstrual HSG - hysterosalpingography will be of help to know about the patency of the fallopian tubes. And please get husband's semen analysis done.  This will help to know about quality and quantity of sperms in the semen. With the normalcy of these reports, you can get follicle study done from day 10 of the cycle.  You can simply opt for unprotected sex act or IUI on the day of ovulation.

Clinically it presents as light colored patches with fine, brawny scaling and post-inflammatory hypopigmentation.Pityriasis versicolor is a superficial fungal infection caused by Malassezia Furfur. The infection is more common in hot and humid weather conditions, which favor the growth of the fungus.A single oral dose of an oral antifungal e.g fluconazole 400 mg is curative OR Itraconazole 200 mg once daily for a week, is an alternative.If i were your treating dermatologist, i would have also asked you to apply 2% ketoconazole lotion over the whole affected while showering and leave it on for 5 minutes daily for 5 days.Post-inflammatory hypopigmentation takes some time to respond. Repigmentation can be hastened by daily sun exposure for 5-10 minutesRepeated recurrences are common and the patches may seem to persist for ever, with new patches appearing while older one resolve.Those who have repeated recurrences should use a prophylactic 3 days therapy with topical antifungals, every month i.e 2% ketoconazole lotion over the whole affected while showering and leave it on for 5 minutes daily for 5 days.Regards"},{"Patient":"During my pregnancy three years back, I had lots of pimples on my face.

Acne commonly resolves with postinflammatory hyperpigmentation. Darkness of face during pregnancy could be related to high ACTH levels giving rise to melasma.If I was the treating doctor I would suggest you to use a topical antibacterial e.g clindamycin gel for day time use over active acne,At night you could use a cream containing Azaleic acid 20% over the whole affected area, overnight. Azaleic acid is a topical retinoid, it is antibacterial, comedolytic as well as antiinflamatory. It also inhibits melanin synthesis through inhibition of tyrosinase enzyme. Therefore it would work for both acne as well as post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation as well as melasma.If you have inflammatory acne, I would prefer to start you on oral antibiotics e.g either doxycycline or azithromycin or minocycline.Always use a broad spectrum sunscreen, that which offers both UV B as well as UV A protection, throughout the day, to prevent further sun induced darkening.Regards"},{"Patient":"hello dr...my self nidhi and me 20 yr old...i have hyperpigmentation problem..i used melacare since 1 yr..bt now i feel my skin has been littel thin n also be a dark...so pls tell me proper topical cream which is steroid free ?? is melaglow or glyco a proper?","Doctor":"Hello dear,Welcome to HCm.i have read your query and understood your concern.You have correctly observed the changes.

Many options are available in chemical peels depending on the requirement and skin type. (Glycolic peel, retinol peel, cocktail peel etc)Also, chemical peeling can be preceded by a simple procedure called microderamabrasion or commonly known as skin polishing to augment the results.Also, at home you can try using cream containing kojic acid, tetrahydrocurcumin, arbutin etc for several months (Melaglow cream) for additional benefit and maintenance.Always use broad spectrum sunscreen before going out in sun.Use a plain moisturiser like cetaphil DAM on daily basis for healthy and hydrated skin.Take plenty of fresh fruits and vegetables in your daily diet.Kindly spare some time to rate my answer and drop your valuable review at the following link: you require any further assistance in future, you can reach me directly through the above mentioned link.Take careDr Hardik Pitroda"},{"Patient":"Dear doctor from last 6 month there are white marks in my both hands, i had gone to skin doctor, they had given me the lotion- vitilo and cream micogel , but still the marks are not gone, so pls give any other cream name or tablets so the marks on my hand get cure","Doctor":"HIThank for asking to HCMI really appreciate your concern looking to the history given here I could say that if this is vitiligo then one must continue the medicine for long time and for that the treatment need to done by the dermatologist, the regime of this disease goes on changing periodically, hope this information helps you, take care and have a nice day."},{"Patient":"sir, i have black shade on my both cheeks many medicine used but no change iam 52 aged person ,one of my friend advice me to use metasone plus cream & fluticasone oinment b.p. both mixe and apply . iam expecting your valuable advice . thank you doctor.","Doctor":"Hello and welcome to healthcaremagicHyperpigmentation of face, commonly known as melasma, is managed on 3 basic principle steps:-Inhibition of melanogenesis to prevent synthesis of new pigment and thus relapse.-Exfoliation to shed away the existing pigment and-Sun protection to prevent further sun induced darkeningIf I was the treating doctor I would suggest you to use a broad spectrum sunscreen throughout the day, that which offers both UV A as well as UV B protection. Reapply the sunscreen every 2-3 hours, in adequate quantity.At night you could use a cream containing one or more of the skin lightening agents like kojic acid, hydroquinone, azaleic acid etc. These ingredients inhibit synthesis of new pigment by inhibiting melanogenesis.Simultaneously you could also opt to undergo a few glycolic acid peeling sessions from a  dermatologist, to exfoliate existing pigment.Metasone plus cream is a triple drug combination of a topical steroid+hydroquinone+tretinoin. It is a gold standard combination for treatment of hyperpigmentation. Though it is very effective for facial hyperpigmentation, however, it should never be used without a dermatologist 's supervision because it may cause side effects like irritation, acne, photosensitivity etc.This combination is often misused by patients for extended periods of time and ultimately the patient lands up with side effects like acne, photosensitivity, telangiectases etc.In any case this combination should never be used for more than 2-3 months at a stretch because of fear of these side effects.Therefore I would suggest that you visit a dermatologist for proper advice regarding hyperpigmentation and follow up while you are using this cream.Regards"},{"Patient":"Am 56 and I have dark patches on my face on the cheekbones.

Any help; tips will be very much appreciated.","Doctor":"Hello and welcome to healthcaremagic.I have gone through your concern and i have understood it.Dark circles can be quite difficult to treat. Hereditary seems to play a significant role. In allergy prone individuals, a condition or state of 'atopy' exists & these atopic individuals more often than not manifest with 'dark circles' under the eyes.It also depends a lot on your lifestyle pattern- diet, sleep, computer / TV use and stress. Stressors/ Strain due to working for long hours on computers & lack of sleep play a major role tooThin under eye skin is also a factor in causing dark circles, the thin skin makes the blood vessels under the skin very prominent and hence this appears dark. You could benefit from using a cream containing Vitamin K and Retinol( EGA cream). Use it once a day for at least 3 months to notice a difference.Another important cause of undereye dark circles is Iron deficiency Anemia. As can be judged from some of the reasons cited, good hydration, regular 6-8 hours of sleep, addressing stressors and a multivitamin and Iron supplement by themselves will go a long way in correcting this issue.Skin lightening cream containing glycolic acid, kojic acid, Vit C can be helpful in reducing the appearance of dark circles.Glycolic acid and Arginine peels are the two commonly used peels by dermatologists for undereye dark circles. You can try a few peeling sessions (6-8 sessions)Regards"},{"Patient":"Hi, I am KC Das from Bhubaneswar. I have few white spots in my both of the arms.

As seborrheic dermatitis often recurs and since it is not advisable to use topical steroids on face for long therefore after the initial 2 weeks steroids should be replaced with a topical imunomodulator e.g either pimecrolimus or tacrolimus, for maintenance of improvement.regards"},{"Patient":"hi my name is Miss. subha. am 28 years old. Am using lomela for past 7 months. it shows good result to my face. but when i stop using it, my face becomes dark. After continuing with lomela i got a clear skin again. whether it is good for continuous use of lomela.","Doctor":"Hello,Welcome to healthcare magic.Lomela cream contains a mid potent steroid mometasone, hydroquinone and retinoid and it is not an over the counter preparation. It should be prescribed by a dermatologist who knows which condition to start it for and when to stop. We do not recommend it daily for more than a month following which we taper it and stop and add on a non steroidal lightening cream. Moreover it is used in pigmentary disorders like melasma and not for improving skin tone. Long term use can cause steroid induced rosacea, acne, thinning of skin, redness, rebound skin darkening and increased sensitivity to sunlight. Please stop using this cream.Use a sunscreen with SPF 30 or more every 2-3 hrs during the day even if you are indoors. Avoid sun exposure as much as possible. Apply non steroidal lightening cream containing kojic acid at night. Hope this helps you.Take care."},{"Patient":"hi doctor,im having acne comendones,its moderate.i have already tried retia a and clindamycin but not gettin relief.i am 21 yrs old,male.im also having acne scars and some tiny black pigments like mole.what can i do to get relief from these pigmentation and scars","Doctor":"Hello,Welcome to healthcare magic.I understand that you are having comedones and acne scars, along with black mole like lesions.If the comedones are not responding to topical gels, you may benefit from getting comedone extraction procedure done by a dermatologist. This will hasten the clearance of the lesions. You could continue the gels you are currently using while you do this procedure.Acne scars can be treated by procedures like microneedling and lasers. However, this can be started only after the active acne has cleared.The black, mole like spots on the face could be lesions called as \\" Dermatosis papillosa nigra\\".

Many options are available in chemical peels depending on the requirement and skin type. (Glycolic peel, retinol peel, cocktail peel etc)Also, chemical peeling can be preceded by a simple procedure called microderamabrasion or commonly known as skin polishing to augment the results.At home, you can use cream containing kojic acid, tetrahydrocurcumin, arbutin etc (Melaglow cream) and topical Vitamin C serum for several months  for additional benefit and maintenance.Always use broad spectrum sunscreen before going out in sun.Use a plain moisturiser like cetaphil DAM on daily basis for healthy and hydrated skin.Take plenty of fresh fruits and vegetables in your daily diet.Hope this will take care of your issue.If you require any of my assistance in future you may reach me directly via the following link: you best of health.Thank you and take care,Dr Hardik PitrodaM.D Dermatology"},{"Patient":"Dear Doctor, I suspect that due to my intake of birth control pills and recent exposure to sun for 4-5 days have caused dark spots on my skin (on the upper lip) and white spots on my cheeks and cheek bones.

However personally I do not advocate use of glutathione. My take on your skin concern would be treat your uneven skin tone, acne scars and pores. Please do not go with skin lightening treatment as results achieved would be temporary and skin color per se cannot be changed.Salicylic acid and retinol( yellow peels) would help you to reduce tanning, oiliness,acne marks,  and pores( to some extent). If you have too many scars, go with microdermabrasion or dermarollers. Use a good quality sunscreen to maintain results. Do not go with glutathione injections etc.Take care"},{"Patient":"Hello.

It is possible to be pregnant if you had intercourse during your fertile period (ovulation day and 3days prior to that). This is usually in the middle third of your cycle. The spotting, vomiting don't seem related to pregnancy. It could be an isolated incident. A sure sign of a possible pregnancy is a missed period and positive pregnancy test after you have missed your period. Please take a home pregnancy test to check, once you have missed your period. If negative, I recommend :- basal body temperature monitoring & using ovulation prediction kits to detect ovulation day. This day and the three days before that are your most fertile period. -regular intercourse (every alternate day) in the middle third of your cycle (day 10 to 20 in a 30 day cycle, for instance). -minimize caffeine -maintain healthy diet and weight. -exercise regularly. Don't stress to much while trying. It doesn't help and Infact can negatively impact fertility. -take a folic acid supplement everyday. -if below 30 yrs, try for a year and of above 30,for 6 months before seeking professional help. It will happen. Keep trying. Don't get frustrated. Take a break of the pressure of trying to conceive gets too much. Hope this helps. Wish you well.

The skin becomes dark, velvety and thick in areas such as back and sides of neck, armpits, thighs, elbows and knees.Acanthosis nigricans usually appears slowly and doesn't cause any symptoms other than skin changes.It typically occurs in individuals younger than age 40, may be genetically inherited, and is associated with obesity OR endocrinopathies, such as hypothyroidism, acromegaly, polycystic ovary disease, insulin-resistant diabetes, or Cushing's disease.The majority of cases of acanthosis nigricans are associated with obesity OR are otherwise idiopathic. This is likely because of insulin resistance, and more likely to occur in darker-skinned persons. This is also known as Pseudo-Acanthosis Nigricans.Acanthosis nigricans is likely to improve in circumstances where a known cause is removed. For example, obesity-related acanthosis nigricans will improve with weight loss.People with acanthosis nigricans in general should be screened for diabetes. Weight loss and controlling blood glucose levels through exercise and diet often improves symptoms.Topical tretinoin 0.05% cream once daily at night helps to lighten pigmentation along with weight loss, exercise and diet management.Alpha-Lipoic acid ha been shown to increase insulin sensitivity and thereby reverses the pseudo-acanthosis nigricans which arises as a result of insulin resistance states e.g Obesity and diabetes.

I do not have any kids at this stage so my question is what are the chances of pregnancy if any and if my embreyo s are to be harvested will they be healthy and will there be any to be harvested.regardsQueen","Doctor":"HelloThank you for your query. Am so sorry that you are going through this. Yes, getting pregnant is definitely a concern, given your diagnosis. Oocyte (egg) cryopreservation should be considered at this point. This involves stimulating your ovary to develop multiple eggs and harvest them when they mature. These are then frozen for future use. Factors that affect this are:-the staging of the tumor (about 80%are benign). If it is malignant, then removal has to be immediate. In this case pregnancy is unlikely. -hormone levels (testosterone, estrogen, follicle stimulating hormone, Leutinizing hormone, and mullerian hormone). This determines if you ovulate normally.-if you have had chemotherapy or radiotherapy previously. This affects the quality and viability of the eggs. I recommend :-consult your OBGYN /fertility specialist and oncologist right away to discuss options. -a thorough and detailed evaluation is necessary before considering options -please consider all your options calmly before deciding. If you have a partner, you could consider fertilizing and freezing the embryos for implantation at a later time or surrogacy, if the need arises. Else, Oocyte preservation can be done. Sorry, I wish I could have given you a more positive answer. Hope this helps. Please let me know if there is anything else I can help you with.

It prevents ovulation and pregnancy and is usually prescribed in regulating periods, abnormal bleeding, and hormonal imbalances.*Were you prescribed this due to the absence of period or due to any other reason? *What are your height and weight? *Do you have any other medical issues or take any medications? *Are your periods regular? *How old are you? *Do you have children? Have you been pregnant before? As you are trying to get pregnant I recommend:-Stop the pill.-An obstetrician-gynecologist consult to make sure all is well to get pregnant. -Regular intercourse every alternate day at least, especially in the middle third of your cycle. -A folic acid supplement every day. -Basal body temperature monitoring and ovulation prediction kits to help detect ovulation date (if periods are regular). Ovulation day and 3 days before this day is your most fertile period. -Maintain a healthy weight. -Reduce stress and caffeine. -Eat healthy and exercise whenever possible. -Stay well hydrated. If below 30, try for a year. If above 30, for 6 months. If negative, see a fertility specialist to check you both for fertility issues.Hormone level imbalances can prevent pregnancy. This needs to be assessed thoroughly. Hope this helps. Please let me know if there is anything else I can help you with. Wish you good health and hope that you conceive soon.Regards,Dr. Shuba Hariprasad"},{"Patient":"Hi My name is Preet from Slough United Kingdom.

However there are well known causes like pregnancy, oral contraceptive pills, certain pain killers.You have been on the right treatment for melasma, results can take some time, usually 2-3 months and even longer. It is important to protect from sun during the treatment for melasma, otherwise you might see the desired results. I hope you are using a sunscreen,though you did'nt mentionA good sunscreen should have broad spectrum UV A coverage in addition to UV B coverage, in order to be able to prevent tanning and it needs to be applied in sufficient quantity and every 2-3 hourly.I don't see sunscreen in your treatment. A sunscreen with minimum 30 SPF would be adequate. It should mention both UV B and UV A coverage. Therefore it is important to select the right sunscreen for desired effectsIt should be applied in the following quantity:--3ml for face and neck(a little more than 1/2 teaspoon)--3ml for each arm(a little more than 1/2 teaspoon).A sunscreen should be applied every 2-3 hours.You can opt for a few Chemical peeling sessions from a dermatologist.

Melalite -XL cream should never be used for dark circles because it is not meant for dark circles and moreover it can cause irritation and further thinning of the already thin skin around the eye.Hereditary seems to play a significant role. In allergy prone individuals, a condition or state of 'atopy' exists & these atopic individuals more often than not manifest with 'dark circles' under the eyes.It also depends a lot on your lifestyle pattern- diet, sleep, computer / TV use and stress. Stressors/ Strain due to working for long hours on computers & lack of sleep play a major role too.Dark circles due to thin under eye skin, the thin skin makes the blood vessels under the skin very prominent and hence this appears dark. You could benefit from using a cream containing Vitamin K and Retinol( EGA cream). Use it once a day for at least 3 months to notice a difference.Another important cause of undereye dark circles is Iron deficiency Anemia.As can be judged from some of the reasons cited, good hydration, regular 6-8 hours of sleep, addressing stressors and a multivitamin and Iron supplement  by themselves will go a long way in correcting this issue.Skin lightening cream containing glycolic acid, kojic acid, Vit C can be helpful in reducing the appearance of dark circles. Glycolic acid and Arginine peels are the two commonly used peels by dermatologists for undereye dark circles. You can try a few peeling sessions (6-8 sessions).regards"},{"Patient":"My husband has a large, circular red ring under one of his armpits. The ring is approximately the size of an orange. We are using Cortisone cream at present. What could be the cause of this condition? Would you suggest I take him to a doctor immediately?","Doctor":"Hello and welcome to healthcaremagicI would keep a possibility of fungal infection. This are because of closely apposing body folds e.g thighs and groin, axilla, submammary folds etc can trap sweat, heat and moisture, therefore making the area favorable for fungal proliferation.If I was the treating doctor I would have asked you to use a topical antifungal like clotrimazole cream, twice daily, regularly for 4 weeks. An Oral antifungal e.g fluconazole once weekly for4 -6 weeks OR oral terbinafine once daily for 2-4 weeks, is also advisable for a more complete cureAn OTC antihistamine e.g cetrizine 10mg once daily would help you in symptomatic itch relief.Keeping the folds dry by using an antifungal dusting powder would help in preventing the recurrence.regards"},{"Patient":"Hello sir, I have a issue with my skin..

Usually a series of sessions are performed for hyperpigmentation of the skin. Results depend on the kind of peel and the underlying condition,to some extent.

Therefore, while chemical peeling gives good results, they should be followed up with a maintenance regime/cream so that the results are not reversed after the peeling is discontinued,particularly for melasma.Sunscreens are an essential part of pigmentation treatment and it is advisable to use a broad spectrum sunscreen, throughout the day.regards"},{"Patient":"Hi...

So at this point I don t know what to do, I have been using this ointment for about 3 to 4 years and I am now 16, I an really disliking this condition. Also I don t think it s due to health issues because I drink plenty of water and I control by meals and make sure it s balanced. However I did have angular cheilities before, and this ointment seems to make that disappear but not the darkness. I just really want the darkness in the corners of my lips to disappear.","Doctor":"Hi,I can understand your concern for dark patches at the corner of the lips.It appears from your query that you are suffering from \\" Dyssebacia\\" or angular chelietis. It is due to blockage and plugging of the sebaceous glands, especially around the nose. The dry flakes which falls off from the skin are dry and yellowish material.You need not to be worried about this condition. It is common in your age group.For the betterment you eat a lot of fruits containing B complex with some multivitamin capsules also. You can apply \\"Fluticasone\\" cream or Ketoconazole 2% cream twice a day in a very thin layer. IF despite above treatment the things recurs then you can meet a dermatologist.Hope this information helps you."},{"Patient":"hi doctor bansal as u suggested me to use EUMOSONE-M i m using since 2 month i feel good but whn i left for 1 day my problems again attack on face ncuts nose joints and ear joints.i am takeing heamup  tablets everyday but there is no changes on my dark face.","Doctor":"Hello,Thanks for the query.This hyper pigmentation can be removed by using skin lightening creams.Various creams are available like melalite xl, lookbrite, Lumaglow etc.You can take any of them.This will help in getting a fairer toneThe following should be procedure to use it.1.

Candid B cream is an anti-fungal cream with steroid. This cream is used only in specific dermatological conditions as prescribed a qualified physician.There are a variety of skin disorders causing dark pigmentation. The most commonest cause of dark pigmentation on cheeks in an elderly lady is a condition called Melasma.The cause of melasma is complex. There is a genetic predisposition to melasma, with at least one-third of patients reporting other family members to be affected. In most people melasma is a chronic disorder.  Sun exposure, pregnancy, hormonal changes, photo-toxic reaction to Scented or deodorant soaps, toiletries and cosmetics or medications are the commonest triggering factors of Melasma. There are different modalities of treatment for Melasma and i would recommend you to consult a qualified Dermatologist for an expert opinion regarding your mother's skin condition and treatment."},{"Patient":"hello,  I get  cold sore at least 3 times a yr when I am super stress.  however, the skin on my lips and around my lips has gotten really dark making it very obvious.

You have been using melacare since one year now. Melacare cream is a topical cream containing 3 active ingredients which are Hydroquinone, Tretinoin and Mometasone.This cream is commonly used for facial pigmentation but it is very important to use it under strict medical supervision. It is not to be used continuously for more than 2 to 3 three months at a stretch and u have to applly only in night time. Mometasone is a strong steroid and long term use of this may lead to redness, itching, thinning of skin, excessive hair growth,photo sensitivity.Prolonged use of hydroquinone especially during day time can lead to permanent pigmentation over face. First thing STOP USING THIS CREAM RIGHT NOW. For the skin pigmentation that you have developed, you need to start using some milder lightening agents in the form of kojic acid during day time and azelaic acid during night. Both of these have to be applied only over the affected areas.Use a sunscreen lotion with spf more than 26 regularly over your face atleast 20 minutes before going out in the sun. Reapply it every 3-4 hourly if you have prolonged sun exposure. Take oral vitamin c supplementation alongside atleast twice a day. It acts as a systemic lightening agent. Consume lots of fruits, vegetables, eat lots of citrus fruits.Try these for 2-3 months safely, however if you feel that there is not satisfactory improvement, then I would recommend you to see a dermatologist as there are various other treatment options available in the form of chemical peels, dermabrasion and laser treatments which can be done for facial pigmentation.I think i answered your query.

I had the old mole checked up before and was told it was benign. Anyway it concerned me so I asked the doctor to take a look. He didn t make much comments on it but wrote me a referral to a specialist and suggest I get a biopsy there. I ve tried scratching at the brown spot and scrubbing at it. It s definitely not dirt or anything as it did not budge at all but I just looked at it and it has disappeared leaving a slight bump. Should I be concerned about this? I have not seen the specialist yet but would like not to if it isn t anything serious.","Doctor":"Hello! Thank you for the query. No doctor is able to tell if the mole is benign or malignant without removing it and sending for histopathology. Dermatologist are able to establish if the mole is in high risk of melanoma malignum. It can be done with dermatoscope. But the final diagnose can be set only when you do remove it and check for cancer cells under the microscope. If the mole changes its size, color, gets painful, redness appears around, gets more prominent, the verges are uneven, the mole is suspicious and should be removed. Otherwise, it should be left alone. Hope this will help.

No one can guarantee a cure for it but with right form of treatment and strict adherence, it can be remarkably improved.Skinlite cream contains mometasone, hydroquinone and tretinoin. It works wonderfully well on Melasma but it has limitataions like: It cannot be used on face for more than 2-3 months  for fear of causing steroid related adverse effects.Sunscreen is an important component of any skin lightening therapy. I advice my patients to use a broad spectrum sunscreen with protection against both UVA and UVB. It should be worn throughout the day.I prefer to use non-steroid based creams like the ones containing kojic acid, hydroquinone, glycolic acid, arbutin, Azaleic acid, magnesium ascorbyl phosphate, liquorice etc in various combinations. They are safe to use on long term basis unlike steroid based creams.I also combine chemical peeling sessions along with topical treatment in my patients of melasma  for a faster response which can then be maintained with topical creams and sunscreens."},{"Patient":"Hello, my husband and I just decided we wanted a baby and we don't want to wait.

Thanks for posting your concern at HCM.Acne and Acne induced pigmentation are common among young people.Specific treatment:Oral Antibiotics: For inflammatory acne(papules and pustules) i advice my patients to start with one of the oral antibiotics like Azithromycin/ Doxycycline/ Minocycline.Topical treatment: Is a valuable adjunct to any form of acne treatment. Mainly two classes of drugs are used topically1)Topical Antibacterials: Dermatologists around the world prescribe topical gels/creams containing topical antibiotics like either clindamycin 1%/ benzoyl peroxide 2.5% OR Nadifloxacin during the day time.2)Topical Retinoids: Either Adapalene 0.1%/ Tretinoin 0.025% OR Azaleic acid (10%/20%) at bed time.Topical treatment regimen especially the one which includes one of the retinoids that i mentioned above also helps to gradually fade away the black spots (post acne hyperpigmentation)(PAH)Since, you mentioned that you have both acne as well as black spots from previous acne. In such a case i prefer to give Azaleic acid cream/gel. It acts both on acne as well as black spots.

My first  question: Do you know of any connection between early ultrasounds and miscarriages?Next, 5 days ago, I was given two Misoprostol (Cytotec) pills to prepare me for a D+C procedure to remove the fetus, but the first pill sent me into full miscarriage the night before, with contractions, etc. The doctor told me not to take the second pill when I called her to tell her about the pain and bleeding. I postponed the surgery and two days later had more contractions and got rid of more fetal material. I went to have an ultrasound and the doctor said that the sac was completely gone but that my uterus lining was still thick at 12mm. I am happy that I have avoided surgery. I am going to doctor to check uterus lining in 2 weeks. I am not bleeding much at all now though so I wonder how the uterus will return to normal--with my next period?  Also, how long should I wait before trying to get pregnant again...?Thank you!Christina in Athens, Greece","Doctor":"Hello Christina, Thank you for your query. I hope you won't mind me answering your query. Your body has naturally expelled the fetal tissues. Bleeding can last for upto 2 weeks. As long as you don't have abdominal pain, fever, foul smelling discharge, and prolonged /increased bleeding, you should be fine. Ovulation usually occurs within 2-4 weeks after miscarriage and period will occur within 2 weeks after that. It may be a little heavier and longer than your usual period. It should regularize after that. The body takes a while to get back to normal:- to make up for lost blood-for hormone levels to normalize-uterus to regain its normal size. I recommend :-waiting for 3 months before trying to conceive again-continue folic acid supplement. -take an iron supplement everyday for 3 months (depending on your hemoglobin and iron levels in the blood) More than 80% of women go on to have a normal pregnancy after a miscarriage. Hope you conceive soon. Take care Hope I've answered your query. Wish you good health."},{"Patient":"I have got a very tiny white spot on my arm from about 1 month.

Anyways their are mutiple modalities available: Ideally you should use a broadspectrum sunscreen with all forms of treatment, which protects you both from UVB and UVA rays and apply it every 3-4 hours.A treatment plan which combines exfoliation of already existing pigment with that which reduces synthesis of new melanin works better than undergoing just exfoliation of existing pigment(like you are undergoing glycolic peels)Demelan contains glycolic acid, which is exfoliating and will help reduce existing pigment and it contains kojic acid and arbutin, both of them help reduce synthesis of new pigment.

If above 30, try for a couple more months before seeing a fertility specialist. I recommend :- regular intercourse, every alternate day atleast, during the middle third of your cycle. -basal body temperature monitoring and ovulation prediction kits can help to detect ovulation day. This day and three days prior to this are your most fertile period. Time intercourse appropriately. -take a folic acid supplement everyday. Improper /irregular intercourse, Thyroid problems, hormonal imbalances, obesity, stressful life can all affect fertility. Minimize caffeine, exercise and eat a healthy diet. Urine infection:- drink plenty of water-avoid spicy foods and carbonated drinks-maintain regular hygiene. If symptoms persist more than 5 days of the above measures,:-see a OBGYN - to check for vaginal Infection as well-urine analysis. Treat according to results.

Please type your query here...Hi my g/f 's period is not coming more than one week of usual period after taking i-pill. When i test the velocit for pregnancy, there is two line one is very distinct and other is not clear. Is it pregnant or not.","Doctor":"Hi there, I have understood your concern. I will suggest you the best possible treatment options. As you have mentioned that urine pregnancy test indicates 2 lines , it indicates test to be positive for pregnancy.  If you want, you can repeat the test on morning's first sample of urine. In case of doubt blood beta HCG test and USG will be of help. As you may be aware that emergency contraceptive pills are effective to prevent the pregnancy when taken within 24 to 72 hours of unprotected sex act. If your partner had taken the pills in that period then chance of preventing the pregnancy is maximum.  Even if she is pregnant, you can opt for termination of the pregnancy with medicines safely till 9 weeks of pregnancy under medical supervision. I hope this answer helps you. Thanks.

Next, if your daughter has the symptoms of flu, most probably virosis might be the cause of her body aches.

With regards to black bumps which turn red with white head, most probably it might be of a skin infection, for which oral and topical treatment is needed.

My Query is  1.whether hypepigementation caused due to dermaroller can be cured permanently...because i am really scared by looking my face in the mirror  2. Whether it requires 6 sessions of chemical peels to get rid of hyperpigmentation.  3. Is their any alternative remedy to get rid of hyperpigmentation in fast because i dont have that much time for campus placements  4. what about meladerm cream for hyperpigmentation.... because one of my friend told that it can get rid of hyperpigmentation? Is it good?   Pls answer my quries.. I am really confused","Doctor":"Hi, usually pigmentation post roller is unusual, secondly sittings every week for roller is unnecessary as collagen modulation is a slow process and will not depend on how quickly sessions are done.pigmentation cud be removed not to worry.ya 6 sessions of glycolic acid peels can be done with may be a hydroquinone or kojic acid peelyou may apply a hydroquinone cream in morn and glycolic acid cream at night instead of hhlite cream as it may aggravate acne and may cause irritation.meladerm cream is not an fda approved producttake care"},{"Patient":"I am a 33 year old female with rheumatoid arthritis and slightly overweight .

It really annoys me so I want to get rid of it. What I heard from other people, Laser treatments are not really effective and complex. On the other hand I ve read from a lot of people that they got a Tattoo over their becker nevus and they are absolut happy with it. I also heard that Tattoo shouldn t be made over moles/nevus because after you can t see anymore if they change (for example cancer ). But I also heard that a becker nevus is a benign/innocent mole that shouldnt change into cancer. So I think the risk of getting a Tattoo over it should be small. What do you think?","Doctor":"Hi,Thanks for writing to us.Few lasers like q switched laser or IPL show good results in becker's nevus. However a number of sessions might be required.If its a small nevi and that too in covered area of body, it is better to leave it as such. How would tattooing the area enhance its beauty. If you get bored with the tattoo again you might have to get lasers done. Chances of a Becker nevus turning malignant is almost negligible.

I am seeing a fertility specialist. On June 11th, I took a home pregnancy test (positive) The following day June 12, I had HCG and Progesterone drawn. 6/12: Progesterone 33 HCG 59 6/14: Progesterone 35 HCG 149 6/ 17: Progesterone 24.8 HCG 294 My doctor says that I should be cautiously optimistic at this point. I have had one other pregnancy and it resulted in a miscarriage at 7 1/2 weeks. I am 29, 5 3 140lbs. I take Metformin to control my insulin. I also had an HCG injection to trigger my ovulation and Clomid 100mg. Realistically, how do things look for my baby?","Doctor":"Hello, Thank you for your query.  The blood values don't look promising. Hcg values should double up every 2 days in a healthy pregnancy and is usually seen in about 80%of healthy pregnancies. However, the remaining 20%can still have a normal pregnancy. The better prognostic factor is the presence of a heart beat detected by an ultrasound between 6-8 weeks from the last menstrual period. The presence of a heartbeat is a sure. Sign that your baby is thriving. Clomid and a trigger shot help in increasing your chances of conceiving & sustaining the pregnancy initially. After implantation, progesterone levels (natural or supplements) help in maintaining the level of hcg to ensure proper development of your baby. As these values vary widely within the normal range, it is better to wait for the scan to check for viability. I am sorry you are going through this. I hope this helps.

If it is due to simple tanning then your cream - Hyclean would be beneficial to improve the pigmentation. It contains sunscreen and skin bleaching agents so giving you dual benefit. It is to be applied thinly, preferably at night time but can be applied at day time also. One pea size amount over the finger tip is sufficient for palm size of skin. Do not rub it over the affected area or direct exposure to sun, otherwise can cause irritation.If it is lichen amyloidosis then all the treatments actually are less effective. You take guidance from your dermatologist regarding exact cause of the pigmentation. She would guide you for the same. It has to be applied at least for 2-3 months to see visible results.

Hydroquinone is a weak hypopigmenting drug. The response is often incomplete and pigmentation recurs once the drug is stopped. You should avoid  sunlight also otherwise, there will be an increase in the level of pigmentation.Tretinoin is added as it reduces  wrinkles, dry scaly surfaces and sagging of skin. Mometasone is a topical steroid and prevents inflammation. Although the absorption of steroid through topical route is minimal, it should not be used for a prolonged period.All the three drugs can cause itching, burning and allergic reactions. It should not used continuously for a long time. Go for preparations with aloe vera and apply olive oil and almond oil on the spots. This will reduce the pigmentation and will give a permanent remedy.I hope this is useful."},{"Patient":"I have problem with my skin on both legs.

Vitamin E, known for its healing qualities, helps nourish skin and fade scars. Open a vitamin E capsule and apply gel directly to the scars twice a day until you see them start to fade, then apply once a day thereafter. Eat foods rich in vitamin K. These are good for your skin because vitamin K helps heal and protect skin from wounds and scars. Slice a fresh lemon and brush across your chicken-pox scars. Coat chicken-pox scars liberally in honey once a day. Rub raw garlic on your chicken-pox scars at night. If your scars are new, rub sandalwood oil on them.

Pigmentation around the mouth could be due to conditions like seborrhoeic melanosis ( darkening due to oily skin), familial, vitamin B 12 deficiency, thyroid abnormalities . Kojivit is a good lightening cream which could help you to lighten the pigmentation after ruling out underlying problems. Few sessions of chemical peels by a cosmetologist will also help. 2.for your recent chicken pox scars, kojiviit can be applied on the dark scars. However, if they are depressed scars, you may need dermaosurgicsl procedures like subcision. This can be done after  the scars are mature , ie,after 3 months. You should also use a good sunscreen. 3.home remedies - you can make a facepack of ground almonds and lemon which act as a mild chemical peel. Tomato and cucumber act as good astringents. Have a good diet with lots of coloured fruits and vegetables rich in beta carotene, vitamin c like tomatoes, capsicum, carrots, pumpkin and broccoli.

All my friends fearing me it must be a rash... wat can i do?/ further continue the cream or stop it at once... and also black heads also turned to pale ou... is the cream safer or has more effect to cause side effects in furtur?","Doctor":"Lomela cream contains a mid potent steroid mometasone, hydroquinone and retinoid and it is not an over the counter preparation. It should be prescribed by a dermatologist who knows which condition to start it for and when to stop. We do not recommend it daily for more than a month following which we taper it and stop and add on a non steroidal lightening cream. Moreover it is used in pigmentary disorders like melasma and not for improving skin tone. Long term use can cause steroid induced Rosacea, Acne, Thinning of skin, Redness and increased sensitivity to sunlight. Use a sunscreen with spf 30 or more every 2-3 hrs during the day even if you are indoors. Avoid sun exposure as much as possible. Apply non steroidal lightening cream containing kojic acid at night. Hope this helped Take care"},{"Patient":"I have dark patches occuring on my face.  it started with slight marks on the cheeks which increased in size and now the mark also came on forehead.  doctor diagnosed it as melasma and prescribed Melalite-XL cream for 6 weeks and later reducing it with melalong.  There has been no improvement in the marks though.  I tried using Eumosome - m on the marks and i saw visible difference with the marks getting lighter.  I feel its not melasma.  Can you advise your diagnosis please.  Thanks a ton.","Doctor":"Dear Pami, Welcome to HCM. After reading your problem the most common possibility appears to be Melasma only. I think you are a young female of age between 20-30. Now there could be second possibility of Post Inflammatory Hyperpigmentation( appearing after any skin problem). But as per your question it does' not appear that any rash or something occurred on your face. Now for Melasma, it is a condition of hyperpigmentation occurring mainly over cheeks and sometimes on forehead too in superficial or deeper pigmentation.  It is considered to be a hormonal problem due to female hormones. Though it can occur frequently in men  too. Now that you were prescribed with Melalite-XL cream for 6 weeks and later with Melalong. Both of these contains Hydroquinone as the main content which is bleaching agent. The deeper pigmentation does not respond to this, which is the reason of no improvement in the marks. Response to Eumosone is variable thing, as is a type of topical STEROID- and every skin condition responds well in the beginning, but is a double edged sword- giving benefit in beginning but later making dependency and innumerable side effects. So Kindly stop using that if you are not using for long term or slowly taper it off. You can ask your doctor for best and safest possible therapy for you which can be used for a longer period of time. Hope to hae justified with your problem and query, With best of wishes for healthy glowing skin, Dr Sanjay K Kanodia"},{"Patient":"At my last OB visit my Dr question pigmentation loss on my vaginal area.

But after the pus, some blood oozed out and left a dark brown hyperpigmentation scar. The brown scar is slightly raised. I have a tendency to peel thinking the skin underneath will be of regular colour but each time it darkens again with slightly elevated skin. Ive tried microdermabrasions, chemical peels, hydroquinone since 10 months in vain. Whats the best method to treat hyperpigmentation pimple raised brown scar?","Doctor":"Dear Lola, Hi and welcome to HCM. It appears from your query that you are overdoing your efforts to get rid of the scar. You know our skin needs bit of rest to get its normal texture. when we are doing a lot of things then it actually cause s more of post inflammatory hypermelanosis/ post inflammatory hyperpigmenation (PIH). Other wise also from your query it appears to be two problems- the one is Scar and the other one is Pigmentation. You might get some relief in pigmentation but to get rid of scar is really difficult one. The very first thing you should do is - kindly stop doing any thing for a period of at least 3-4 week. As it will come out i its natural shape so would be better to be analyzed for pigmentation. You can try use azelaic acid cream, Kojic acid cream, glycolic acid cream, licorice extract or arbutine under medical supervision. The last option would be Fraxel Laser by an expertize hands who can judge your situation and can go for it accordingly. Hope this information will help you out of your problem.

Since 2005 I have had this black pigmentation on my thigh. It does not hurt or itch or feel any different from the rest of my skin. It is like a birth mark. But over the last three 3years it has started to fade. What could have caused this?","Doctor":"Dear Kimacholonu, Hi and welcome to Healthcare Magic. The black pigmentation on your thigh is known as Post Inflammatory Hyperpigmentation/ Post Inflammatory Hypermelanosis (PIH). It is a condition of the skin arising from trauma ( of any nature) to the skin resulting healing with pigmentation. Now to explain in your situation, you might have had a rash arising from either insect bite or due purpura (extravasation of blood in skin due to many a causes) or due to so many reasons. It is a superficial skin change in first instance. But then as you scratched, it caused deeper injury to the skin. Due to this deeper injury it stimulated the melanocytes (the color producing cells of the skin) which  turned the rash into black pigmentation. This is totally a normal process which is a part of healing phenomenon in any injury to skin. So if the injury is superficial it does not generally leave a mark but if the injury is deep it will leave blackish brown mark.  PIH is an asymptomatic (without any symtom of pain or itching) condition. Now you should also understand that our skin is daily renewing itself so the pigmentation which is deeper it gets lighter as the skin is renewed. After few years of period it will be faintly visible or not visible at all !! I hope you got your answer and next time you will ask the person in circle that not to scratch or rub any injury/ Rash.

For your son, you protect his skin from sun rays and enviormental pollutants. Improve his health with nutritional suppliments. Tanning of skin should be avoided with the help of sun screen lotion.

Generally these spots are triggered by hormone estrogen, melanin or sun. Chloasma spots occer due to age. Sunscreen formulations may help. Hydroquinone topical ointment at night can be used over the spots. It decreases melanin production. This helps only if the pigmentation is superficial & not deep.

I am obese, and I also have a disease of PCOS ( Poly cystic ovarian syndrome ) The doctor told me the only way to get rid of the dark spots is by losing weight, offered me some treatment of Tretinoin Gel, 0.01%. I have used the Gel before around my neck, I have never gotten a reaction from it! It actually lighten up the skin around my neck, made some of the dark spots go away. I have been working out, trying to lose weight by taking Metformin to prevent the high level of insulin resistance on my neck. I just recently saw a doctor again bc I moved out of state, my prescription was over due. I had to get another prescription note, when I went to pick up my medication from the clinic. They screwd up and gave me Tretinoin Cream, it s 40 g. It some how made a reaction on my skin, made me break out in a rash, it itches around my neck, thighs. I have really really bad dark spots in between my thighs, and I m trying to get good skin. But the doctors I have been seeing in the past have been screwing up on my body. I had a cyst in my right ovary before, it was huge. Instead of going through the surgery they decided to put me on different birth control pills to help dry out the cyst in my right ovary. The cyst was to big to dry out, so I had surgery done. They did a larparascopy on me, and a DNC with getting the polyps in my body, they also stuck a IUD ( merina ) inside of me which made me gain a lot of weight. Luckily, after that happen I was okay but after that the IUD popped out of my uterus wall because of being heavy weight. After being on so many different birth control pills I had no idea that the oral contraceptives causes discoloration in the skin. I was also on the Yaz, Microgestin FE, IUD, Depo prover shot, Prover pills and some other that I forgot. The abnormal bleeding stopped, and I stopped with taking the oral contraceptives. But it damaged the skin cells in my body, and I wanted to know how to get rid of it. I have been diagnoised with Ancanothis Nigerican which is related to my pcos. Do you have any suggestions of how to get rid of the dark spots on my neck? I never had it this bad but after using the tretinioin cream it made me break out in a rash, it itches. The itching in between my thighs went away but after I stopped using it. It gotten a lot worse in between my thighs. Any suggestions of what to use to get rid of the itchy, the hyper pigmentation in between my thighs? I have taking fish oil supplements, that has been helping a lot as well!","Doctor":"Hi, Thanks for the detailed information provided by you . The pigmentation around the neck, thighs , breast abdomen is Pseudo acanthosis nigricans.There is no  damage of skin cells after taking contraceptives. It is related to obesity. So the best way to reduce this pigmentation is weight reduction. Creams like tretinoin may be used to reduce pigmentation .Tretinoin can cause hypersensitivity reaction in the skin in the form of itching and rashes as has happened  in your case. You may stop applying tretinoin cream and apply a moderate steroid like momatosone for a few days, this will help in reducing redness and itching can be taken care of with an antihistaminic. You may continue taking fish oil supplements. After the rash disappears you may restart tretinoin gel 0.01 % for 2hours , slowly increasing the duration if no rashes appear Hope this helps you"},{"Patient":"Hi!

Do a thyroid profile and prolactin levels and ultrasound for your uterus and ovaries. You can try medicines for growth of your follicles and track the growth of your follicles by repeated ultrasound and when your follicles are more than 17 to 18 mm, take injection for rupturing the follicles. You can go for intrauterine insemination (IUI) if you are not able to do sexual intercourse naturally. Take progesterone for the next two weeks. Do a urine pregnancy test at home after that.

Firstly it is important to know whether the darkness of toes or fingers is a primary phenomenon or it occurred secondarily to some eczema, chill Blains etc. so that a proper treatment can be offered. Emoderm is an emollient or a moisturising cream and it would rarely induce itching. To relieve itching, take tablet cetirizine and apply a steroid cream like betamethasone or mometasone. Once the itching is gone, pigmentation can be reduced with an emollient cream containing Glycolic acid, urea etc ( Xerina cream) Hope that helps"},{"Patient":"Hi, I have these dry red patches on the back of my hands that basically look like a fingerless glove.

It is a hormonal contraceptive.  So, from next cycle you can start taking some medicines like clomiphene for the growth of your follicles and track your follicles growth by repeated ultrasound and when your follicles is more than 17 to 18 mm, take injection for rupturing the follicles.  Be in contact with your husband for 2 to 3 days after your periods stop.  Take progesterone for next 2 weeks.  Do a urine pregnancy test at home after that.

You need to know about the causes of dark lips to be taking precautions better.A lot of people have it genetically predetermined,although parents may/may not have it. A frequent cause of non genetic lip darkening is the use of lipsticks /coloured balms/gloss , as these tend to darken the lips over a period of time.So try and not use it too often..If you have to use it,then let it be allegen free and replace them every 2 months.I would advise you to start using medicated lip balms with SPF and to reapply it several times in a day..that helps in reducing further darkening. Depiwhite cream or any others having Kojic acid can be used twice a day for lightening of lip color. It usually does not have side effects. however u can check for tolerance of the product by applying it for a short time on the first application.If you have a genetic tendency to dark lips, the pigmentation has chances of coming bak after the cream is stopped. U can also opt for mild chemical peels once in 15-30 days to exfoliate better and lighten faster. Take care!"},{"Patient":"Hi , I m an 18 year old female.

You should immediately stop any further scratching it. You should get it removed by a plastic surgeon as they have the necessary expertise to remove it surgically with good cosmetic result. At the same time the removed mole should be checked up in the laboratory(Histo-pathology laboratory to be precise)to find out that whether it is benign or cancerous.

I used it for a day and it s effects are : light red colour on used area . It seems it acts like acid . Can you guide It s normal or it s not proper medicine . Thanks & Regard Rekha Email Address: YYYY@YYYY","Doctor":"Hi Rekha, It sounds like you have pigmentation, possibly melasma. Glycovira cream contains a substance called Glycolic acid, which is given for the treatment of pigmentation. However, you need to be careful while using it. Here are some of the precautions you need to take: 1. Do not use any kind of scrub on the face while you are on glycolic treatment 2. Avoid sun exposure, and use high SPF sunblock if you have to go out in the sun 3. Do not bleach, wax or use any aromatic oils on the area 4. Do not massage the glycolic cream. it just has to be applied gently. 5. Use the glyco cream only at night, never during day time. since you have erythema (light red colour) on the area where you have used the cream, discontinue it for a couple of days. Once skin returns to normal, use the glyco cream mixed with a gentle moisturizer or petroleum jelly. gradually reduce the quantity of moisturizer over a period of few days, as your skin gets used to the glycolic acid. Remember that rubbing the glyco cream on your skin, or applying it in excessive quantities is not going to give you faster results, and, in fact, might damage your skin. So use it as advised by your dermatologist. Hope this helps. Regards,"},{"Patient":"Is Niltan a creme that i can use for the rest of my life or there is a limit?

As you have pigmentation issues also, use a good sunscreen. To reduce pigmentation use a good sunscreen, take vitamin c and antioxidant supplements and use a demelanizing cream .

The peeling took a long process nearly 20 days, my skin is rough and dry and looks dull. my doctor says the peeling is incomplete and need to keep doing more.

Should i continue with more peels? Please suggest.","Doctor":"Hi , Thanks for writing in. The problem can be acanthosis nigricans,tanning etc. Without actual visualisation of the skin it is not possible to comment on nature of pigmentation. Sun protection is most important for any cosmetic treatment. Use good quality sunscreen. Avoid sun exposure. Use brevoxyl face wash. Apply Kojivit cream at night over dark spots.

In deep pitted scars, one needs to release the scars from their underling attachment with the help of needles called subcision and after that fill in the dead space so create with artificial fillers or fat to smooth out the surface.

Management of melasma can be challenging and requires long-term treatment with topical agents. The results are often unsatisfactory and topical agents may sometimes cause significant adverse reactions.

A triple combination of hydroquinone, retinoic acid, and corticosteroids has been suggested to be the first-line topical treatment for this pigmentary disorder and incidentally you ate undergoing the same triple combination treatment.

I've come around to the the placebo pills again (they started on Tuesday, May 24th) but I haven't gotten my period yet.  I'm worried I might be pregnant--what's your opinion?","Doctor":"Hello, Thank you for your query. It is possible to get pregnant while on birth control but the chances are very less (about 3%).*how long have you been on the pill? *did you start the pill as prescribed? *have you regarding periods so far? (before the pills) I recommend :-wait for Another week after the placebos are over. If no period, take a pregnancy test. If negative wait for Another week and see your OBGYN to check any hormonal imbalances or functional ovarian cysts (which are Benign) that could be causing the delay in periods. Some irregularities in menstrual cycle and flow is expected while starting the pill (about 3 months). This regulates over time. To answer your question specifically - no it is unlikely to get pregnant while on the placebos  if you have been taking  the pills regularly. The timing of the placebos coincides with the period after ovulation. Hence no fertilization can occur. Hope this helps. Please let me know if there is anything else I can help you with.

Thanks and Regards","Doctor":"Hello, Pigmentary alteration occurs in 25-70% of the dialysis population and increases over time. A multitude of uremia-related changes are responsible for the pigmentary alterations. Your hyperpigmentation is due to an increase in melanin production because of an increase in poorly dialyzable beta-melanocyte stimulating hormone. Frankly speaking there is no proper treatment for this hyper pigmentation and it has been observed that these dark pigmented patches get improved in those patients who receive kidney transplant. The best would be to discuss this with your treating nephrologist. Thanks"},{"Patient":"Hello. Half of my left eyebrow (hairs) turned to while.

Shaving causes hair to grow back thicker and darker, and this dark hair is often visible under transparent, light skin - which is what makes the skin look darker. Also, waxing removes dead skin, while shaving does not do the same. If you shave underarms regularly, you may want to scrub your underarm area with a pumice stone on a daily basis. This should help combat darkness to an extent. Apply lemon juice. Don't wear polyester clothing near those areas. Wash regularly, make sure these areas are dry by applying powder. Try Shower to Shower. Wax these areas regularly. If your inner thighs rub together this also causes it to go dark, so you may need to lose weight on your thighs. Stop using hair removal cream on your underarms and start waxing. Scrub your underarms daily with a pumice stone, after applying soap, while taking a shower. Take care."},{"Patient":"I have been using Flutivate for 13 years and my skin did not have as such any problem which I could notice accept that when I use to stop my skin use to become dry & use to seem as thought dry flakes coming off.

Can you suggest how can I get the pigmentation reduced. And, its urgent as this is impacting my personal life too & being HR I need to look good","Doctor":"Hi Priya, Firstly, to reduce dryness and skin flaking, use a good cleansing bar like cetaphil. Do not go for hot water baths as it dries the skin extensively instead use Luke warm water. Always dab your skin with towel instead of rubbing and apply a good moisturising lotion immediately after bath while the skin is still moist to lock in the moisture. Moisturising lotions (like cetaphil restoraderm or ureativ 10) or creams (like moisturex or cotaryl) are good to reduce dryness. Just wanted to mention these are the general recommendations to have a properly hydrated skin. You need to consult a good dermatologist to decide whether steroids are required or not as dermatology being a visual field proper consultation can only be given after analysing the skin. However what I have advised above would surely help you out in soothing your skin and preventing further darkening of skin.

Thanks for your query. Common causes for having dark pigmentation under the eye are: -Iron deficiency anemia -Stress, anxiety or depression -Lack of sleep, poor sleep hygiene -Poor water intake -Smoking and alcohol -Chronic illness -Unknown causes (idiopathic). So, it is important to identify specific and treatable cause for best result. In most of the cases reasons for having dark circles below eyes are multiple and that's why multimodal approach becomes necessary for the treatment. General treatment consists of: -Iron and B complex vitamins -Apply almond oil around eyes in night -Put slices of cucumber above your eyes daily for 15 minutes -For stress (if present): daily morning walk, meditation and yoga -Proper sleep for 7 to 8 hrs per day, follow sleep hygiene -Plenty of water, fresh fruits, vegetables and salads intake -Using sunscreens: if your skin is sensitive for sunlight If above steps failed (which is less likely), then you should visit dermatologist for treatment options like: Medicines, Chemical peeling and Laser treatment.

There is no known way to prevent or cure vitiligo. However, several methods, including cosmetics, re-pigmentation using UV light therapy, corticosteroid creams, depigmentation of unaffected skin areas, and skin grafting, can be used to improve the appearance of skin severely affected by vitiligo. and this is an eruptive stage in ur child where newer patches are coming really fast , later there comes a cycle of patches which become stable and newer patches reduce in number but increase in size. this is not to dishearten you dear, but if u continue with homeopathic treatment u may not find quick response as it is the nature of the disease but surely u may get fewer parches and with time they also can fade away in the long run. it is advisable to visit ur homoeopath once again to confirm with regarding the treatment through the constitutional medicine. also u can ask him for Ammi Visnaga tincture, if u apply the medicine on those spots and make ur son sit under sun rays for 10-15 minutes daily it will give you good result.

As i always say, sadly dermatology is a visual field & as such, it is best to visit a dermatologist (second one for another opinion) near you.

The treatment can also involve an oral medication (has to be taken with a prescription) of fluconazole 400mg as a single dose & topical ketoconazole cream.

I stoped the pills 2 years ago and been trying since then and nothing happened. We went to the Dr 2 months ago and he did the sperm test and the result said it was really low. My ovulation was last week and we had sex during my ovulation day on the13th. I am expecting my mestruation on the 27th I am very regular. On the 18th and 19th I bled a little but it was not like the mestruation, it was a light red, pinkish color and i didn't need to use any tampon or anything because the bleeding was just when i pee. I feel some crams in my belly just like if it was the mestruation but it's not suposed to come until the 27th. I was wondering if it is the impantation bleeding. I took a pregnancy test but it came out negative. I don't if it's too soon for the pregnancy test. I was thinking about taking a blood test but maybe i should wait for the mestruation. Can you help me to figure this out please?","Doctor":"Hi there, I have understood your concern. I will suggest you the best possible treatment options. You are on right track for getting pregnant.  As you might be aware that if you get pregnant on or around the day of ovulation, it takes 7 days for the pregnancy to get implanted in the uterus. Some women can get slight bright red bleeding on that day, which is referred to as implantation bleeding. I will suggest you to wait at least 15 to 20 days after your day of ovulation, or wait till 27th February, which is your expected date of the cycle. If you happen to cross your dates, then please get morning's first sample of urine tested for pregnancy. In case of doubt blood beta HCG test and USG will be of help . Doing it earlier can not be conclusive.Also, I will suggest you to start with Folic acid, Vitamin B 12 and Omega 3 supplements at least 3 months before you plan to to get pregnant . This helps to prevent many problems during pregnancy and delivery. I hope this answer helps you. Thanks.

As you have used it for such a prolonged period, abrupt stoppage can lead to rebound hyperpigmentation. So what you need to do is to taper down its use.

Freckles are clusters of concentrated melanin which are often visible in fair skin people. It is genetic in origin. Formation of freckles is triggered by sunlight. So it is not related to weather . It is basically the exposure to sunlight that means exposure to UV B light that activates the melanocytes to increase melanin production which makes freckles darker & make them more visible.

So the treatment can only be prescribed after analysing your face. However in general for facial pigmentation, the preventive measures that you should follow are- 1) Avoid sun sxposure, use a sunscreen of Spf more than 30 even if staying indoors 2) take a vitamin c supplement and antioxidant supplement on daily basis 3) dont use fragrant creams or cosmetics over your face Avoid applying creams without doctor's prescription, melacare as such is a good cream however long term use and sudden withdrawal can lead to rebound hyperpigmentation, thin dry irritated skin etc. Take care."},{"Patient":"Sir, My Face often had pimples/ acne .

To treat the same, i hope you discontinued using that particular dye. Secondly use a good sunscreen along with oral antioxidant and vitamin c tablets. Also prime your skin with good depigmenting agents like glycolic acid cream or triple combination(hydroquinone, tretinoin, steroid) creams. Peels like glycolic acid or trichloroacetic acid  can be used to lighten the pigmentation. As you have already taken peels with not much effect, is essential to know what was the concentration of peels used. You can also go with mesotherapy sessions  with vitamin c and glutathione along with peels to lighten your pigmentation. Lastly if nothing works, discuss the option of q switched nd yag lasers with your doctor as they yield good results in stubborn pigmentation.

The first one is associated with blood pressure changes,variable heart rate, weight loss nausea vomiting and skin pigmentation. The diagnosis can be made with serum cortisol, serum sodium and serum potassium levels. Acanthosis can either be solitary occurrence or might be associated with Pcod where in excessive hair growth and irregular periods are associated and it can be ruled out with pelvic ultrasound and hormonal tests. As you haven't mentioned any other complaints,I presume you are having acanthosis. It can be treated to some extent with creams containing tretinoinor glycolic acid or hydro quinine with tretinoin and steroids.Glycolic acid, TCA peels can be used at some areas. A good emollient is also required to keep the skin supple. Lasers and microdermabrasion can also be tried.

Pls advise what other care I should take.","Doctor":"Hi there Zeno. Being a Dermatologist this seems up my street. However, from your description, i seem to concur with the other dermatologists' opinion in that it does appear to be 'Schamberg's disease'. The pigmentation arises largely due to 'hemosiderin' deposits & increases over a period of time. That is the underlying pathology but the pathogenesis itself appears unclear hence the remedies too are similar. Both Vit C & Vit K are powerful antoxidants & recommended for this virtue in your case. I presume you wear the 'medical socks' on account of varicosities? Please do upload some clear photographs of both your lower limbs on this portal for a more holistic advice or consult with us using the premier package. They are right..harmless it most certainly is but 'unsightly' especially for a woman. I did have a male doctor as a patient this morning with a similar issue. I always recommend sleeping with the 'foot-end' of the bed raised & try to sit with your feet up & avoid standing for long periods..all general measures for improving the venous drainage of the area & limiting the damage. Use of a topical skin lightening cream may be useful & some of us dermatologists' push for laser treatments but have not found them to be of much use..perhaps lighten the skin to an extent.

Yes, during pregnancy many women get these dark spots on their face. These are called melasma or chloasma which are really stubborn. Since it is almost three years since you have them it may take time to go away. These marks are also caused due to oral-contraceptive pills that most women use to plan their family. ( it is a side effect that effects some women not all ) I will suggest you not to take these pills and use barrier methods to avoid pregnancy. You should take plenty of water, juice and soups to keep yourself well hydrated. Include dietary supplements or take food and fruits rich in vitamin B, C, E. Reduce the tea and coffee intake. You can apply natural papaya ( yellow) pulp as a face mask for 20 minutes regularly, it is very effective. You can also apply lemon juice which is a bleaching agent. Do not use strong cosmetics. Laser therapy shows very good results. You can consult a dermatologist who is an expert in giving laser therapy. First check whether your sensitive skin can take the therapy. If yes, go for it and you will get the result. It can help you look very fair. Have a good day, take care."},{"Patient":"Hello Doctor...I am a 23yr old gal with fair complexion .

It is increasing in number because you have been neglecting it since a year. You have sensitive skin. Skin discolorations and patches take time to return back to normal. They took almost a year to seek your attention so just have a little patience they will go away gradually. You should firstly take heed to what you eat. You should increase your dietary intake of vitamin B and E. You can even take nutritional supplements containing vitamins and minerals. Keep yourself well hydrated. Take 1-2 liters of water each day, plenty of  fruits, juice and soups. Add cereals, legumes and dairy products in your diet. You do have the option to consult a dermatologist.The patches and discoloration can be because of some allergy. You need to investigate and see what are the things around you like pollen, pet animals, allergy causing plants and foods to which your skin is sensitive and reacts adversely. Just stay away from them.  It can also be due to sun burn, reaction to some type of jewellery, fur or leather. It can also be due to some bugs in your room or wardrobe. Just check it out.Take bath with a medicated soap regularly. You can apply a good quality moisturiser. ( herbal will be better than a chemical product ).  You can consult a beauty expert to exactly know your skin type ( normal, oily, dry ) to apply the best product applicable for you. You can enquire about a good body pack that will be helpful to reduce the patches ( turmeric and ayurvedic based ones are good) . Do not forget to put a branded sun-screen lotion when you are outdoors. Take vitamin E supplements for better effects.

You did say you have met 7 dermatologists'..am surprised you still count :) We are not a very large group in the medical fraternity but am sorry we have not been of mch help thus far...am sure they will have tried. Your problem my dear will require a more in-depth assessment. First, one needs to know the 'depth' of your pigmentation..superficial, epidermal or deeper dermal? A wood's lamp examination will be useful to help out or a dermascope or nowadays, facial scanners with IR etc give you a 'map' of your face. Next, underlying hormonal or endocrine causes need to be ruled out. Then accordingly a treatment regime needs to be started that varies from creams to lasers depending on your case.

As soon as you get any infection( be it any infection disease you think of - Typhoid , TB , Hepatitis etc)  your body produces IgM & over time your body produces IgG, which means that some time in the past you had the infection, it is not active . So whats the meaning of taking antibiotics for some infection , which is dead & gone & has just left back few antibodies.I do agree that CMV during infection can cause irreversible anomalies in baby , needing abortion, but it is never a cause of recurrent abortion.

Hyper-pigmentation can result from excessive sun exposure, use sunscreen with SPF 30. Some natural remedies are- mixture of lemon juice and cream; apply on face. Put lemon juice onto basil leaves. This is great for getting rid of pigmentation marks and dark circles that may have been a long-time problem. Apply lime (nimbu) to the affected area, and after 15 minutes wash it off. This needs to be done on a daily basis. Other remedy is Kojic acid cream which lightens up the dark spots but takes some time. However, mesoglow is a facial treatment using Vitamins and Mineral injections to add that healthy glow to skin which radiates energy and vitality.Subdermal vitamin injections rejuvenate the cells, making them more active and thereby stimulating the production of collagen and elastin. Overall it reduces dark spots; effects seen faster than kojic acid. You can continue same treatment for dark spots along with natural remedies and sunscreen creams. Take care.

Topical application of a steroid cream or a tacrolimus ointment on the spots will help stop the activity as well Thanks"},{"Patient":"I was in hospital at the end of January excessive bleeding & clotting .. tests done all clear and was advised to have implanon implant out ASAP which I did.. Weeks following I had unprotected sex with my new partner & still have not had a period although I had pregnancy urine & blood tests done over 2 weeks ago which proved negative? Could I still be pregnant and should I do another urine test? Thank you.. .. never mind I will see my GP again who bulk bills my account & try & find out what is going on..","Doctor":"Hi there, I have understood your concern. I will suggest you the best possible treatment options. 1 ) First of all do not panic. 2 ) I will suggest you to get morning's first sample of urine tested for pregnancy, at least 15 to 20 days after your last episode of unprotected sex act. In case of doubt blood beta HCG test and USG will be of help. Tests done earlier than this period may not give predictable results. 3 ) If you are not pregnant then you can simply wait for the onset of periods or induce the periods with progesterone tablets. Your treating doctor can guide you further about it. 4 ) Even If you are pregnant, you can opt for termination of the pregnancy with medicines safely till 9 weeks of pregnancy under medical supervision.

Normal skin contains cells called melanocytes. These cells produce melanin, the substance that gives skin its color. Causes of hyperpigmentation include: •  History of skin inflammation (post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation) •  Use of certain medications (such as minocycline) •  Endocrine diseases such as Addison's disease •  Hemochromatosis (iron overload) •  Sun exposure Over-the-counter creams are available for lightening the skin. If you use these creams, follow instructions carefully and don't use one for more than 3 weeks at a time. Darker skin requires greater care when using these preparations. Cosmetics may also help cover a discoloration. Avoid too much sun exposure. Always use sunscreen. Abnormally dark skin may continue even after treatment. Experts recommend emotional support or counseling. Most prescription creams used to lighten the skin contain hydroquinone. Bleaches lighten and fade darkened skin patches by slowing the production of melanin so those dark spots gradually fade to match normal skin coloration. Prescription bleaches contain twice the amount of hydroquinone, the active ingredient, as over-the-counter skin bleaches. In more severe cases prescription creams with tretinoin and a cortisone cream may be used. These may be somewhat irritating to sensitive skin and will take 3-6 months to produce improvement. Home care of your condition with yogurt fruit peels may have some benefit for freckling of the skin.  If you have large areas of hyperpigmentation, this may not assist you.  You may try these products yourself within your home without the assistance of a dermatologist.  Be sure to inform your dermatologist of the products you are using.  Do not use several products at the same time.  If you purchase any creams for lightening of your hyperpigmentation, ensure that no mercury is in the product. Sun exposure will make your condition worse.  Use a sunscreen that blocks both UV-A and UV-B rays. Be well, Dr. Kimberly"},{"Patient":"i want to have very chubby cheeks and fat hands. what should i do ?

Hyperpigmentation can occur due to a variety of causes like endocrine disturbances, exposure to sunlight, drugs like antibiotics, antiarrhythmics, and antimalaria drugs and in post inflammatory states. There are a few things that I would like to clarify here. First of all, the sunscreen that you are using should have a 50-60 SPF and should cover both UVA and UVB. This needs to be applied 20 minutes before stepping out and every 2 hours thereafter. Further, you should also use an umbrella. Other drugs which are used for treating hyperpigmentation include creams which contain tretinoin, azelaic acid and  hydroquinone. Procedures like glycolic acid peels are also used sometimes.

These creams  either contain hydroquinone, tretinoin, steroids ,glycolic acid or kojic acid . One can even go for chemical peels from a dermatologist at regular intervals.

Women with a light brown skin type with intense sun exposure are particularly susceptible to developing this condition.Since there is no cream that can be suggested you can consult a Dermatologist and discuss the option of peeling of the skin which should help to a certain extent.Kindly follow up with a Dermatologist.

I am not on contraceptives either. Please help You answer doesnt help since diagnosis might be wrong. Please note I dont have a baby yet nor I am on contraceptive... nope nothing wrong with me in this area, its just that I just got married","Doctor":"Hi!, Welcome to HealthcareMagic forum, According to your history ,it seems that you have MELASMA,since you quoted that you are not on oral contraceptive pills and you have not  had any issues either.These questions you would have faced by many doctors . It is true that such pigmentation is often seen after pregnancy or one who is on OCPs.But we have been seeing such pigmentation on those who have not had such a history either.So,even if you never had a baby ,one can have such pigmentation problem ,just because of slight shift in the hormones in the body.It is the estrogen level in the blood which is more responsible for such pigmentation. If this is melasma,we are dealing with a very chronic problem.It can wax and vain also.Sunlight & stress also has a big role to play. The best advise here would be to use a triple combination cream to begin with ,and then gradually taper it off.Don't use it for more than 2 weeks .As you taper it gradually start using hydroquinone based cream at night .Along with this also start using kojic acid & vit c based creams in day and evening.But please don't forget to use a good spf sunscreen daily  thrice.Sunscreen is mandatory. You can even under go chemical peeling from a experienced dermatologist. Results of this all might vary from patient to patient. Now being a laser expert I've myself done number of cases with lasers too.The best of the laser for this is Q-switched Nd:yag laser .But one cannot guarantee you any great results with this either.The results are variable here too.And its costly also. Melasma has always been a very frustrating problem both for the patient and the treating doctor.It is one thing which can destroy the reputation of most reputed doctor. So,have patience and kindly consult a dermatologist for this .Please do not take any beauty parlor treatment for this . This is one possibility what came in my mind. Secondly it might be freckles too since you said you have spots all over your face.Lasers is best for treating freckles .You may require only one sitting for this. Kindly consult a experienced dermatologist who can diagnose and treat your problem. I hope this answers your query,if you any further questions,kindly write back to us. regards, Dr.Bharat chawda"},{"Patient":"I have a chronic pigmentation on my skin .

Biopsy is not required unless it is doubtful to make diagnosis. You may be having associated hormonal problem due to ovarian cyst or other causes.

If your lips are dark, due to genetic factors, there are less chances to enhance the color.But if the color has changed due to environmental factors, you can go ahead and follow the below practices. 1. Keep your lips hydrated, and moisturized. 2. Use of natural moisturizing agents like honey helps to a large extent. 3. Take complete diet with high vitamin and mineral content. This keeps your skin healthy and in turn your lips. 4. Take additional precautions while using cosmetics. They have adverse effect on skin. 5.

It started above my upper lip area and is now around the upper cheeks and spots around lower cheeks. Ive used every atopic treatment that the dermatologists and plastic surgeons have given me. I ve spent lots of money on laser treatments at the Epiclinic in Adelaide as well as at the Medical laser clinic. I ve even gone off the pill in attempt to get ride of this depressing skin disorder , only off for 2 months as I had developed other problems with the skin( i.e) acney over the chest area. I have one blood test and in the process of another tomorrow as I requested the Dr to check my Thyroid Function again and Hormone levels. I do know only that my cholesterol was up alittle last test and have been very dilligent in exercising and detoxing and eating right. I am not over weight and have been told I look great. Its a genetic thing this high cholesterol , however I m still taking it seriously. I dont like not taking Dianne 35 (the pill) as I experience irregular periods and cystic breakouts on chest and some on my face when I dont take it.Hence why I ve asked for the hormone tests etc. I have been on the internet recently and have read alittle about Addisons scleroderma . I may be clutching at straws but experiencing frequency and dehyration mood swings,fatigue ,back aches and stomach upsets also faint when standing from a lying position. My blood pressure has always been normal to low . I ve had an ultrasound and they only found a 2.5cm cyst in right kidney. I dont think this is causing the freqency so I put it down to nervous tension and anxiety which I experience from time to time or pelvic floor weakness and went to see a pelvic floor Dr. After reading about addison scleraderma Im leaning more and more in its favour. What test do I NEED tO ASK MY DR FOR? She is not that cluey and I need to prompt her every step of the way. My dermatologist has given me another hydoquinone mixture to apply alternatively with Kojic acid cream which i know isnt going to work.It lightens it by peeling affect but comes back in colour over time again. Also suggested changing the pill over to Yaz to try something different.The thing is up until 5-6 years ago the Dianne 35 pill was my best friend and fixed everything. My skin is olive in complection and as been discribed as type 3. I ve had dermabrations and laser hair removal of the face in the past which I thought triggered the whole thing in the first place. Drs are saying it s partly hormonal,age and skin type, sun exposure, pregnancy etc.I didnt have the pigmentato during pregnancy and I have been very careful to always apply sun screen and always wear a hat when in the garden or in the sun. I ve always tanned easily and still do without trying. My skin problems truely started in my early 20s with adult acney. I don t have scaring and consider myself lucky to miss the adolescent brakeouts everyone else had at the time but am sure paying for it with this other problem.

She has pimples on face, back and chest from the age of 12, and we have tried all sorts of medicines, but of no use. Could you please advice.","Doctor":"Hi!madhura.jois, Welcome To HealthcareMagic forum, Pimples  are multi factorial, with reasons ranging from wrong selection  of creams and soaps to internal hormonal disturbances(esp in females).She  should avoid all oily stuff on her  face right from oily soaps to moisturizing creams. If your daughter has any  problem in her periods or her acne  aggravates 2 days prior to her periods ,then you should get a hormonal profile done with a ultrasound of lower abdomen. If some  thing comes positive then she needs a hormonal treatment along with a anti acne treatment This would mean that her acne is because of her raised hormones. If not then you have two options –either oral retinoids(for sever acne) or oral antibiotics depending upon the severity. They need to be taken for long .Also use a good anti acne soap daily. Its mandatory to use anti acne creams like nadifloxacin or clindamycin  cream.Oral Retinoid is a wonder drug for acne but before taking one should discuss all the precautions and side effects of it.(esp in females). All these require a medical prescription and you should show to a dermatologist   for this.Drink plenty of water and take a god 7 hr sleep in night .Never squeeze your pimples or else they would leave marks. Acne is 100% curable if you take a good line of treatment.

You need to lessen sun exposure. Use daily facewash like Clearasil which is very good in removing blocked skin pores like whiteheads and also blackheads. Secret to great skin is to drink plenty of water and eat plenty of fresh fruits and green leafy vegetables. Brisk walking for 40 minutes a day does wonders to skin because sweating opens skin pores and prevents excess oil accumulation naturally. Avoid fried food, junk food, oily food which is a cause for bad skin in such situation. Avoid stress which can also make skin oily. Do Yoga, Pranayam and deep breathing exercises to help you relax. Get 6-8 hours of sleep a day. Mild skin massage with fingers also improves blood circulation to the skin and good skin health. Avoid using cosmetics. You can use sun screen SPF25 to prevent UV light induced skin damage from the sun. The spots can be shown to Dermatologist as there is effective way to remove them by special creams containing hydroquinone which is skin bleaching agent.

But fortunately this is a temporary condition ,it will go off after few weeks on its own. But if you want a faster recovery then you can use any mild steroid cream in combination with a hydroquionone cream at night over the spot.In the morning don't forget to use a good sunscreen three times a day.

But you can't conceive while using this medicine. So, you can take ovral for 3 months and then stop it if you want pregnancy. The problem in pcod is ovulation, so you can track your follicles growth by repeated ultrasound and see if rupture of follicles is occurring or not. If your follicles are not growing or not rupturing, then you have to take medicines like clomiphene for that. Discuss with your doctor regarding this.  The headache , dizziness and nausea are side effects of ovral.  So don't worry about it.  Have a healthy diet.  You can do any type of weight reducing exercises, brisk walking can be one of them.

Look like moles? Hi there, I am a 29 year old female and I am breaking out in what I think are moles, all over and over night. Everyday I see new spots. I went to my doctor because I was concerned since about 3 weeks ago I started getting tiny red blood spots on my skin also/ these look like a tiny drop of blood under my skin. He did not know what they were and ordered no blood testing. Still concerned I went to the ER and they did blood work which they said was fine. I think a CBC was done. Anyway while looking for the more little red dots everyday I started to notice that I was getting brown spot also. I took pictures of my skin to be sure that I was not imaging things and sure enough each day new spots appeared. I started to remember a funny mole on the bottom of my foot and one in the crack of my butt which I though was a pimple that never went away. Husband said it was a mole. So I go back to the doctor and let him see my pictures and show him the ugly moles/ He was concerned about the one on my back side so sent me to a dermatologist . I was seen there the next day, he looked me over and looked at the one on my butt and foot. He told me the one on my butt needed to be looked at once every six months but other then that I looked good. He did not testing and never offered an explanation on why these spots are coming up, I will admitt I was a bit anxious having looked these up on the internet so maybe he just thought I was being overly concerned I am not sure/ This is really worrying me.

You don't mention that you suffer from any other related symptoms. But frequency can often be associated with 'urgency' (a sudden need to pass urine) and difficulty in controlling the bladder to the degree that one may be incontinent. If you are troubled by these symptoms then I would recommend that you seek help from your GP or practice nurse. The bladder is emptied via the urethra by contraction of the normally relaxed 'detrusor' muscle that constitutes the wall of the bladder. Lower urinary tract symptoms such as problems with frequency, urgency and getting up at night to pass urine are commonly related to an irritative bladder muscle (also known as detrusor instability). An unstable detrusor also contracts in between voidings. This causes high pressures in the bladder that may be felt as urgency and give rise to urine leakage. Rarely a deficiency of the hormone which controls the body's water balance can result in urinary frequency and thirst. This is unlikely in your case because of the length of time you've had your symptoms but again it is something your doctor can investigate. thanks for using HCM forum"},{"Patient":"Hi, I had an abortion about 5 months ago...my boyfriend and I have been trying to conceive for a couple months now and I have been tracking my ovulation. and sadly each months i have not concieved..i had the pill abortion, could there have been complications tha may have scared me? with my last period i did pas another big clot..should i possibly of had a d&c","Doctor":"Hi, I think your abortion will not have any effect on your conception. Generally it takes 1 year of trying to get pregnant in a normal couple. So, just follow your ovulation.  Be in contact with your husband every 2 to 3 days after your periods stop.  It will increase chances of your pregnancy.  Hope I have answered your question.

Skin pigmentation disorders are conditions that cause the skin to appear lighter or darker than normal, or blotchy and discolored.n hyperpigmentation, the body produces too much melanin, causing skin to become darker than usual. Lichen simplex chronicus is a skin disorder with severe itching that causes thick, dark patches of skin to develop. Lamellar ichthyosis (fish scale disease) is an inherited disease that also is characterized by darkened, scaly, dry patches of skin. Diagnostic tests vary for different types of skin pigmentation disorders. Physicians usually can diagnose albinism by looking carefully at a person's hair, skin, and eyes. They may order blood tests and eye exams as well. A visual exam also is enough to diagnose vitilgo.

It is a combination of three things (steroid,tretinoin & hydroquinone).Its the steroid component which leads to all the side effects.I am sure if it was prescribed by a dermatologist he would have told you not to use it for long. If used for long it can cause pimples,rosacea(redness) ,fine lines on face ,capillary out breaks  etc.The moment you stop using this cream ,it leads to itching & burning sensation with redness.pimples is a major side effect. If you continue to use this cream its going to cause all the above problems.So stop this cream asap. Once you leave  this cream you are going to get with-drawl effects of this cream as described above( they are same as you use it for long). It takes along to get over it .There are creams like tacrolimus or pimecrolimus which would help you recover from this.In case of pimples I prefer oral retinoids if pimples are sever.And always use a sunscreen while going out.

Similarly we can 3 such cycles .In resistant cases even oral retinoids can be tried .But for that you should consult a good dermatologist .Also before giving retinoids one needs to undergo certain blood investigations and take specific precaution (esp in females).So discuss the possibility of retinoids with your treating doctor.Its a excellent tablet for pimples ,but works good for pigmentation too. If you are using skinlite over exposed areas of body then don't forget to use a good spf sunscreen in day time. I hope this answers your question ,if you have any further query you can write back to us. regards, Dr.chawda"},{"Patient":"hello ive got a three month old daughter an she has had some dark patches appear on her body she has 16 in total she did\`nt have them when she was born ive been reading on here and the marks look a little like neurofibromatoiss, please could you give me some help","Doctor":"this do\`nt tell me anything about what i asked"},{"Patient":"what is the disease where you have a fungus eating your melanin from your skin?","Doctor":"Hi!, Welcome To HealthcareMagic forum, Fungus eating your melanin is called TINEA VERSICOLOR.This is most commonly seen over chest,back and arms.Versicolor basically means variable color and the most common color seen is hypo-pigmented color.

We can understand the changes in your sister's skin can result in stress and worries about the appearance. Vitiligo is a condition in which your skin loses melanin, the pigment that determines the color of your skin, hair and eyes. Vitiligo occurs when the cells that produce melanin die or no longer form melanin causing slowly enlarging white patches of irregular shapes to appear on your skin. The goal of treatment is to stop or slow the progression of pigment loss and, if you desire, attempt to return some color to your skin.    The latest advances are included at this link which includes Psoralen, PUVA and Narrow band Ultra Violet.  . If the patches are small the distressing color can be camouflaged with melanocyte transfer and re growing the skin over it. Lot of research is pending in the treatment but yet there is no complete cure for vitiligo at treating the cause.    We can help you getting the Grafting over patches or Melanocyte Transfer procedures and re-growing the skin done if you are in Bangalore or take time to get it done here."},{"Patient":"hi iv been married for 6 years now n hav a 5 yr old child. we are trying for the other but havnt been succesful from the past two years. my doctor has now put me on akt3 though i even went for endometriosis. the test was negative. still she wants me to continue it for 6 weeks. will it be helpful. i have a shaggy uterus","Doctor":"Hi.The AKT-3 kit is for treatment of tuberculosis (TB), and I advise not to try and conceive whilst on the AKT-3 treatment and for a while after until the impact of the infection subsides.

I am based out of Rohini and looking for a clinic around this place. Thanks in advance for your suggestions.Warm regards,Anupam","Doctor":"Hello, Psoriasis presents as well defined, thick scaly plaques mainly involving the scalp, ans extensor surfaces like elbow, knee, lower back etc. Unlike extensive psoriatic disease for which both oral and topical treatment is required, for limited disease topical treatment alone is effective. However, for extensive disease systemic treatment with oral immunosuppresives like methotrexate, cyclosporin, Phototherapy (PUVA), Biologics etc may be required for disease control. Specific topical treatment options for psoriatic plaques are topical steroid with or without salicylic acid, topical Vitamin D analogs like calcipotriol, calcipotriene etc. These are available in ointment form for plaques involving the body and in lotion form for scalp psoriasis. Topical therapy may be combined with oral/systemic therapy for widespread/extensive disease. Besides specific remedies for psoriasis, moisturizers form an important part in the management of psoriasis because of the thick scaly nature of the plaques. Moisturizers enhance the penetration of topical active ingredients as well as prevents or delays side effects like skin atrophy etc. An oral antihistamine e.g cetrizine 10 mg may be required for symptomatic relief from itching. Treatment may take 2-4 weeks to show noticeable improvement. Therefore, I would suggest him to continue with the prescribed medicines and follow up with his doctor every 2-4 weeks.

Get physically examined with the biopsy test. Do continue to take the steroids and creams prescribed. You may require oral or injected medications like Methotrexate, Cyclosporine or medications that alter immune response under a PCP. Other treatments are UVB phototherapy, Goeckerman phototherapy, laser therapy, etc. after evaluating disease you have. Eczema is not a contagious disease, it causes patchy dry skin that is itchy, scaly and thickened. There is no permanent cure for eczema but it can be controlled by treating damaged skin. Topical corticosteroid creams and ointments, antibiotics along with antivirals are effective. Phototherapy also works well. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further.

INDICATION: chronic sinusitis . Sleep apnea. COMPARISON: CT neck October 7, 2013. ENCOUNTER: Not applicable FINDINGS: There is minimal biconvex deviation of the nasal septum without osseous spur. There are no nasal polyps. A prominent concha bullosa formation is noted in the right middle nasal turbinate with paradoxical configuration of the smaller left middle nasal turbinate. There is narrowing of both the middle meatus and infundibula on the right as well as mild narrowing of the infundibulum on the left. Haller cell formation contributes to narrowing of the left infundibula. There is a prominent well-circumscribed mass which occupies approximately two thirds of the volume of the right maxillary sinus. This likely represents a retention cyst and is not significantly altered in appearance compared to the CT examination of October 7, 2013. A similar finding is noted at the base of the left maxillary sinus. This is considerably smaller than noted on the prior CT examination of October 7, 2013. The frontal sinuses and frontal recesses are well-aerated as are the ethmoid sinuses. The sphenoid sinuses and sphenoethmoidal recesses are also aerated. Negative for bone destruction skull base. The orbits demonstrate a normal appearance. The mastoid air cells and middle ears are well-aerated. There is prominent soft tissue in the nasopharynx likely representing hypertrophic adenoidal tissue. IMPRESSION: 1. Minimal nasal septal deviation. There are no nasal polyps. There is narrowing of the ostiomeatal complex on the right and a lesser degree narrowing of the infundibula of the left ostiomeatal complex. 2. Mass lesions present in the maxillary sinuses bilaterally. There are most consistent with retention cysts. That on the right side is stable compared to the prior CT examination of October 7, 2013 while the left sided lesion is considerably decreased in volume compared to the prior study.","Doctor":"Hello, I recommend you to post the question to an ENT Physician (Otorhinolaryngologist).Hope I have answered your query.

D.K.Jain","Doctor":"Thank you for your question!!Psoriasis is a chronic inflammatory skin disease, which remits spontaneously in 1/3 of patients, but the course is not predictable. It can be controlled rather than cured, and you can keep it in control but with a careful avoidance of trigger factors that can exacerbate it, also with the continuous use of medications.Allegra tab is fexofenadine an antihistamine to suppress pruritus. Mega 3 are omega 3 oral supplements which showed some degree of improvement in psoriasis lesions. Aquasol A capsules are vitamin A supplements which also help with psoriasis.How long are you on these medications? Have you noticed improvement?Are your lesions localized or generalized?Anyway I would like to give you some recommendations and general principles how to control the disease.I am not aiming to get rid of the psoriasis, but to make the condition tolerable.Try to avoid the factors that exacerbate psoriasis such as: Infections (tonsillitis, pharyngitis), trauma to the skin, stress or emotional upset, some drugs such as beta blockers, lithium etc.You can use the medicines you are taking, except Allegra tab unless you have pruritus.If a patient the same with your situation would meet my clinic, I would suggest to move to some topical preparations such as Vitamin D3 analogues (calcipotriol) applied 2 times daily for 3 months, also a topical cortiocosteroid cream applied twice a day also for 2-3 weeks. You can also mix these two together and apply them. You should talk to your doctor about prescribed medications.It is crucial that you use moisturisers 3 times daily, and if the situation is not under control your physician can advice you about systemic treatment.Be careful to do the screening before starting a systemic treatment.I hope this helps.

I am Elizabeth Lee, from Malaysia. I have been suffering from psoriasis since I was 23 years old. Now, I am 34 years old. My psoriasis have been ups and down. But then its still manageable. But things turn differently, after my delivery of my baby since January 2010. My psoriasis have flared up so much that it covers 85% of my body, especially both my legs. I have seen many doctors, and even skins specialists. But then my psoriasis has not settled or remained the same severe. I had used 707 Oil, from India, by an Aryuvedic practitioner. And taken some oral Aryuvedic pills , Dermaflex, from India. But then my psoriasis has not improved. Now, after 4 months after my delivery, my skin has noit gotten any better, even though I have applied medication given by skin specialist. Any alternative medication?? Please help.","Doctor":"Thank you for writing to HCM.Psoriasis is really kashtsadhya to asadhya classification disease. You are advised to undergo Panchkarma at some good ayurveda hospital near you.

Thank you for writing to usI suggest a likely possibility of fungal infection/ intertrigo Or it could also be intertriginous psoriasis considering that you have a history of psoriasis.Body folds like sub-mammary area, groin etc trap moisture and warmth and therefore provide an Ideal environment for the fungus to grow.Psoriasis too can affect body folds and presents as bright red patches with lot of itching and burning sensation. If I was the treating doctor I would have started you empirically on a topical antifungal+steroid combination cream e.g clotrimazole 1%+beclomethasone dipropionate 0.025% cream, twice daily.The steroid part would take care of the inflammation i.e itching and redness whereas the fungal part would help control the fungus.Moreover intertriginous psoriasis is a steroid responsive condition and topical steroids are drugs of choice for intertriginous psoriasis.Since the affected area is quite large therefore I would also suggest an oral antifungal e.g fluconazole.An OTC oral antihistamine e.g cetrizine 10 mg once daily will provide you symptomatic relief from itching.Topical and oral antifungals need to be continued for 4-6 weeks.Regards"},{"Patient":"Hello Dr., My 29 year old nephew  has  severe psoriasis, 80 % of body.

Thank you for writing to us.Light therapy (commonly NB-UV B phototherapy) is one of the systemic treatment options for widespread plaque psoriasis.Phototherapy may be used either alone Or more commonly it is combined with other oral/ systemic treatment options like biologics, methotrexate and oral retinoids e.g acitretin.Phototherapy sessions are usually administered thrice weekly and may take from 20-25 sessions to produce noticeable improvement.Phototherapy is safe and is not associated with side effects like immunosuppression or increased risk of infection in contrast to other systemic treatment options like biologics, methotrexate etc.Moreover since psoriasis can recur therefore it is always better to have a treatment modality which is not only effective but is also going to be safe over the long run.I suggest you to discuss more about phototherapy with his treating dermatologist.Besides topical treatment with emollients, topical steroids and topical vitamin D analogues like calcitriol/ calcipotriol etc are a useful adjunct to systemic treatment for psoriasis.Horse milk is not an approved treatment for psoriasis and therefore I am not in favor of it.Regards"},{"Patient":"i had fun with my girl friend not a complete sex just touched my penis to her vagina some movements..... she told that she didnt get her periods its already one day late ..!! does it means she is pregnant..? what to do if she come pregnant..!?? could you please help us with this the more problematic issue it ,ight atleast take 2 years to get married with her..?? please help with this problem sir/madam..","Doctor":"Hi.No, if there was no penetration art all, then there is nothing to worry about at all.

Significant improvement is usually noticeable within 2-4 weeks.Besides topical steroid lotions topical Vitamin D analogues e.g calcitriol/ calcipotriol lotions is also an effective treatment modality in scalp psoriasis, being antiinflammatory in action as well as normalizing abnormal epidermal hyperproliferation.Coal tar+salicylic based shampoo is also of immense benefit in scalp psoriasis.Coal tar is anti-inflammatory as well as anti-proliferative in action thus normalizing epidermal hyperproliferation.Salicylic acid is keratolytic and helps exfoliate thick scaling that usually accompanies psoriasis.These are prescription medications and therefore I suggest that you visit a specialist in your vicinity for the needful.Regards"},{"Patient":"Hi, i suffer with psoriasis, usually outbreaks are rare, but usually it follows a pattern first I will get it on my ankle, then my lower back then foreskin and other genital areas, then it will go.

Thanks for writing to us at healthcaremagicI will keep a possibility of palmoplantar keratoderma.This condition is due to extreme dryness of the skin of the palms and soles, manifesting as cracking and fissuring.The condition is more commonly seen in atopics; those who already have an underlying dry skin.Frequent washing with soaps exacerbates the condition further. Therefore, soaps and detergent use should be restricted to the minimum.Urea and ammonium lactate based moisturizers are quite good for extremely dry and cracked, fissured skin in this condition. They are keratolytics i.e exfoliate dead skin. They also trap moisture from the atmosphere and lock it into the skin(hygroscopic agents)Apart from using moisturizers, I also usually recommend my patients to use a potent topical steroid e.g clobetasol propionate, twice daily.Steroids are antinflammatory and help heal the cracks and fissures faster along with moisturizers.The condition may recur. Regular use of a moisturizer frequently and each time after hand washing is recommended.Skin biopsy would be able to reveal whether it is psoriasis.Regards"},{"Patient":"Hi, I have been suffering from Psoriasis for the past 15 years- most acute on my legs- though seasonal.

Thank you for writing to us at healthcaremagicSince you seem to have a generalized involvement with psoriasis; this type of involvement is also known as erythrodermic psoriasis Or unstable psoriasis.This type of psoriatic involvement is associated with thermoregulatory as well as metabolic complications as a result of the lack of normal temperature regulatory functions of the skin as well as loss of proteins, and fluids from the skin.In general unstable forms of psoriasis like erythrodermic, pustular psoriasis is managed conservatively with topical emollients and Oral / Systemic Immunosuppressives like Methotrexate, Cyclosporin etc.Before starting on PUVA, patients skin is tested for the tolerable effective dose of PUVA, known as MED (minimal erythema dose). The starting dose of PUVA is then calculated as 75% of MED. However, if all of the skin is already red, there cannot be an accurate determination of MED. Therefore, if inadvertant higher doses of PUVA are given in erythrodermic psoriasis without calculating MED, PUVA can further irritate the skin and therefore is not the first choice amongst dermatologist in unstable psoriasis.Nevertheless, PUVA can be given in low doses along with other systemic treatment like methotrexate, cyclosporin etc even in erythrodermic psoriasis.Regards"},{"Patient":"i am suffering from plaque psoriasis from 15 years.i am using folitrax from 3 yrs.till now i have used 640 mg of folitrax.how much folitrax to be taken in our lifespan.my age 25.weight 64kg.in between i have used acetrin 50mg for 2 months.till now it is not cured.is there any other treament.biologics are cost effective.wat z the diet to be followed.i am a veg purely.recently my total cholestrol level z low92mg/dl.HDL z 28mg/dl.LDL Z 40mg/dl","Doctor":"Hello.

The patches in psoriasis are red, scaly and distributed at various body sites, predominantly extensor skin surfaces like elbows, knee and scalp.The disease has a remitting and relapsing course i.e it may re-occur after a seemingly complete cure.Methotrexate is very effective in treating psoriatic patches. Though it is a common drug for treating psoriasis but caution should be exercised in terms of the total cummulative dose; it should be a guide to certain investigations.A liver biopsy is recommended after reaching a total cummulative dose of 1.5 grams of methotrexate, to look for any early/developing fibrotic changes in Liver.In an effort to reduce the total cummulative dose, Methotrexate can be either combined with other treatment modalities like Phototherapy, Acitretin, topical modalities Or it can be alternated with other Immunosuppressive like Cyclosporin.Since you have been taking Methotrexate for 3 years now, amounting to a total cummulative dose of 640 mg, therefore, my approach in you would be to use Methotrexate judiciously i.e either alternated with other Immunosuppressives like Cyclosporin Or combined with Phototherapy and topical treatment modalities.Biologics are newer entrants in the treatment of psoriasis. They specifically target the immune mechanisms involved in the pathogenesis of psoriasis. They are expensive but also produce long lasting remissions.I suggest you to discuss about these points in more details with your treating dermatologist.Regards"},{"Patient":"Dear Sir, Good Morning This is Venkat Satya from Chennai.

My grandfather had it mildly all over, my father, very severe and in big patches on his lower legs, arms, trunk and face apart from the scalp. He used to scratch till blood oozed out.I had Psorises, all over me suddenly in span of a couple of months, starting from a small patch on the outside of the elbow. We used a emuslion made from COCONUT SHELLS, I dont remember about it. It used to flareup every 2 or 3 years an random season. Never took any medication, but applied plenty of White Grease, and a solution of Solid Tar (The ONE USED for making Roads in the seventies with BENZENE.My father prohibited me from touching any patch.I used to clench my fist so tight that my nails dug into the palms and only applied the above medications. I ensured that I never have upset stomach--loose motion or constipation, drink 2 or3 liters of water, plenty of liver in diet apart from fish and chicken, and curd. Consequently in time, the itchy sensation  subsided and I came at peace with myself.The flaring up of Psorises was random and not linked with any season, The quoting of grease made summers difficult as I had a field job travelling 20 days plus, in a month. Exposure to sun and dust worsened the situation.Then in earsy ninetees Psorises took pity on me, or let us say I learnt to live with it and round then I came in touch with a Homeopath. He gave me PSORANIUM 200 for six months 4 times a day, and NUX VOMICA30 for one month every night initially in tandom. Then came MEZROL in 100,000 Potency, 4 timesa day, for about 6 months and weekly since then,No trace of Psorises now,except on my hairline on theforehead and at the back of my ears at the back. But that goes when I put MALAI from milk. MY BP remails, with odd exceptions as 120/80, Fasting Glucose at about 80/90, Chlostrol at about 150, homoglobin at about 14/16, and pulse at about 70 normally except when it slows down to about 60 after 15 minutes of Meditation and remains so for ablut 3 or 4 hours after it.

The recommendation is that females treated with Retinoids should not become pregnant for at least 2 years after completing treatment.Topical treatment is an adjuvant to oral treatment and comprises topical emollients, steroids and Vitamin D analogues.Finally Biologics are the newest category of drugs available to treat psoriasis and produce long remissions.

Thanks for writing to us at healthcaremagicPsoriasis presents as red, scaly, itchy patches at various body sites; commonly extensors like knee, elbow, scalp, hands.Facial involvement is less common but may involve the hair line, that may extend on to the adjacent facial skin.Diagnosis of psoriasis is clinical; skin biopsy may be confirmatory in doubtful cases.Psoriasis is a steroid responsive dermatosis and treatment of limited disease includes potent topical steroids e.g clobetasol propionate halobetasol propionate in cream/oint/lotions.Topical vitamin D analogues e,g calcipotriol, calcitriol are also among the treatment options.Systemic treatment may be started in those who have widespread Or severe involvement (e.g pustular psoriasis, erythrodermic psoriasis).Systemic treatment options include methotrexate, cyclosporine, phototherapy etc.Methotrexate sometimes may also be started in those with limited involvement e.g recalcitrant involvement of hands and feet.Psoriasis is chronic and can recur after seemingly complete cure.Factors that are known to exacerbate psoriasis include drugs, alcohol, infection, stress etcThese are all prescription drugs.

Thanks for writing to us at healthcaremagicThe cream that you have been using contains a potent topical steroid i.e clobetasol propionate 0.05%.Chronic long term regular use of potent steroids can lead to side effects like skin thinning, atrophy and stretch marks.The effects and also the side effects of topical steroids are local i.e at the site of application. If you have been using this cream at these sites where you have developed stretch marks, probably they are due to this cream.However, in some individuals stretch marks can be idiopathic and are part of the growth spurt during puberty.It is not possible to completely erase stretch marks but they can be made to look better cosmetically.Tretinoin is available in a cream form and is known to stimulate collagen production and collagen re-modelling. You may try this cream; results are gradual and usually a 6 months trial period if advisable.Certain procedures like Fractional Co 2 Laser; microneedling etc can also bring reasonable cosmetic improvement by stimulating collagen production.I would suggest that you visit a dermatologist for the needfulRegards"},{"Patient":"Hi, I was diagnosed with psoriasis about three years ago.

They can be used separately at different times of the day and are also available in a combination (clindamycin 1%+benzoyl peroxide 5% gel).Scalp psoriasis presents as thick scaly patches.

It's causing lot of stress. Please advise if it's curable and how many months will it take to cure psoriasis in complete.","Doctor":"Hello. Thanks for writing to us at healthcaremagicPsoriasis is a chronic disease. Till recently there have been no treatment which cures it permanently;  it can recur after seemingly complete cure.However, there is a lot of research going on and it may be possible that in the near future, we have a permanent cure for psoriasis. Nonetheless, treatments are plenty and well established so as to manage all grades of psoriasis.I am not sure you should be trying homeopathic or ayurvedic treatment for psoriasis. I would rather suggest that you visit a dermatologist for a proper assessment, appropriate treatment and follow up at regular intervals.It is important to know about the triggering factors/exacerbation factors and avoid them as far as possible.Various triggering factors are :stress, alcoholism, sore throat, topical irritants like coal tar, pregnancy, certain drugs like NSAIDs, Antihypertensives (B-blockers) etc.Treatment of psoriasis is guided by the extent of involvement. It may remain limited to a few patches Or may extend to involve vast areas of the body. Limited disease is best managed with just topical applications (creams, ointments, gels, lotions, shampoos); whereas extensive disease (involving >20% body surface area) is usually managed with systemic treatments in addition to topical applications.Psoriasis is steroid responsive; the disease gets better with topical steroids, however, it may recur; sometimes as soon as you stop steroids.One has to be very careful in using steroids because though steroids are effective in psoriasis, one cannot use them forever because steroids can lead to side effects like skin atrophy if used over long term; moreover, steroids if stopped suddenly can lead to a rebound flare, which may be of increased intensity as compared to previous episodes.Therefore while steroids are good for providing initial rapid improvement, they should be substituted with alternatives like Vitamin D analogues like calcipotriol, calcitriol once the initial rapid response is attained.Vitamin D analogues are devoid of the side effects of steroids and can also be used safely over long term; moreover rebound flare is not an issue with vitamin D analogues.Scalp involvement requires a coal tar+salicylic acid based shampoo, which can be used thrice weekly.Extensive disease on other hand requires systemic treatment in addition to topical. Methotrexate, Cyclosporin, phototherapy, Biologic response modifiers etc are the treatment options for systemic use.You may ask more about these treatment options from your treating dermatologist.Psoriasis, as I said before is a recurrent condition, therefore I would suggest that you follow up regularly with your treating dermatologist. Your dermatologist can modify your treatment depending on the response.Regards"},{"Patient":"I am 16 and i think that i have mild Guttate Psoriasis. Its lasted about 5 months now.

There can be new/fresh crops of lesions during an episode and recurrent episodes of guttate psoriasis are common.Guttate psoriasis is usually widespread. Therefore treatment options for guttate psoriasis are whole body UV B Phototherapy, oral antibiotics like Erythromycin.Sunlight is believed to play a beneficial role in guttate psoriasis. Topical treatment includes topical emollients, topical steroids, topical vitamin D anlogues like calcipotriol, calcitriol.The patches respond quite well to treatment and the response is usually evident within 2 weeks.I would suggest that you take an appointment with a dermatologist for a confirmatory diagnosis as well as appropriate treatment.Regards"},{"Patient":"i am 35 years old  & a patient of plaque psoriasis of my hand foot for last three years and various dermatologist  in west-Bengal are treating my disease but this disease is not completely cured.

There may psoriatic plaques elsewhere on the body as well.If I was the treating doctor I would have asked you to use a coal tar+salicylic acid based shampoo, daily or every alternate days for mild psoriasis affecting the scalp.Depending on the clinical severity of psoriasis, dermatologists may also ask to apply a topical steroid+salicylic acid lotion for 2-4 weeks, if there are thick scaly plaques of psoriasis, as shampoo alone might not be sufficient.Other effective options apart from steroids that are available to treat scalp psoriasis are topical Vit D analogues like calcipotriol and calcitriol.Psoriasis can recur again after seemingly complete cure.

It doesn't look like the same thing as 2 years ago. Could this be another form of psoriasis?","Doctor":"Hi,The lesions in groin areas and buttocks you described may be most probably folliculitis. Folliculitis is an infection of hair follicles. There may be mild to severe pain. Mild itching may be there. It may be due to friction of the areas. It is not pustular psoriasis.You consult dermatologist for firm diagnosis.You may take antibiotic like cefixime,antiinflammatory like nimesulide and antihistaminics like levocetirizine. Antibiotic like fusidic acid cream may be applied on the lesions. Dettol liquid may be used to cleanse the area.You might feel better after few weeks treatment.

My dermatologist has recommended to take methotrexate by injection once in a week i.e.25 mg (1 ml). Is there any side effect of taking this medicine regularly? How much time it will take to cure psoriasis.- Deepak Salunke","Doctor":"Hello,Welcome to healthcare magic.I understand that you are having psoriasis and are concerned about the treatment.Methotrexate is a very effective drug for controlling psoriasis.The usual adult dose is 10-15 mg per week which is calculated based on the body weight. We usually start at 2.5 mg per week and if there are no side effects gradually escalate the dose.It usually takes 6 weeks ( 6 doses) for you to notice a significant reduction in scaling and redness.Methotrexate is a toxic drug if taken without supervision. Please meet your dermatologist regularly and get a blood work up done to look for blood cell counts and liver function tests. If taken under supervision, it is a very good medicine and most of the patients are happy with it.Hope this helps you.Take care."},{"Patient":"Hi, may I answer your health queries right now ?

These are very expensive and also require regular monitoring for side effects.Shortness of breath and chest pain are usually not associated with psoriasis. If a patient has been on methotraxate, shortness of breath could indicate a side effect of methotrexate called as interstitial pneumonitis. Please check with your treating doctor about the possible treatment modalities I have discussed.Take care and I wish your sister good heath."},{"Patient":"My sister has psoriasis. she was diagnosed initially with dermatitis once a biopsy was done she was then diagnosed with psoriasis. her psoriasis is all over her scalp.. she is losing a lot of hair and it is under her breast and on her thigh. should she see an infectious disease doctor","Doctor":"Hi..,As you said your sister suffers from psoriasis.I would like to say few things about psoriasis... .

There is kind of dead skin tissue coming out when I picking out with my fingers, which is usually clears off after i take head bath.  there has been no itching or spots of blood. Can u please answer?","Doctor":"Hello. Thanks for writing to us at healthcaremagicDandruff if excessive or resistant to regular OTC shampoos can be due to some other cause like seborrheic dermatitis or scalp psoriasis. While seborrheic dermatitis is associated with itching and yellow greasy adherent scales, psoriasis is characterized by well defined patches, with thick scaling, commonly involving the hair line. In psoriasis there may plaques elsewhere on the body. The diagnosis is clinical, therefore a visit to a dermatologist would be useful in that regard.You may use an OTC antifungal shampoo e.g 2% ketoconazole, alternate days, lather it well and leave it for 5 minutes to act before rinsing it off.If this does'nt seem to help you may seek an appointment with a dermatologist for a confirmatory diagnosis. You dermatologist might also put you on topical steroid lotion for a period of about 2 weeks, if he or she feels that there is too much scaling and a shampoo alone might not be sufficient.Thereafter once the scaling is effectively controlled with topical steroid lotion, a shampoo would be effective for maintaining the improvement.Regards"},{"Patient":"hI sir, I have psoriasis for the past 10 years on my left ankle.whenever i apply propygenta nf cream on top of it,it ll get subsided.but now i m able to visualize the symptoms(itching,scaly occurrence) around elbows,knees and itching around my private area n anus.pls help to sort out this problem as it s frustrating me a lot n makes me afraid of going out.","Doctor":"Hello. Thanks for writing to usPsoriasis is a chronic immune mediated disease characterized by scaly plaques on various body sites, characteristically extensors like scalp, elbows, knee, ankles etc.There is a variant of psoriasis which can affect the flexures like groins and perineal area, called as Sebopsoriasis. However, it can be easily confused with a fungal infection, which is fairly common in these areas (body folds). Therefore, I would suggest that you seek an appointment with a dermatologist, to establish as to what is the exact nature of the involvement in body folds, whether psoriasis or fungal infection?As far as the topical cream that you have been using, it contains a potent topical steroid (clobetasol propionate). It is effective in psoriasis because psoriasis is a steroid responsive dermatosis but psoriasis can relapse again after seemingly complete cure.Topical steroids have a down side to them. They cannot be used over a long term because they can induce skin atrophy. Therefore it is always advisable to use topical steroids under the supervision of a dermatologist. A dermatologist would be able to look for any early signs of atrophy and therefore can substitute or change the medicine.Apart from topical steroids various treatment option available for psoriasis are: topical coal tar and salicyclic acid, topical vitamin D analogues, topical psoralens. Systemic treatment options are: oral psoralens and UV A therapy (PUVA), NB- UVB phototehrapy. oral Methotrexate, oral cyclosporin etc.Choice of treatment depends on the severity, extent of involvement and the feasibility of treatment options. This can only be discussed in person with a dermatologistTherefore I would reiterate that any treatment, whether topical or oral, should always be taken under the careful supervision of a dermatologist.Regards"},{"Patient":"hello, this is sathya from tamilnadu,india.my brother affected by skin disease for past fifteen years.the disease is cured a while but returned after som six months when the doctor said to stop taking medicines.now a doctor in singapore found it as Psoriasis.please advise me on treatments so i will convey that to my brother.","Doctor":"Hi..Sathya,As you said your brother suffers from psoriasis from last 15 years.I would like to say few things about psoriasis... .

You consult dermatologist for firm diagnosis and treatment.I usually recommend cap acitretin 10 mg twice a day along with methotraxate 15 mg weekly in three devided doses 12 hourly...for psoriasis.This may be taken for long time till good response. Blood tests may be done to monitor the treatment. For itching, you may take antihistamnics like levocetirizine. Predmet 8 is a steroid.Avoid steroid ,as there may be severe flare up after stopping it.You may apply mild steroid cream or calcipotriol oint on the lesions on the psoriatic lesions. You may apply moisturiser to improve the skin texture. You should avoid soap bath for few weeks..And you should free of stress and worries as that might worsen psoriasis. You might get good result.I hope you got my answer.Thanks.Dr. Ilyas Patel MD"},{"Patient":"Hello Doctor, I am 22 years old and I have psoriasis for past 4-5 years now.

Also ,try not to touch the area too much Use proper sunscreen (spf>26) before going out in the sun so that the lesion doesn't darken any further Take a diet rich in vitamin C and antioxidants like Citrus fruits and lots of salads If after all the above measures, the scars tend to persist, then I would advise that you should see a dermatologist as there are various other measures for the treatment of pigmented scars like the use of chemical peels, dermabrasion etc which a dermatologist can decide according to the type of scars.Hope it helps Wishing you speedy recovery Dr Geetika Paul"},{"Patient":"I have psorises at scalpe.My doctor has given me Psorid (100 mg)of Bio Con.I am taking this medicine twice daily since last 15 days but there is no great relief.Someone has suggested me No skurf lotion.I want to know whether that will be help full.Should I use any  shampoo with this.","Doctor":"Hi,As you said you have scalp psoriasis...it may be relapsing and may for long time.I advise you to take regular and proper treatment of psoriasis from your dermatologist.

Doctors have diagnosed it to be Psoraisis and incurable.How far is it true that it is Incurable? Any therapy such as Ultravoilet therapy would help ?Please suggest course of action for permanent curing it. Please suggest any precautions.Thanks a lot","Doctor":"Hello and welcome to healthcaremagicPsoriasis is characterized by the presence of well defined, thick scaly plaques mainly involving the scalp, and extensor surfaces like elbow, knee, lower back etc. The disease has a chronic course and the course is fluctuated by remissions and relapses, however there is no permanent cure for psoriasis.Specific topical treatment options for psoriatic plaques consists of ointments containing potent steroid with or without salicylic acid. These are available in ointment form for plaques involving the body and as lotions/gels/foam form for scalp psoriasis. Topical Vitamin D analogues like calcipotriol, calcipotriene etc are also effective for localized plaque psoriasis.Besides specific remedies for psoriasis, moisturisers form an important part in the management of psoriasis because of the thick scaly nature of the plaques. Moisturizers enhance the penetration of topical active ingredients as well as prevents or delays side effects like skin atrophy etc.Unlike extensive psoriatic disease for which both oral and topical treatment is required, for limited disease topical treatment alone is effective.Phototherapy, particularly NB-UVB phototherapy is one of the several treatment options for psoriasis. It is effective and well tolerated by most. Moreover, NB-UVB Phototherapy is one of the safest options for treatment of psoriasis and can also be used even in pregnant females as well as children.Other treatments for widespread disease includes Immunosuppressives like methotrexate, cyclosporin.Oral retinoids e.g Acitretin can also be used for widespread psoriasis either alone or together with phototherapy.Hope this helpsRegards"},{"Patient":"Hi Doctor, I am a patient of Psoriasis from Last 10 years , It has began from head and then spots on the body...the same was cured 5 years back but now  the spots had started again appearing on my body, nails  and hair.

Unfortunately the disease can relapse after seemingly complete cure. The course of psoriasis is indeed marked by remissions and relapses and available treatment options can only induce the disease into remission, rather than permanently cure it.For scalp psoriasis, I prefer to start my patients on a coal tar+salicylic acid based shampoo. Along with that I also ask my patients to apply a potent topical steroid lotion with or without salicylic acid, twice daily.Since psoriasis is a steroid responsive dermatosis, it responds very well to topical steroids, which must be gradually tapered to prevent a rebound flare.Alternative to topical steroids are topical Vitamin D analogues like calcipotriol lotion, which are steroids sparing agents  and are thus devoid of the side effects commonly encountered with long term steroids use.These are prescription medications, I would suggest that you consult your dermatologist before trying these out.Regards"},{"Patient":"hi ,i am 28 yr female.i am suffering from psoriasis from more than last 15 yrs. already hve tried all the forms of medicines like ayurveda ,homeopathy ,& allopathy out of which homeopathy lead to severe flaring up of disease.plz tell if i ever be able to get rid of this disease,.right now i have this disease in both of my soles & on leg also.plz suggest me the best possible treatment for psoriasis in delhi.","Doctor":"Hello and welcome to healthcaremagicI can understand your concern and frustration regarding the chronicity of psoriasis.

Creams and lotions are the 1 st line of treatment for limited disease. If they do not seem to be working, other options include phototherapy ( Narrow band UV-B and PUVA therapy). This involves exposing the involved sites to light of a particular wavelength in specialised chambers. The other options include oral methotrexate. This is a toxic drug but highly efficacious in the treatment of psoriasis. This is also cheap.

While topical treatment alone suffices for limited disease, oral + topical treatment are together useful for disease involving more than 20% of the body surface area.Methotrexate is just one of the several options for treatment of psoriasis. It is an immunosuppressive. It has a long history of use in psoriasis and with proper monitoring and follow up , it is considered to be one of the safest drugs. Serious side effects that are reported with its use in psoriasis are bone marrow suppression, liver abnormalities (fatty liver, cirrhosis) etc.Cyclosporin is another immunosupressive that can be used for rapid control of severe widespread erthrodermic or pustular psoriasis. However, it can cause raised blood pressure and raise serum creatinine, therefore requires monitoring for BP as well as serum creatinine levels. It is a sort of a rescue drug for severe widespread psoriasis, not for limited disease.Phototherapy, particularly NB-UVB phototherapy is one of the several treatment options for psoriasis. It is effective and well tolerated by most. Moreover, NB-UVB Phototherapy is one of the safest options for treatment of psoriasis and can also be used even in pregnant females as well as children.Oral retinoids e.g Acitretin can also be used for widespread psoriasis either alone or together with phototherapy.Finally Biologics like Infliximab, Adalimumab, Etanercept are newer remedies and includes monoclonal antibodies, interleukins, interferons and colony stimulating factors etc.Unlike extensive psoriatic disease for which both oral and topical treatment is required, for limited disease topical treatment alone is effective.Specific topical treatment options for psoriatic plaques consist of ointments containing potent steroid with or without salicylic acid.

As you might be aware, it can be well controlled with treatment, though there is no definite cure for it.The management depends on the extent of psoriasis.Some ways to prevent newer lesions would be to keep the skin moisturized, cut down stress levels, prevent infections and to stop alcohol consumption.Moisturization plays a key role as dry skin tends to worsen psoriasis. Dry skin could be itchy and psoriasis tends to spread on areas of trauma (from scratching).Moisturize often especially at the beginning of winters ( when psoriasis could flare) and also if you are in an air conditioned atmosphere.Stress has found to have a direct role in relapses. Do continue yoga and other stress management techniques which will help in preventing relapses.Infections, especially throat infections could lead to flare ups. Treat an infection promptly.Alcohol has also found to have a direct correlation with psoriasis. Try to cut down or stop alcohol consumption completely to prevent flares.Hope you find this helpful.Take care."},{"Patient":"hello Sir..i have been diagonised to have psoriosis and i have been given a tablet Melanocyl. when i browsed in the internet, there are few sites that says it has side effects. is it advisable to take that tablet or should i go for another?kindly advice.Thanks","Doctor":"Hello and welcome to healthcaremagicPsoriasis is an inflammatory skin disease characterised by well defined erythematous scaly plaques with silvery white or candle wax type of scaling.

It can affect sites like scalp, arms, and legs, (specifically elbows and knees), palms and soles etc Other types of psoriasis are: Erythrodermic psoriasis, Pustular psoriasis (generalised and localised), Nail psoriasis and Scalp psoriasis.There are various precipitating factors for psoriasis: Infections(sore throat, dental infections etc), drugs (b-blockers used for hypertension), pregnancy, winters (psoriasis becomes worse in winters), stress, alcohol intake and cigarette smoking, topical irritants like coal tar, salicylic acid and withdrawal of oral/ topical steroids etc. The disease has a chronic course and there topical creams/ointments/gels/lotions etc as well as oral and injectable medicines which can treat psoriasis but there is no permanent cure for psoriasis.Topical treatment:Moisturizers specially those which contain hygroscopic (attract water from the atmosphere and lock it into the skin) and keratoloytic agents like Ammonium lactate(Amylac cream), Urea, Lactic acid etc are especially useful in dry scaly conditions like psoriasis.For the patches you could use a steroid+salicylic acid ointment, twice daily (clobetasol+3% OR 6% salicylic acid in an ointment base e.g propysalic) over and above the moisturizer for 4 weeks.Other treatment modalities which can be used for localized plaque psoriasis are: Vit D analogues like calcipotriol, calcipotriene alone or in combination with steroid.Oral treatment:-Once weekly oral methotrexate is another option in case of plaque psoriasis but it should always be taken under the supervision of a dermatologist since it can rarely cause serious side effects like bone marrow suppression.-Oral cyclosporine is given for extensive psoriasis involving more than 20% of the body surface area. It is rapidly effective but it requires monitoring of kidney functions and BP.Other commonly used oral treatment modalities are:-Oral Psoralens e.g 8-methoxypsoralen and UV A phototherapy  (PUVA)-Narrow-Band phototharapy(NB-UVB)-Biologics response modifiers (Etanercept, Infliximab, Adalimumab etc)In general, in limited psoriasis only topical agents are used, whereas if the disease involves >20% body surface area, it is better to combine both topical and oral therapies.I would suggest that you see a dermatologist and have a fair discussion regarding the most appropriate treatment modalities for you.regards"},{"Patient":"hello doctor, iam suffering from severe psoriasis on my abdomen, buttock, legs and back. I also have severe scalp psoriasis and have been finding it extremely embarrasing to interact with any one. I always applied topical ointments like dovobet, dermobet or tenovate with hardly any improvements as they kept coming back in large areas over the body. For the scalp i applied Ionax T shampoo and propysalic lotion but within few hours they dried up again now my doc prescribed me alaspan (once in the morning after breakfast) and Xevor at bedtime along with propysalic NFG for body application and saliben for scalp.iam too scared to try out new medicines as i fear larger outbreak. pls. help and advise desperately seeking advise rgds","Doctor":"Hello,Welcome to healthcare magic,I understand that you have extensive psoriasis and it is not coming under control with topical steroids and salicylic acid preparations. If more than 20% body surface area is involved you may even try systemic treatment for psoriasis like methotrexate, acitretin under supervision of a good dermatologist. You may also try phototherapy (Narrow band UVB or PUVA) for extensive psoriasis if you have not tried it before.Propysalic NF is a combination of topical steroid and salicylic acid and Alaspan and Xevor are antihistamine tablets. They are alright and don't worry about them causing outbreak. Follow up with your doctor as advised and discuss other options mentioned above. Do not take stress as it worsens psoriasis.Hope this helped,Take care."},{"Patient":"hi there, my husband was on sandimmune for eczema almost 2 years ago. i just want to know the period we should wait to conceive. his doctor has told him to wait 2 years then try falling pregnant.. what are the effects? and is his doctor correct in waiting two years. his biological clock is ticking... thanks","Doctor":"Hi.His doctor was right to ask him to wait for a while as the sperm can be slightly defective whilst on sandimmune, and it surely is a major contributing factor to birth defects.

As you are having scalp psoriasis moderate to severe variety first try with topical application of solution containing clobetasol and salisylic acid and apply twice daily which will remove scales. Use shampoo which contains coal tar with salisylic acid or containing steroid  which also helps in it.To relieve itch take antihistaminic tabs.With this if you dont find any improvement then you have to take methotraxate tabs in pulse doses start with 7.5mgper week but after thorough investigations done.if you still don't find improvement contact me further."},{"Patient":"I have psoraisis on my hands and elbows.

Treatment of this condition consist in giving drugs that suppress the symptoms and activity of this disease.
