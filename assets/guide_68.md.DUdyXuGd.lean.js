How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

I want to assure you not to worry as everything is going to be fine if proper care and treatment is opted in for. I have thoroughly gone through your case and can well understand your genuine health concerns. 1. No, there is not much problem right now as he vomited and also had a lot of water. It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases. Because, it is a volatile compound and causes vapors entering the lungs through the airways. 3. As it was only two drops, I do not think it may cause much trouble. If he feels short of breath contact me back, otherwise fine. 1. He should avoid re-exposure. 2.

For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations. If the size and number of cysts are more, then I suggest consulting a gynecologist as you may require surgery.

As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves.

The blue light you are referring to should be NB-UVB (narrow band ultraviolet B) chamber treatment which is quite effective and safe modality.  2. The blisters can be easily managed by decreasing the duration of exposure. The only drawback is that you will have to visit the dermatologist every alternate day, which seems to be difficult for you.  3. Also, you are applying Melanocyl lotion (Methoxsalen). Since how long are you applying it? Did it have any good effect?  4. Another option is tablet Melanocyl. The usual dose is 20 mg on alternate days. Two hours later, sunlight exposure is given for 10-15 minutes.  5, Biopeptides, topical steroids, etc., can be given.  6. Skin grafting can be carried out.  7.

Since then, I have had stomach issues including: going to the bathroom more often, feeling pressure when having to go to the bathroom, occasional mucus in stool, and more recently, bouts of nausea, bloating/cramping, and very smelly gas. I have had various blood panels, tried probiotics (including VSL), rifaximin, diet changes, and I'm currently on Viberzi, which helped but made me a bit constipated/tired/bloated, so I lowered the dosage to 1 pill (100mg) per day instead of 2, which decreased side effects but also decreased effectiveness of the drug. Also, it seems my metabolism has shifted after the antibiotics and I gained weight faster than I ever have, and I am still struggling to keep my weight down after making significant diet and lifestyle changes. Any insight here into the weight gain and then anything else I could try for the stomach symptoms? Thank you!","Doctor":"Hello, Welcome to icliniq I have reviewed your concern. After taking antibiotics your gut bacterial composition has been changed and it has started to cause troubles for you. Weight gain is also seen in such cases. Since you have tried a lot of things and finally viberzi showing some results for you. I am happy things have finally got some control. For your concern regarding relatively rapid weight gain and metabolic shift is genuine. I would say, you are a good observant. What further helps you to restore your gut bacterial composition is to opt for natural selection. Like food changes, you have to avoid junk and bakery products as much as possible, Take alot of yoghurt (natural probiotic) and fruits. Increase use of vegetables. Avoid alcohol if you are taking. Continue exercise or at lease try to remain active. Collectively, this will change the story, you will feel better, but definitely process is slow and it will take time. So you have to exercise patience. I hope you will find it super helpful, give your feedback, let us know after a week, how you feel.

I want my teeth back in the normal position.","Doctor":"Hi. I have gone through your images (attachment removed to protect patient identity). This is midline pathological diastema,that means there was either an aggressive infection or the formation of a cyst (midline palatal cyst) that cause the gap. This can also happen due to trauma. In your case, if there is no more swelling or there is no more drainage of pus, you can go for fixed orthodontic appliances followed by a retainer. You do not want to build up your teeth with filling material. But in case if there is any primary cause, you need to treat it first. Please reply to my following questions: I need an IOPA (intraoral periapical radiograph) and OPG (orthopantomogram) of the region to view the cause. Brush twice daily with an ultrasoft brush.

How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

I want to assure you not to worry as everything is going to be fine if proper care and treatment is opted in for. I have thoroughly gone through your case and can well understand your genuine health concerns. 1. No, there is not much problem right now as he vomited and also had a lot of water. It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases. Because, it is a volatile compound and causes vapors entering the lungs through the airways. 3. As it was only two drops, I do not think it may cause much trouble. If he feels short of breath contact me back, otherwise fine. 1. He should avoid re-exposure. 2.

For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations. If the size and number of cysts are more, then I suggest consulting a gynecologist as you may require surgery. If the number and size of cysts are less, you may continue treatment along with syrup Evecare 10 ml BD and Kanchnar Guggulu two BD.

As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses. For further information consult an obstetrician and gynaecologist online -->"},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I have oily dandruff and dry hairs and hair fall. So what should I do if I wash hairs every day so they will become more dry and thin too?","Doctor":"Hello. Many people with dandruff have oily skin and the latest research shows that the real culprit is probably a tiny fungus called Malassezia globosa that needs oil to grow. It only becomes a problem when the fungus grows too rapidly, and our natural renewal of cells is disturbed. It causes skin cells to renew too fast and dandruff will start to show because the skin cells bond with the oil on the surface of your scalp. This process results in the formation of white flakes. Regular shampooing can even irritate your skin that may aggravate flakes formation. Do not wash your hair more than two times a week or every alternate day. Use organic shampoos without skin irritants. While washing your hair use lukewarm water. Do not use nails just massage it gently with fingers. Then wash with cold water. You may use antifungal Nizoral shampoo to control dandruff. You may use it once a week for six to eight weeks. If symptoms still persist, you need to consult your dermatologist. He will guide you in the right way.

Can I take Norethisterone tablets now for a week? I need to delay my periods which are due in two days.","Doctor":"Hello. You have to understand that I-pill is a high dose Progesterone pill, much stronger than Norethisterone. So, if your aim is to avoid pregnancy then you have to wait for the withdrawal bleeding for the endometrium to be shed out to confirm pregnancy safety. Your menses if were due in the next two days, then they are naturally likely to be delayed because of I-pill intake by about 4 to 5 days because of high Progesterone content.  If you intend to delay menses and at the same time ensure pregnancy safety together then it would be difficult to ensure any pregnancy safety, because if you get pregnant then this Norethisterone would further support the pregnancy and not prevent it. The I-pill increases tubal motility and hence if Progesterone is not withdrawn, as after its single dose, pregnancy may happen and I-pill may fail. So ideally wait for your menses now within next seven days and if the bleeding is heavy then you may take antifibrinolytics to reduce the bleeding but do not delay it this time, for pregnancy safety takes an upper hand over your intended delay of menses."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, My mom is not feeling well, and I am concerned about internal bleeding.

I am male, 29 years, 5\\"10', 80 kg, good physique, sharp mind (according to my colleagues, teachers and academic performance), extrovert, suffering from moderate hair loss (genetic), family history of heart diseases and hypertension (though my BP is absolutely fine as I regularly exercise), suffering from OCD and moderate depression for last one year (due to career and some personal reasons). I am taking Paroxetine for this and that has been helpful, the condition has improved. I am prone to gain weight easily, sometimes suffer from constipation, prone to acidity, prone to anxiety, cannot remain hungry, become irritable when hungry, maximum hunger in the morning, always take heavy breakfast, regularly do exercise. Now my question. Please suggest some herb, capsule or ayurvedic remedy which can act as a general body tonic in long-term, desired effects, anti-aging, maintaining youth, stamina, strength, sexual power, muscle building, avoiding diseases which people generally get in the 50s, means something which is very good for overall physical and mental health. You can tell me any herb or capsule, or multiple capsules. This is my main question and if you wish, you can tell me something which can help me with OCD and depression. Earlier I used to get increased pitta as my dosha (when I was suffering from hair loss 2 to 3 years back), but now I get increased vata dosha (for last year since when I am suffering from OCD and depression), some give me a mix of increased pitta and vata doshas.","Doctor":"Hello. I just read your query. See let me tell you one thing first that your mind is under your control. If you cannot change anything then there is no need to crib on it. So first of all, let go of the things which make you angry, sad or affect your mood. Because one single negative thought is enough to spoil a day. One day has gone and it will happen again and again, and as a result, you will get some psychological problem. As you have asked about herbs which can help you in remaining healthy forever, so let me tell you stress and depression play a major role in your physical fitness too because in depression, at the hormonal level and chemical level many reactions occur which refrain your body from doing many good things. So try to remain positive as much as you can. Now come to medicine, as you have moderate depression and you also want something which has anti-aging effects and good effects on sexual power, etc., start taking capsule Ashwagandha two capsules two times a day with water after food for one month. It has multiple benefits according to your problems. Ashwagandha will help you in depression as well as improve your physical health. Along with this, take capsule Brahmi two capsules two times a day with water after food for one month. These will calm your mind and body. It will help you in OCD (obsessive-compulsive disorder) and depression. For hair loss take Mahabhringraj oil and do gentle massage with it on your scalp on every alternate day. Wash your hairs with mild herbal shampoo. Take Asthiposhak tablets two tablets two times a day with water after food for one month for hair growth. Add curry leaves, figs, raisins, in your diet for hair growth. Take one glass of lukewarm milk at bedtime and add some almond powder and some cardamom powder and a little bit of honey in it. Avoid TV, laptop and mobile one hour before sleeping because their blue light hinders normal sleep pattern. Try to do meditation daily as it is beneficial for mind and will stabilize your mood. If you can spare some time then you can go to a nearby Panchakarma center and ask for procedures like Shirodhara, etc., which have good results in depression. Try all these things regularly and you will feel positive results within a month. Consult me after one month regarding improvement and for further management or you can consult a nearby reputed ayurveda physician too.

I no longer get my periods. What are my chances of conception? Doctors say I am at menopause. Can I have a successful IVF?","Doctor":"Hi. The best age for a lady to get pregnant is 19-35 years. The principle behind this is, every day your eggs are growing and out of the cohort of eggs, the best egg is selected, and remaining growing eggs go for atrophy. So by 35 years most of the good eggs are gone. After that age too, you have the chance of pregnancy, but lesser than the age of 35 years. After 40 years of age, the chance of pregnancy further reduce. As the age of lady increases the eggs left behind are not as healthy as the previous month. So even if you get pregnant, the baby is at risk of developing anomalies. But if your period has stopped, then you need to know if there are any eggs in ovaries. You can have any of the birth control pills (packet of 21 pills) twice daily for 10 days. No matter what the cause is, you will have periods within 7-10 days. On day 3 or 4 of the period do serum FSH (follicle-stimulating hormone) and AMH (anti-mullerian hormone). FSH >7 Miu/ml and AMH < 1.1 ng/ ml means egg count is below normal. The only option for pregnancy is IVF using donor eggs. This can definitely be the best option to get pregnant. I hope this helps."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I recently have come down with Peyronie's disease. Will the mechanical penis straightening devices fix this condition? I am 59 years old and I have never had this condition before. Also, it seems like this condition started when I started taking a Viagra lower cost substitute simply sold as Sildenafil a couple of months ago. The start of the condition seems to coincide with the start of taking Sildenafil. Maybe just a coincidence?","Doctor":"Hi. Firstly, the reason for developing Peyronie's is due to repeated microtrauma which slowly gets fibrosed. It takes many months to develop and it is not related to the change of medication. Secondly, for management, it depends on how severe the fibrosis is. Mechanical stretching and straightening do help if the lesion is small and the fibrosis is not very severe. It is unlikely that they will completely fix the condition, but you will be able to achieve enough straightening to engage in intercourse.

I have a mild acne and huge pores on my cheeks. Currently, I have purchased a variety of products and would like to receive your input as to whether or not this is a terrible routine or one that will work to create healthy skin. Every day I take Beta-Carotene, Lycopene, and Astaxanthin supplements. Morning (every-other) I use moisturizer, then apply Niacinamide lotion, Moisturize, then apply Azelaic Acid cream. At night, moisturize, then apply Retinol cream.","Doctor":"Hi. Your skin routine is good, you can go on with it. Please choose a moisturizer that is not clogging, and is non-comedogenic, lotion form is better than cream since you have mild acne. Niacinamide and Azelaic acid are helpful for acne, they are mild, but a higher concentration of Azelaic acid can cause little irritation to the skin. If Azelaic acid is 4 % and less, it should be fine to use every day.  Retinol works well for enlarged pores, also for acne. It helps to exfoliate the skin. Start retinol slow, use a thin layer on the face on alternate nights initially, then increase the frequency of application to nightly, Retinol is anti-aging too, it helps with wrinkles, pigmentation. Beta-carotene, Lycopene are antioxidants, they are considered as systemic or oral sunscreen.  Only, addition to your routine is to use a moisturizer with sunscreen that is non-comedogenic, use this in the morning instead of your regular moisturizer. Sunscreen is the must in any skin routine, UV rays from sunlight are the reason for early wrinkles, pigmentation of skin as well as skin cancer (squamous cell carcinoma and basal cell carcinoma, melanomas). Keep your body hydrated with at least 2 to 3 liters of water per day, and consume fruits and vegetables which are rich in beta-carotene and vitamin A like carrot, papaya, watermelon, muskmelon, pomegranate."},{"Patient":"Hi, I was supposed to get my period on the 19th of this month. Generally, my period lasts 25 days, but it did not arrive this month. After taking a urine test using a pregnancy detection kit, I received a positive result. So, I think I am pregnant. I have not taken a scan or contacted a doctor. I do not want to carry my pregnancy. Is it necessary to have a scan performed before taking abortion pills or can I take the pills directly? If so, can you please make suggestions as to the pills I should take and how to use them? Also, what is the last date for me to terminate my pregnancy using pills? If there are any side effects, please mention them as well.","Doctor":"Hi and welcome to icliniq.com. Since a urine pregnancy test result was positive, you are pregnant. However, it is very important to confirm the same by scan and to locate the pregnancy to make sure it is in the uterus and not outside, which is called an ectopic pregnancy. Ectopic pregnancies cannot be aborted by pills and they present a dangerous situation, which requires immediate medical attention. You can terminate an intra-uterine pregnancy with pills up to 63 days after the first day of your last period. Following that, failure rates are high. The earlier the termination, the less risk of complications. Pills for termination cannot be prescribed over the phone or online, as it is illegal and dangerous. I would also advise you to consult an obstetrician and gynaecologist online about receiving counseling on ending your pregnancy -->  Take care."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor,I am trying to conceive but my husband and I did cocaine a week ago. How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases.

For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations.

As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves.

Now we are married for four years and I am not getting pregnant. My age is 40 and my husband is 42. Please suggest.","Doctor":"Hello. I understand it has been a year since your endometriosis surgery. I am not clear if you have taken any treatment following that to enable conception. From the limited information, you have given me and assuming that your partner's parameters are normal (as you have not mentioned anything about it), I will try to make my suggestions. As age advances, the maternal ovarian reserve comes down, which means the number of eggs a female has come down. Endometriosis is a disease that not only affects the ovaries but later causes adhesions, which also hamper your chance for pregnancy. It is also notorious to recur. Putting all these together, the chances of a natural pregnancy comes down, though definitely not impossible. But the medical advice here and the ideal thing would be not to lose too much time and go in for ART procedures like IVF (in vitro fertilization). Because once the maternal ovarian reserve becomes too low, the chances of pregnancy in an IVF cycle also becomes less. So it would be ideal not to waste time and think of approaching any of the IVF centers. Also, I would like to add that this COVID time is not the right time to start an IVF treatment though. I hope this helps."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, Emergency contraception is 95% effective means is there some chance of getting pregnant?

Will it change the number of days of period? And what is withdrawal bleeding? Will it be there immediately after taking it? Or after a day or two? When it will be 100% effective? Is there any other way to avoid pregnancy completely in unprotected sex?","Doctor":"Hi. I have read and understood your problem. Yes, there is some chance of pregnancy. You can use condom, but there is no contraception 100% effective even after contraception-operation very small chance of pregnancy remains. You can bleed any day after taking I-pill. There is no fixed rule it may take even 10 days and bleeding usually will be normal not painful. When bleeding occurs after stopping pill, it is called withdrawal bleeding. Withdrawal bleeding rules out pregnancy. However, your next period may come early or late, so take precaution with adequate contraception. Contraceptive pills can change your bleeding amount and cycle for one or two months. It will be effective only after sex pill, not before sex.

Sometimes, it can make periods come early and sometimes, it can delay. In your case, it made your periods early. But, I want to caution you that you should not use I-pill medicine in daily routine as it is a very strong medicine and have side effects also. In your case, you did not even need to take I-pill because your periods finished on 12th and you had sex on 15th. You cannot become pregnant if you do sex in the first 10 days of your periods.

In the space of two weeks, I developed an allergic reaction to three different foods peanuts, shellfish, and Avacado. I never had problems with either of these foods (or any food for that matter) before and this hit me very suddenly. So far the reactions are mild, just some minor tingling and flushing of skin, particularly on my arms, but they are significant enough to be noticeable. I have always been into health and fitness and take a variety of vitamins and supplements though I am cutting back on those out of concern that they may have aggravated my immune system into producing this allergic response. My questions are: is it normal to develop an allergy to multiple foods simultaneously? And what can I do to prevent the onset of any further reactions developing? I am currently on Memantine and Adderall.","Doctor":"Hi. First of all, allergic reactions to food are sudden and happen without any prior history. It is very common for people to develop allergies. Yes, it is common to have these kinds of food allergies. Some people have episodic allergies and they subside completely and for few people, it stays. No one can prevent an allergic episode in the future. It is your genetic system that has caused this. You should always keep anti-allergic tablets, steroid tablets, and always have a back up to get a steroid shot for allergies. Because sometimes these might range from basic skin rashes, itching and flushing to life-threatening spasms. Hence should always be careful. When you consume the above foods next time, keep observing for symptoms. I hope this helps."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, My 72-year-old mother is diabetic.

How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases.

For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations. If the size and number of cysts are more, then I suggest consulting a gynecologist as you may require surgery.

As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves.

I am 49 years old and have the following established preexisting conditions like Hashimoto's, slight hypertension, migraines since childhood, and some allergies. I do have recurrent episodes of polyuria for many years that were diagnosed as stress-related some years ago after all differentials had been excluded.

All other results including CBC are normal, PSA and AFP, as well as HCG are negative, sexual hormones panel is normal. I cannot detect any abnormalities with my testicles. I understand that any detected beta HCG in males indicates a malignancy. How worried should I be?","Doctor":"Hi. First of all, I must say you have written your history very well. What I searched and concluded is: 1. About your HCG (human chorionic gonadotropin) level, your b-HCG is raised while total HCG is normal. Get it repeated from some other lab, if still raised then proceed to step 2 and 3. 2. Get ultrasound scrotum (to see for any hyoechoic areas or area of calcification). 3. Get FNAC (fine needle aspiration cytology) or excision biopsy of 3-5 cm lesion below your nipple. I understand that any detected beta HCG in males indicates a malignancy. How worried should I be? To answer this question, I was just wondering why you got HCG done in first place as you were asymptomatic? Neither of the drugs you are taking does not interfere with this test (b HCG). You cannot just ignore and sit on it (if b-HCG is deranged), you have to find a cause be it faulty lab investigation itself."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, My wife is 70 years old and was diagnosed with typhoid and was given Ceftas 200 TDS for 21 days and Argex 500 OD for seven days.

I have consulted it with a doctor and he says that, there is some depression still left in me and also there may be a damage in the concentration centre of the brain because of the long existing depression. Now my question is will my concentraion improve, and when shall I be able to speak and read in my mind properly?","Doctor":"Hi, Thanks for posting a query at icliniq. First of all I need to know what was the drug, how long you took that medicine and have you felt tolerance to either effect or side effect of that drug? At this stage I like to inform you that with current available medication, only two thirds of the patients improve, the remaining and the other one third fail to improve even after trial of multiple drugs. The next course of action is decided on the basis of residual symptoms, magnitude of improvement, comorbid medical and psychiatric conditions, tolerability and affordability to name a few. In your case your doctor may be right but if you are taking same medication for more than six weeks then it is time to intervene. If the concentration problem arose after the use of drug then it might be the side effect of drug itself and in that case it needs replacement. If the prescribed drug dose is in lower range side, then increasing the drug dose might be the solution. At this stage I would like to tell you that drugs available currentlyt may be used for improving concentration after a detailed history of the patient and review of all previous drugs. I suggest you to approach a psychiatrist either online or in person for correction of your problem. You can also book a slot for an online video chat session, I will be happy to help you out."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor,I had this diet with no rice and meat for five months. Is it healthy? I eat meat but only when I attend occasions. I was 99 back then and now I am 73 kg.","Doctor":"Hello. An ideal diet is a balanced combination of carbohydrates, proteins, and fats. Eating meat is not a necessity if you are taking adequate vegetarian proteins. If you are avoiding rice, but substituting that with any other healthy carbohydrate, that should be fine too. But remember that your diet should be sustainable. Always look into the future and think if you can follow a particular diet all your life. If the answer is no, that may not be the ideal diet for you. Another point I would like to add is that rice is a healthy grain, just as other grains are shown to be. Rice contains many nutrients. If your ancestors have been eating rice, then it is the grain your body recognizes and digests easily. Eat what your grandmother would feed you, cook all your meals at home, include lots of fruit and vegetables and your diet will be sorted. I hope that helps.

(This is better seen in the red-free images.) The same area of damage is seen again in the OCT (optical coherence tomography) reports, both in the disc scan and the ganglion cell analysis. Finally, this area of damage is confirmed on the visual field report. The darkened spots seen are suggestive of an early visual field loss called a nasal step that is commonly seen in glaucoma. (This will need to be confirmed in a second visual field report repeated two weeks to one month after the first test. These investigations confirm the diagnosis of glaucoma in the right eye. However, since the recorded intraocular pressure is 18 mmHg, that is, within the normal limits, my main differentials, in this case, would be: The left eye appears normal as of now, but this condition can be asymmetric in its incidence.

For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations. If the size and number of cysts are more, then I suggest consulting a gynecologist as you may require surgery. If the number and size of cysts are less, you may continue treatment along with syrup Evecare 10 ml BD and Kanchnar Guggulu two BD.

She had taken my blood sample and it was negative. But, still I have not gotten my periods and it has been a week ahead. What could be the reason for my late periods?","Doctor":"Hello. As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses.

Today, I feel weak and dizzy, as I am fasting, and I took the injection while fasting. What medication best suits my case? Thank you so much.","Doctor":"Hi. I saw the picture (attachment removed to protect patient identity). This is acute urticaria. I suggest you try taking the following: Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. Tablet Avil (Pheniramine maleate) is antihistamine that can cause drowsiness. Some patients complain of drowsiness even after taking Levocetirizine. But you need to take Levocetirizine. Any tablet taken on an empty stomach can cause gastritis. If you have difficulty in swallowing or breathing, then you should visit a doctor immediately. Get the following blood test done: If urticaria is persistent, and if you still have the rashes, then I suggest Injection Avil 2 cc IM and Injection Hydrocort (Hydrocortisone sodium succinate) 100 mg IV.

I applied a lotion (Salicylic acid 16.7% and Lactic acid 16.7%), and the skin tag was removed. But, it came back after three months. Currently, I am suffering from genital warts and taking treatment. My doctor told me to get some test and here are the results. Lipid profile - triglycerides 125 mg/dL, HDL 35 mg/dL and LDL 113 mg/dL, CBC - lymphocyte 44%, serum amylase 121 IU/L, Helicobacter pylori IgA 0.45 (negative) and urine test - pus cells 3 to 4/HPF. Currently, I am taking these medicine as advised by my doctor.

Warts and molluscum are common sexually acquired infections and can occur in healthy individuals. Warts spread by touch and condoms will only protect the covered area. Base of the penis, thighs, lower abdomen are all exposed. So, both warts and molluscum can be transmitted even with condom usage. For treatment, I suggest you Imiquimod 5% cream. Apply it over the affected area thrice a week and leave it overnight and wash in the morning. Use it for 16 weeks.

How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases.

I have been constipated, bad back pains, been very fatigued, nauseous, and often feeling of having to pee. I have not fully missed a period but had a very light period a little over a week ago, it was way darker than normal also very light and lasted for maybe two days. Which is odd because I have been taking birth control for almost three years now so my period has become very regular and the same consistency each time. Also another weird thing, since I am curious if I am with child or not, I have stopped taking my birth control, and as you should know, when you stop taking it the next day you bleed. Which is what normally happens to me if I miss one. But, I have not had any blood at all and it has been four days now. A week back, I took two pregnancy tests which both came out negative. Is it possible that I have taken the tests too early? I am going to a clinic today but not sure if I should.","Doctor":"Hello. Learning that you have been taking your birth control since last three years regularly, the bleeding that you had a week before in form of scanty menses was a breakthrough bleed and can happen in cases with prolonged oral contraceptive pill uses. The pregnancy test is negative, which it should be. The menses should generally occur after 5 to 7 days post stoppage pill pack. So, if no menses in a week, post-pill stoppage then a serum beta hCG test may be done to rule out any pregnancy conclusively first and if negative then you should wait for the menses to occur (the symptoms experienced are then premenstrual symptoms and not for pregnancy)."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I am a 29 year old female with a 15 year history of panic disorder with medicine sensitivity. I have been on Effexor XR 75 mg for six months and have been stable. Last week my tooth was pulled out and I was put on Motrin 800. I had around two tablets for three days and it made me feel fuzzy and my chest heavy. My vitals are all normal. My boyfriend is a surgeon and he monitored me. I was also put on Amoxicillin 875 mg BID. After my follow-up visit with oral surgeon, I was put on Z-Pak. Within a few hours of my first dose of Z-Pak I felt sick. That night, I woke up with chest pain and dizziness and had a panic attack. It subsided after a few minutes, but I have not been feeling good since. I do have a low grade temperature (99.2), chills and hot flashes. When I am sick, my anxiety does kick into high gear. I took Ativan 0.5 mg. I am nervous because this is the most anxiety I have had in a while. Does this mean my Effexor is not working?","Doctor":"Hi. The heightened anxiety, panic attacks, uneasiness, hot or cold flushes, sleep disturbance, low grade fever could all be the symptoms of Venlafaxine withdrawal. Did you miss a dose of Venlafaxine? Another explanation is that these medicines that you are taking for your tooth issue interacted with Venlafaxine, thereby reducing its effect. Though, there is no reported interaction between these medicines, individual differences in metabolism are common and could be a cause in your case. My advice for you would be not to jump to the conclusion that Venlafaxine has stopped working. Take higher doses of Ativan, even up to 2 mg thrice a day if required for the next few days. Wait till the other drugs are out of your system that is for three to four days and check whether the anxiety disappears on its own or not. The most obvious remedy would be to increase the dose of Venlafaxine by 37.5 mg and watch. Since we are not sure of the interaction yet, you could rather wait for a few days. If you can do a plasma drug level test of Venlafaxine, that would be great. Another thing to do would be an ECG and rule out QT interval prolongation by medicines, unlikely but better to rule out. In the worst scenario, if Venlafaxine has stopped working at 75 mg then you would be increasing the dose of Venlafaxine, but not looking for alternatives.

The pictures do not give me an exact idea because a sebaceous cyst is soft in consistency whereas molluscum is hard. If it is a sebaceous cyst, you should get it removed. A surgical excision by needling or radio frequency cautery is the treatment of choice. Molluscum contagiosum is caused by a virus and this lesion presents with a central umbilication, a depression similar to that of the navel. A white body is present in the bump. It is a contagious and sexually transmitted infection which can spread and form new lesions. The treatment plan will be needling to extrude the material inside and TCA cautery.

He vomited and had lot of salt water. Please advice for any side effect.","Doctor":"Hi. I want to assure you not to worry as everything is going to be fine if proper care and treatment is opted in for. I have thoroughly gone through your case and can well understand your genuine health concerns. 1. No, there is not much problem right now as he vomited and also had a lot of water. It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases. Because, it is a volatile compound and causes vapors entering the lungs through the airways. 3. As it was only two drops, I do not think it may cause much trouble. If he feels short of breath contact me back, otherwise fine. 1. He should avoid re-exposure. 2. Rule out if there is some sort of suicidal ideation due to depression or anxiety and take him to a psychiatrist for physical evaluation.

I used it for 30 days continuously, but no use. How many days should I take that powder and how to overcome this problem?","Doctor":"Hello. For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations. If the size and number of cysts are more, then I suggest consulting a gynecologist as you may require surgery. If the number and size of cysts are less, you may continue treatment along with syrup Evecare 10 ml BD and Kanchnar Guggulu two BD.

She had taken my blood sample and it was negative. But, still I have not gotten my periods and it has been a week ahead. What could be the reason for my late periods?","Doctor":"Hello. As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses.

I was two weeks into gestation, the cramping and bleeding started four hours later. I did pass out a few blood clots shortly after the cramps started. My concern is that the bleeding was not heavy at all that today the bleeding stopped. Is this normal? And does this mean that the abortion was successful? Are blood clots an indication that the pregnancy has ended?","Doctor":"Hi. Abortion will definitely cause bleeding more than normal periods. Passage of blood clots may just indicate the start of process of abortion and bleeding may continue for 5 to 7 days. It all depends on the quantity of blood clots you passed. If it was indeed excessive abortion might have been complete (which is rare, as bleeding generally lasts for a week or so). Just wait for a week and then you can decide further course of action depending on further bleeding."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I have -2.5 cylindrical in the right and -4 in the left eye and SPH is 4.75 in the right and 5 in the left eye.

No history of heart disease. My mother has COPD, but has been a long time smoker. Two and a half weeks ago, I went on a hayride with my sons. I have a short stature. To get on and off the hayride, I literally had to pull myself up onto the trailer. (Imagine pulling yourself out of a swimming pool). The next morning, I woke up with chest soreness. I had pain in the upper left chest area, a few inches to the left of sternum. That was a radiating pain over the breast towards armpit. Pain worsened on bending over. Also, I could locate very tender spots when pressing on the area with fingers. I had no pain during regular breathing, but very deep breaths caused pain to worsen (from the left of sternum radiating across and to the left breast). Over the past two and a half weeks, pain has improved, but still not completely subsided. Most of the pain (while bending) is gone, but I still have tender areas across upper left chest when poking around with finger (trigger points?). I have some minor discomfort on taking deep breath, but greatly improved from what it was. And now pain is just in an area to the left of my left breast. Now, pain is mostly towards armpit area and may be slightly radiating to the upper, bottom side of arm. I do not have much pain as it was in the beginning, but more of soreness. It is not constant, it occurs mostly just when I move in a certain way or tense my chest. Also I am noticing upper left back discomfort, not really pain. Local FNP suspects strained muscle. No x-rays were done. I have no cough, no shortness of breath, no loss of appetite, no indigestion or heartburn. Otherwise I feel fine. My concern is that I still have some pain and discomfort after almost 3 weeks. Shouldn't a muscle strain be healed by now? I am a bit concerned as it may be something more serious than a strained muscle, perhaps pleurisy or costochondritis?","Doctor":"Hello. You are right, muscular pain will not last so long. Pleurisy: Chostochondritis: Another possibility is that you might have a rib fracture. Start taking analgesic and hot fomentation 2-3 times a day for the painful region. Use a thoracic belt to restrict movements of the affected part.  Get a chest x-ray done immediately and revert back to a general practitioner online -->"},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I have multiple small cysts in both ovaries (PCOS). Our family friend suggested me to consume Kalarchikai medicine, powdered mixed with pepper and honey to have it for one mandalam (48 days). I have completed nearly 44 days by consuming one small ball of the mixture every morning and before two weeks I got my periods. Then I had checked whether the cysts were dissolved by having an abdomen scan. But still, small multiple follicules have been seen in it with both ovaries enlarged. Kindly suggest me what I can do further. I got married before one and a half years and I am much worried about my pregnancy. I have gallstones as well.","Doctor":"Hello. I just read your query. See Kalarachi Kai choornam is helpful in amenorrhea. As far as small cysts are concerned they are unmatured eggs which failed to induce menstrual cycle previously, as a result, they got collected in the ovary and they will remain in the ovary. Now, you have got your periods you can start trying for conception. But I advise you to do it under the supervision of a nearby gynecologist because egg size is important while conception and that you can know by ovulation study. Ovulation study is performed under the supervision of a gynecologist. For gall stones, surgical intervention is required generally. Medicine is not of much help."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am using a penile pump under the direction of a urologist. Over a period of each of five days, I think I had overstretched the penis and now have a loss of sensitivity and soreness with no erection. Do you know if it will and how long it may take to recover sensation and remove the soreness? What are the treatment options? The numb penis is very distracting. I am not sure how much damage the penile pump could cause. I am worried waiting too long. Thank you for your help.","Doctor":"Hello. A penile pump is a form of physical or mechanical treatment. Have you tried oral PDE5 (phosphodiesterase type 5) inhibitors like Viagra (Sildenafil)? It is not advisable to use a penile pump for long durations as any form of physical treatment is bound to cause some form of damage. I discourage you to use a penile pump as it has started to cause physical damage. Maybe your technique is wrong. Numbness and soreness are very common and it will revert back to normal but after how much time, it cannot be predicted. It may take four to six weeks. If you are interested, I can guide you in use of injection therapy in which you inject erection drugs with a small syringe in your penis before intercourse (you should not have any heart ailments for injection therapy).Injection therapy also has a few side effects. At present, you just discontinue using the pump and wait for it to heal. If you want you can continue using it provided you know the correct technique.

How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method.

Last week, my pain got worse with cramping over my pubic bone. Now, the discomfort and cramping comes in multiple places simultaneously (perineum, penis, rectum, and over the pubic bone), they get me very tired and stressed, and I tend to feel cold. I also feel pressure at the base of the penis and some pressure and itching in the urethra and outside the penis. I had not experienced pain in so many places before. I am quite concerned about this and do not know what is causing this. What will be the next line of action? In the past four months, I also noticed that from time to time, the veins in my urethra get darker and inflate slightly, changing the color of my urethra especially, if I sit down for a long time on an uncomfortable seat, is this normal? What could cause this? Does my MRI of pelvis show any abnormalities? I have also attached two figures of the urethra, and the images may not show the true color of the veins. Prostatitis symptoms like penile pain, pain during and after ejaculation, pain while starting urination, perineum pain, rectal pain, and lower back pain, started more than three years ago. Few months after a sexual encounter, I had a sharp feeling in the tip of the penis. The medications that I took are Cipro, Doxycycline, and Septrin. While taking these antibiotics, I only felt a slight improvement, and immediately symptoms returned after stopping the medication. I had to stop all antibiotics, due to adverse side effects (stomach related). Symptoms such as pain after ejaculation, pain in the perineum, and penile discomfort returned immediately after few days. But, after 3 to 4 weeks they became negligible. For next six months, my prostatitis related issues were minimal but it would flare up if I did any sports. During this time I had severe stomach issues (bloating, constipation, food sensitivities). As my stomach issues improved and as I got active, on one occasion while having sex I felt the same pinch in the tip of the penis, following this, in the course of two months all my symptoms were back. After this, I went through the discomfort for four months, during this time I realized that my semen's color has changed to yellow. Following this, I managed to reduce my discomfort by diet and avoiding sitting on normal chairs. Four months ago, my symptoms started again after a day of sitting on a normal chair for an hour followed by a sexual encounter, this time the symptoms did not leave. At this time, I started having pain after walking and also the sensation of an unemptied bladder a lot. I started undergoing internal pelvic floor therapy, which reduced some of my lower back pain; however, my pelvic floor became very sensitive, on two occasions some physical activities started horrible spasms in my pelvis for days. Four weeks ago, I sensed a pain over my pubic bone. However, last week after trying some Magnesium supplements, this pain increased. The next day after an ejaculation, my urethra was very sore, and at night the pain over the pubic bone came about, and it was awful. The day after, I was in a lot of pain, I could not stand up from the pain. Since then I feel multiple places spasm at the same time in my pelvis, pubic bone, the base of the penis, and lower abdomen, which triggers horrible sensation in my body.

Last July, I stopped, and then I started to have panic attacks with heart palpitation. I went to a cardiologist and everything was fine. But since then I became so anxious and I was aware of everything going on in my body. After that, I started to notice muscle twitching, in every muscle. At first, I thought it was a heart issue but after seeing three cardiologists the results were the same, my heart is fine. Then of course, I Googled it and I see some scary diseases like ALS. I went to a neurologist who, after some questions and examination said that it was due to an anxiety issue. To be sure he sent me to an institute specializing in the detection of neuromuscular disease, a neurophysiologist did a clinical examination (strength, reflex) and an EMG, and no abnormalities was showed, it were before three months. A month later, as my twitching was still going on, I went to another neurophysiologist, he did another EMG and again everything was normal. My neurologist said that it is impossible its ALS because muscle twitching for nearly eight months without any weakness. And I started to have so tingling and buzzing sensation. Again my neurologist said that it is very common with an anxiety disorder like mine. I started to take pills and to see a therapist for one month. I have to say that twitching is way better when my anxiety is low but sometimes it came back strong. I am so worried about ALS. My questions are: is EMG test reliable? Is it true that usually fasciculations come after or along with the weakness in ALS? Fasciculation for eight months without any weakness does rule out ALS? Does ALS cause pain?","Doctor":"Hi. I understand the problem you are facing, it is partly due to anxiety and partly due to nerve and muscle hyperactivity. Coming to your specific questions: Yes, fasciculations and weakness in ALS (amyotrophic lateral sclerosis) come together, actually, weakness comes first and fasciculations are generally unnoticed by patients, they are usually revealed upon asking or found by EMG (electromyography). EMG is reliable and diagnostic for ALS. Fasciculations without weakness ruled out ALS, eight months are a long duration for ALS, if it would have been ALS, it would have progressed to much extent. And ALS is painless, it is motor neuron disease, so the sensory system is perfectly normal. I would suggest you to try one tablet called Carnisure plus (contains Levocarnitin 500 mg and Methylcobalamin 1500 microgram). It is a vitamin for muscle and nerves, you can take it in the night daily for a few weeks and see the effect. Avoid coffee and other stimulants."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor,I am trying to conceive but my husband and I did cocaine a week ago. How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

He vomited and had lot of salt water. Please advice for any side effect.","Doctor":"Hi. I want to assure you not to worry as everything is going to be fine if proper care and treatment is opted in for. I have thoroughly gone through your case and can well understand your genuine health concerns. 1. No, there is not much problem right now as he vomited and also had a lot of water. It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases. Because, it is a volatile compound and causes vapors entering the lungs through the airways. 3. As it was only two drops, I do not think it may cause much trouble. If he feels short of breath contact me back, otherwise fine. 1. He should avoid re-exposure. 2.

I used it for 30 days continuously, but no use. How many days should I take that powder and how to overcome this problem?","Doctor":"Hello. For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations. If the size and number of cysts are more, then I suggest consulting a gynecologist as you may require surgery. If the number and size of cysts are less, you may continue treatment along with syrup Evecare 10 ml BD and Kanchnar Guggulu two BD.

She had taken my blood sample and it was negative. But, still I have not gotten my periods and it has been a week ahead. What could be the reason for my late periods?","Doctor":"Hello. As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses. For further information consult an obstetrician and gynaecologist online -->"},{"Patient":"Hello doctor,I am going to marry A-negative girl. And my blood group is B-positive. So, is there any complication or we can go ahead?","Doctor":"Hello. I have reviewed your query. To put it simply, persons of any blood groups can marry and have healthy children. But when the female is of negative blood group and male is of positive blood group (as in your case), the baby has a chance of having a positive blood group. This baby blood may pass through the mother’s blood through placenta, leading to formation of antibodies in mother’s blood and posing risk to further babies. But this is not much a problem, because this can be avoided by taking a RhIG injection during pregnancy and immediately after delivery. To conclude, you can marry a negative blood group girl, but you need to mention her Rh-negative blood group to your doctor immediately after the conception of pregnancy so that she can get her RhIG injection during and immediately after delivery.

It will reduce sebum production to decrease acne. Cosmelan is a peel used for pigmentation over the face. Use sunscreen daily to protect skin from sun exposure and good moisturizer to avoid dryness.

They did not take the glass out, and I have also been dying my hair since I was 16. I developed fibromyalgia from the wreck, which is supposed to be relatively non-progressive, however as the years went by I started experiencing debilitating neck pain paired with even worse migraines. I did stretching, physical therapy, chiropractor, and even medication, but nothing seemed to help. Last year, a pharmacy refused to refill my Tramadol. I was in such a debilitating pain that I went home and stared at where my headache was coming from, and I noticed my hair was growing funny in certain areas. So, I started to comb close to the scalp, and the hair that where my natural color started coming out of my scalp and pain started being relieved. I also noticed that rubberized glass was coming out of so many areas in my scalp. At this point, I could see all of the places where there was glass lodged and each time I shaved an area to get the glass out, the pain lessened in a way I will never even forget. I went and just shaved my head. After a few months, my scalp is so itchy, flaky, scaly, and pieces of glasses are still making their way out. So, I went to see a dermatologist, who said it is seborrheic dermatitis, but I have used everything you could use for that (Clobetasol, Ketoconazole, apple cider vinegar, Prednisone, some topical cream, Salicylic acid shampoo, tar shampoo, coconut oil, etc.). But still, I have to shave my head because my scalp is still very messed up. I think my follicles are damaged, so aside from getting injections at a dermatologist office, what treatments are available for that? Do you have a specific shampoo you recommend for repairing follicles?","Doctor":"Hi. The diagnosis from your history would still be seborrheic dermatitis or sebopsoriasis or scalp psoriasis. This is more of a cyclical problem, it tends to curb down with 2 to 3 months of treatment, but recurring back with a change in season or lifestyle. However, it naturally settles down as the age increases, usually around 30 to 35 years of age. The pain, as you describe, could even be neurogenic in view of a past history of trauma to the skin. This could damage the nerve fibers, which have a very slow tendency to regrow and recover, resulting in chronic pain. With regards to your scalp scaling, I would advise you to restart with a Ketoconazole, Zinc pyrithione, and coal tar combination shampoo. Initially, it would be recommended to start using it every alternate day for three weeks, with a gradual tapering in frequency. Thereafter, use it twice a week for next three weeks, and then weekly once for next three weeks along with the simultaneous introduction of your regular shampoo. In order to repair the damaged follicles, you could take oral supplements containing Biotin and Pantothenic acid, daily one tablet for a month. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicine after their consent. For more information consult a dermatologist online -->"},{"Patient":"Good day Doctors.

I contacted my psychiatrist about stopping the medication when I realized it had been prescribed for a condition that I do not have. My doctor was not open to this conversation and I unwisely decided to stop the medicine on my own. I did a fair amount of research prior to my titration and even went so far as to map out my titration schedule on a calendar. My main withdrawal concerns were anxiety, rapid heartbeat and insomnia. After a few days of titration when I realized I was not having any withdrawal effects I basically stopped cold turkey. About two weeks later, I experienced a weird cramping sensation in my hand. Based upon my rigorous physical activity, I assumed that I was dehydrated. The symptoms persisted for a few days and I decided to see a doctor. My laboratory reports ruled out an electrolyte imbalance, but I decided to start daily calcium and a multivitamin regimen at the recommendation of the doctor. Then, my symptoms have gotten out of control. I have had burning, pins and needles, tingling, numbness and cramping in both hands and feet. Recently, in the past few days, I have started to experience muscle twitches in both legs. I have seen a primary care physician and a neurologist. Also, I have had numerous laboratory tests and they were all normal. My electrolytes are good, no vitamin deficiency, liver and kidney function are good, thyroid good, no rheumatoid arthritis, no muscle wasting and I seemed to pass the in-office neurological examination. I feel like my electrical system has been misfiring for weeks. Every day, it is something different. In the past few months, I guess the good news (I think) is that the pain is less. But, what concerns me is that this is not stopping and now my legs are twitching. My neurologist seems to think this is all because I stopped Seroquel suddenly. In a sense, this is somewhat relieving. But, at the same time, I have not been able to find any other reports of similar withdrawal symptoms. I did not have any of the common withdrawal symptoms. My two main concerns are will this ever permanently stop? What happens if it continues to progress? Lastly, what else do I need to do to rule out the diagnoses? I am a very active and healthy 43 year old woman. I am not on any regular medication. I tend to agree with the neurologist's theory as the symptoms coincided with the termination of Seroquel. Aside from what I am experiencing now, the sickest I have ever been is when I had pneumonia. Please help me.","Doctor":"Hi. We are here to help you.

She was even hospitalized thrice and was on drips for stomach related diseases. Most often, her illnesses are related to stomach issues with symptoms typically including repeated vomiting, diarrhea and sometimes fever. Here in our place, the doctors are quick to prescribe a lot of medicine, often two antibiotics simultaneously. As I was concerned about all the medication that she has been on in the course of her life and about her general health and immunity, we decided to do a blood test the other day. Now, we would like to get some advice from a pediatrician on the results (attached), particularly in relation to her past consumption of medicine.","Doctor":"Hi. I have gone through your query and the reports (attachment removed to protect patient identity).

CBC showed low WBC, high monocytes, and high RBC, which is what made us scared. She has schistocytes and elliptocytes among other RBC morphologies. We read about it and are very worried, and she had a C-section three years back. Her iron is 13 ug/dL, iron binding is 484 ug/dL, iron saturation is 3 %, and ferritin is 3 ng/mL. I have attached her CBC report. Are her reports indicative of something serious? She also has pain between her legs and the pelvic area. She has vitamin D deficiency and vitamin B12 deficiency. She also had iron-deficiency anemia in the past, for which she took Ferrous sulfate. She is currently taking vitamin D and Thyrax medicines.","Doctor":"Hello. I have gone through your wife's reports (attachment removed to protect patient identity). The report shows schistocytes, which are fragmented RBC (red blood cell), commonly seen in hemolytic anemia. So, to rule out hemolysis, serum LDH (lactate dehydrogenase), reticulocyte count, and serum bilirubin should be tested. If hemoglobinopathy is suspected, then HPLC (high-performance liquid chromatography) can be done. As there is a history of iron-deficiency anemia (IDA), which decreases the iron level and increases TIBC (total iron binding capacity). So, treatment for IDA should be started with iron tablets like Ferrous sulfate or iron injections. Her monocyte count is slightly elevated, but absolute monocyte count is more important which is within the normal limits. Total WBC count is low, which can be due to any drug, infections like tuberculosis, typhoid, parvovirus B19, temporary infection, EBV (Epstein-Barr) virus infection, etc. Hence for that clinical examination and correlation has to be done. But in smear, no abnormal cells are seen, so there is nothing alarmingly wrong. Continue treatment for iron-deficiency anemia. Repeat peripheral smear after ten to twenty days and follow-up. Revert after twenty days to a hematologist online -->"},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I have experienced ringing in my right ear 3 days ago and it has not stopped since then.

Use resound relief app (android/iOS) on speaker with moderate sound during silence, because the inside sound must be bothering you during silence and sleep.

How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

I have thoroughly gone through your case and can well understand your genuine health concerns. 1. No, there is not much problem right now as he vomited and also had a lot of water. It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases. Because, it is a volatile compound and causes vapors entering the lungs through the airways. 3. As it was only two drops, I do not think it may cause much trouble. If he feels short of breath contact me back, otherwise fine. 1. He should avoid re-exposure. 2.

For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations.

As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves.

The pain is going up in my face to my head. Could you tell me what I can do? I have been taking Tylenol for pain.","Doctor":"Hi. You need not worry. Your chief complaint suggests pain in the upper right back region which is due to a carious tooth (attachment removed to protect patient identity). So as far your emergency is concerned, you are advised to use following medications: Amoxicillin-Clavulanic acid 625 mg TDS for five days, tablet Zerodol SP (Aceclofenac 100 mg plus Paracetamol 325 mg + Serratiopeptidase 15 mg) BD for three days but after food to avoid impact on stomach, take tablet Pantoprazole 40 mg OD for seven days, tablet Ketorolac 10 mg SOS. Place this tablet under tongue it will relieve your pain immediately. This is for emergency treatment. To address this problem properly, I suggest you after taking medication, go to the nearby dentist for restorative procedure or extraction. You are advised to take following precautions to prevent pain like salt gargles twice, do not bite on hard objects or use sugar-rich drinks for next one week. Keep mouth clean and rinse after eating so that food cannot lodge in the broken tooth."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor,I have composite veneers on both of my front teeth. Sometimes, if I sense my bottom teeth touching the bonded teeth, even lightly while eating or brushing or what have you, I worry that since enamel is stronger than the bonding material, this will somehow alter the bonding.

I spent a lot of money on the procedure and want to know what exactly would need to happen as far as my bottom teeth making contact with my top teeth in order to actually alter the appearance.","Doctor":"Hello. As far as normal occlusion or normal bite is concerned, the upper front teeth should not touch the lower front teeth. There should be a gap of at least 1 to 2 mm. But, sometimes when you are eating or trying to make the contact then it is absolutely normal. This way the bonding is not going to get affected. The doctors generally plan the treatment really well before giving the veneers. So, you need not worry about the bonding. Hope you got your answer. Regards.

My doctor says, it is vitamin B12 deficiency and the doctor has prescribed Vitamin B12 to take 1000 mg per day. My mother had MDS, diagnosed two years back and expired from it. My WBC counts recently in the past three months were 3.23 K/mcL, 3.13 K/mcL, 4.50-11.00 K/mcL, respectively.","Doctor":"Hi. I can understand your worries. First, it is of utmost importance to have a glass slide reviewed by a hematologist to check for the morphologic abnormalities, that is the dysplastic features of the cells. Not only it depends on the count, but also on the appearance of the cells that give the diagnosis of myelodysplasia. In your case, none of the absolute values of neutrophils, Hb or platelets qualifies for meeting the threshold criterion for MDS (myelodysplastic syndromes) (attachment removed to protect patient identity). These are called prerequisite criteria and they are Hb less than 110 g/L, neutrophils less than 1.5 g/L and for platelets less than 100 g/L. A glass slide review will also cover if any abnormal cells are present. If there are dysplastic features and abnormal cells present then, a further diagnostic workup is definitely needed. In your case, the prerequisite criteria are not met. If a glass slide has not been reviewed, I suggest to do it once. Secondly, it is important to check for hematinic deficiencies such as vitamin B 12, folic acid, and iron. You have your serum levels of folic acid checked, because you may be deficient, since, the folic acid normally does not have proper stores in the body. Your vitamin B12 is close to the lower limit, which means that there might be a functional deficiency, causing megaloblastic changes in the bone marrow and this may be the reason behind the low neutrophil counts. Consider intake of any medications, that may cause suppression of bone marrow. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents and Paracetamol are the reason behind the low count of neutrophils. I would consider these points before taking diagnostic work up to MDS. For more information consult a hematologist online -->"},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I am a 21 year old male.

During another relationship that I should have ended much sooner, the dosage was increased. I followed up with counseling, which was very helpful and lowered the dosage down to what my psychiatrist said was not really clinically high enough to do any good (100 mg and 25 mg), but he felt I should have something in my system in case I needed it and could build up to a higher dose quicker. I continued at this low dosage for several years and recently sought a second opinion and another psychiatrist said I should try going off the medication since the dosage was so low and my lab results showed very low levels of the Carbamazepine.

So, you need to change your lifestyle first and have regular exercise for two to three months and repeat lipid profile after that. If it is controlled on that we will continue the same or else we will start medicine after eight to 10 weeks. You should have a healthy lifestyle like avoiding fatty, oily and high-calorie diet. Regular exercises like brisk walking, jogging according to your capacity at least 30 minutes a day and five days a week. Lots of green leafy vegetables, fruits, fish once or twice a week, avoid meat. Avoid yellow part of eggs as it is rich in cholesterol. Avoid smoking and alcohol if any. There should not be abdominal fat deposition or obesity. Try to achieve BMI under 23. I think your elevated cholesterol should respond to dietary modifications. Your other symptoms are due to general weakness and lack of regular exercises but once get yourself examined by a local doctor for muscle power and reflexes just to be extra sure. Hope this helps you and get back if you have any doubts and also upload the lipid profile report.

Also, the doctor tried but the complications are not going.","Doctor":"Hello. You have not mentioned the age of your mother. Diabetic neuropathy is a common complication seen in patients who have long-term or uncontrolled diabetes. It may not be completely reversible. However, talk to your doctor about taking Vitamin B12 supplements and Gabapentin which may help relieve her symptoms to a certain extent. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines with their consent. These drugs have to be prescribed by your doctor after assessment of your mother's clinical condition. Also, consult a physiotherapist who could teach her some simple exercises to reduce the progress of neuropathy. Most important of all is to have blood sugar levels under good control and take care not to have any injuries.

I had mild fever with a very mild burning sensation on my penis for three days after that encounter. I consulted a doctor and she gave five shots of Ceftriaxone for five days. The mild burning sensation continued, but there were no warts or sores on the penis. I was negative for chlamydia and gonorrhea. The girl had colonies of candida albicans in her VDRL report. A month ago, there was a small sore on the foreskin of my penis and the very mild burning sensation was still there. I had to shift from the place because of my work and consulted a new doctor. The new doctor suspected it as herpes and gave me antivirals. That worked well for the mild feverish feeling which I used to have sometimes. I also used the cream Fucidin for the infection. However, the mild burning sensation still prevailed. I did tests for HIV, herpes, VDRL and urine routine last month, all of which were negative and normal. I consulted the previous doctor again over phone and she advised me a dose of Doxycycline for 14 days and Azithromycin for six days. I took the course and surprisingly the mild burning sensation was off. However, I started feeling a pain in my abdomen and lower abdomen. After four to five days of finishing the course, I still feel a pain in my lower abdomen (which I can feel in backside of the abdomen also). However, the infection on the penis seems to have subsided. Currently, I am taking one tablet of Azee for six days, Metrogyl three tablets a day for three days and Zocon 150 only once. I have no rashes or any other sores or warts on my penis or my body. The foreskin was a little tight after I stopped the Doxycycline on 14th day, but nothing is there on the penis head. It was only the foreskin which troubled me and the mild burning sensation and now it seems to be fine. It is only the pain on the abdomen and lower back troubling me now. What could be the reason for the pain?","Doctor":"Hello.

We have had a failed IVF and a failed frozen embryo transfer. One month back we had an IVF procedure and it has turned positive. Now we are in the fourth week. We are much concerned about the foods to eat and to avoid. Since we failed a couple of times, we are much concerned that any of our lifestyle habits will cause negative changes. We are taking green tea with ginger, lemon and honey for the past 3 years regularly and we consume non vegetarian food more of seafood. I read in some articles that, taking ginger and honey is not advisable during early pregnancy and also should avoid heat producing foods. So, we are much confused. Please advise regarding this issue.","Doctor":"Hi. The psychological as well as lifestyle changes will definitely affect the fetus (baby within the uterus). Generally, heat producing foods or activities lead to production of prostaglandins. These prostaglandins can disturb the uterus. Thus, certain foods have to be avoided. For example: groundnut, seasame, chicken, pineapple, pasalai keerai etc. Avoid white/brown sugar (from sugarcane). Use only palm jaggery or pure honey as a sweetening agent. First trimester (first three months of pregnancy) is the crucial period. Thus, if you feel/doubt something is not good, avoid it during the first three months. After that, the fetus is strongly implanted in the uterus and there would be no problem.  Daily walk in the evening is good during pregnancy. From the fourth month, you can perform yoga by consulting trained yoga teachers. Many more siddha drugs are available such as calcium and iron supplements. You can buy the following siddha drugs: Stay healthy.

I have seen a neurologist and talked to a few other medical specialists and none of them have any idea about my problem. It literally feels like there is something moving all around my brain. I got an MRI and it came back normal. So, my doctor said it was just anxiety. But, it is definitely not anxiety. Honestly, the symptoms feel like withdrawal and I have mentioned that to my doctors as well. But, they said if I stopped my medicines 2 years ago, then probably that is not the cause for my symptoms.

Is the pain in the scrotum or in the inguinal area? Is it in the suprapubic region? If you have pain in the right inguinal, there is a possibility of ureteric colic or appendicitis or ilium or cecal pain.  If you have pain in the center suprapubic, it is most commonly bladder infection. Sometimes pain around other organs may radiate here. If you have pain in the left inguinal region, it may be colitis, large bowel infection, obstruction or left ureteric colic etc. Scrotal pain like orchitis, epididymitis, torsion, varicocele etc. Consult your general surgeon and get one ultrasound of the abdomen and get treated accordingly.

He was admitted to a hospital, and the doctor examined my dad and told us that they need to perform a Whipple procedure on my dad. We did not ask for a second opinion, and we let them go ahead with the surgery. The operation took 13 hours, and he was hospitalized for 41 days after the surgery. He was finally discharged after 41 days, but he was suffering from stomachaches, arms pain, and fever. The biopsy report showed stage 1 pancreatic cancer, and the oncology doctor told us that chemotherapy is not required. He just told us that CA-19-9 test needs to be done every three months, for five years. My dad recovered, and he was on a normal diet.Last month, my dad started complaining about stomach pain, so we admitted him to the hospital again. After an endoscopy and CT scan, the doctor told us that there was some infection in the operated area and that antibiotics will cure it, and my dad will be released in two days. After two days, the doctor told that the infection was still there, so they need to admit him for two more days. But after four days, my dad started having a fever, vomiting, and shivering. So, the doctor changed his antibiotics and admitted him for three more days. We requested him to refer him to another hospital, but he said that he could handle my dad's case, and told us not to worry. On the tenth day, my dad was shifted to the ICU. My dad's nails and tongue changed to dark blue color, and the doctor told us that it was due to less blood flow. My dad was bleeding in the urinary tube, so we shifted him to the hospital where the Whipple was performed. Then my dad was again admitted to the ICU, and the doctors put him on a ventilator and other life supporting devices. The doctors informed us that he was suffering from multiple organs dysfunction. And the next day morning my dad passed away. I have enclosed CT, MRI, and other lab reports. How did my father die? What caused his death? Please help me. Thanks","Doctor":"Hi.

Moles are genetic collection of melanocytes which go through a cycle of emerging in childhood then become darker and fade by middle ages. In fair skin up to 50 are normal more than that increase the risk for skin cancer. And change in size, symmetry, color, symptoms also is a risk factor. Mole or nevi as called in medical term appearing in adult age like in you are always a risk factor. And in such an abrupt manner more so.

How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases.

For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations.

As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves.

The natural method of reducing these symptoms is by avoiding spicy food, eating your meals on time, and drinking adequate amounts of fluids to keep yourself hydrated. It is also important to make a food routine, which means you should have meals that are familiar to your body. Avoid surprising your body with new varieties of food suddenly. There is a probiotic medicine capsule Vibact IBS (Lactobacillus plantarum) which can be taken once daily for a month. This has shown relief in some of my patients with similar complaints.

He showed PaO2 levels of 60 mmHg in ABG at that time. But then we had a CT scan of lungs, which showed bilateral infection. But the doctor treating him took it lightly, and he was waiting for the swine flu report. H1N1 came back negative, yet his breathing became a major problem. All this happened within two days. He does not smoke or drink. He had a problem in breathing when he visited a hill station. On the second night, he was almost closing his eyes with a fever of 101 degree and PaO2 level of 54 mmHg. He was shifted to an ICU and was put on NIV. The next morning he did not improve, and his PaO2 level was 45 mmHg. So, we shifted him to a better hospital, who again put him in an isolated ward, as they also suspected H1N1. But, they diagnosed it as atypical pneumonia, as other parameters were normal. He was put on a ventilator, but here also his H1N1 report was negative, but the pulmonologist said that the pictures depict swine flu.

But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill.

For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations. If the size and number of cysts are more, then I suggest consulting a gynecologist as you may require surgery.

As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses.

That abrasion is also a cause for severe sensitivity to hot that you are having. Abrasion needs to be treated clinically with restoration. Once this pandemic of Covid-19 gets subside then you can get it treated in a dental clinic. For time being use Sensoform KF toothpaste. First, apply it on your teeth then keep it for 30-40seconds then brush it as you do daily. This is the way to use sensitivity toothpaste. Use mouthwash for gargling at least at night before going to bed after tooth brushing. For pain, if severe you can take Ultracet P or if not severe then can continue with Ultracet when needed.

I have lost 16 kilograms. I am eating about 700 to 900 calories per day. My usual food consists of breakfast with a small piece of fruit. My lunch contains fruits and vegetables. I take my dinner with a salad and steamed vegetables. I drink two liters of water per day. I go to the gym for five days a week, and I am doing exercise for 90 minutes. I am doing exercise for 10 to 15 minutes on the stationary bike. I am also doing 20 to 30 minutes of leg and butt workouts. I will finish my practice with light stretching.

But I am struggling to lose it. Is it right to take Duromine for losing weight?","Doctor":"Hi. You are taking an appetite suppressant and a low-calorie diet. You have hit the weight loss plateau. Suppressing the appetite is not good for health. Taking drugs can cause plenty of side effects. Hitting a weight loss plateau is quite excellent. It happens to almost everyone who tries to do it. Eating a very low-calorie diet is not healthy. One should not eat food less than their BMR (basal metabolic rate). Weight loss is not just about eating less. It is about eating the right quantity of food, without bothering too much about the calorie count. Try having intermittent fasting. Have 16 hours of gap between dinner and the next day breakfast. Eat a heavy meal in the morning (up to 600 grams). It can comprise three to four different types of fruits. Have a snack in the evening, which can be coconut water or lemon water, with 25 grams of nuts. For dinner, have green and starchy vegetables. Do not restrict the quantity. Eat until you feel full. Try to reduce taking Duromine (Phentermine) gradually."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I delivered a baby five weeks back. It was a normal delivery with episiotomy. My wound has healed now.

I would like to know how fast urushiol binds to skin, and once it does is there any possibility to spread? I use an electronic cigarette which requires me to handle cotton that I feed into the atomizer. My doubt is if urushiol vaporizes automatically, what will be the harm?","Doctor":"Hello. I have read your query. Poison oak causes allergic contact dermatitis (ACD) and is the most common cause of ACD than all the other causes combined. The allergen which cause ACD is usually present within the sap named urushiol and it will be mainly present in the leaves and the inner stems of the plant. After the contact with any part of the plant it usually takes 12 - 48 hours for the symptoms to occur. But the resin will bond immediately to the skin on contact. So, you should remove it with a mild soap wash immediately. If within 10 - 15 minutes of contact washing is done, 50% can be removed. But, if it is beyond one hour, washing does not help much. You can use Bentonite barrier creams which can prevent bonding of urushiol to your exposed parts. Urushiol once bound to the skin does not vaporize and does not spread to other parts of the body. As it is a local reaction, the intensity of it depends on the amount of resin contacted.

There is a 30-year-old obese female with no known history who comes to the emergency room. She presents with a 2-month history of shortness of breath and pedal edema. When she comes to the emergency room she is found to be in a hypertensive emergency with pressures of 190/110. She was given Lasix in ER and her pressures responded well. CT angio chest and CXR showed mild pericardial and b/l pleural effusions. Her BNP was elevated at 1000. An echo was done which showed LVEF of 20 to 25 % with severe concentric LVH. The echo showed dilated cardiomyopathy. Given her age group, we did an extensive workup for her HTN and her CHF, including lupus, RA, viral antibodies, (echo adenovirus), b/l renal artery stenosis, fibromuscular dysplasia, pheochromocytoma, etc. Everything was negative. It seems that she may have had severe diastolic dysfunction due to underlying untreated HTN which was undiagnosed. But my question is the systolic heart failure with dilated cardiomyopathy. What explains that in this lady? Can hypertension in itself cause dilated cardiomyopathy? If so, would the echo show both a dilated LV and severe concentric LVH? Or is it that she may have had a viral infection of some sort which slipped her into dilated cardiomyopathy and caused her to go into HF? I know this is a medical question and I am not giving the full information but I would love if you can explain this to me. Thanks.","Doctor":"Hello. She is having HTN (hypertension) which may cause concentric LVH (left ventricular hypertrophy). EF (ejection fraction) 20 to 25 % with both pericardial and bilateral pleural effusion. You need to evaluate the cause of effusion both cardiac and pleural and need to exclude tuberculosis and underlying hypoproteinemia. You may do TB PCR (tubercular PCR), LFT (liver function test).

How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off.

The period itself was odd and concerning, I bled for 11 days, and the last five days being very heavy. I have never bled more than seven days before. Now, I am on the 37th day of the cycle but still did not get my period. I am getting nervous. Could my hormones still be messed up from the supplement, that I stopped a month ago? I have also been off my antidepressants (Wellbutrin and Lexapro) for a month, after taking them almost half of my life. Could that affect my cycle? Am I going into menopause on the strike of my 37th birthday? Can it be a cyst or cancer?","Doctor":"Hi. In the meantime, please stay calm.

Summer has started where I live, and I am addicted to playing cricket, whatever the weather or climate be. From last two weeks, I have noticed that my face color has become darker due to the sun. So, I am a little confused about which sunblock cream to use. I need your suggestion on which cream to use. I do not understand the concept of SPF 25, 30, 50 and 60.","Doctor":"Hi. Sun protection factor or SPF blocks damaging UV rays, which are responsible for skin aging, darkening, sunburn, and malignancy. I would advise you to use sunscreens that are a multi-spectrum or broad spectrum, which blocks both UV-A and UV-B rays. Select Sunscreen according to SPF value. SPF number not less than 30 and not more than 50 will serve the purpose. While going to play, you may apply a generous layer of SPF 50, and for the routine purpose, you may use SPF 30. Do drink plenty of fluids and wear protective cotton clothing particularly light-colored clothes. Take care. Have a nice and safe game.

It all started with a severe panic attack then I was diagnosed with acute hypochondriac. I have been always worrying about my heart health and fearing that any time I may get an attack. This has reduced my quality of life considerably. I am on Paroxetine CR 12.5 mg one tablet a day for the past one year and it does helped me to cope up with my fear. I feel normal now but could not stop Paroxetine. I am getting withdrawal symptoms like dizziness, racing heart beat and high BP. I would like to gradually taper Paroxetine. Is Prozac a better option?

How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

I have thoroughly gone through your case and can well understand your genuine health concerns. 1. No, there is not much problem right now as he vomited and also had a lot of water. It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases. Because, it is a volatile compound and causes vapors entering the lungs through the airways. 3. As it was only two drops, I do not think it may cause much trouble.

For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations. If the size and number of cysts are more, then I suggest consulting a gynecologist as you may require surgery.

As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves.

This is likely to be a prolapse, either an anal or rectal prolapse or prolapse of hemorrhoids. Definitive treatment is the surgicalcorrection if it is severe. Otherwise, you should put it inside manually after passing stools. It may come back again during straining at stools. So every time it comes out, you need to put it back.  I guess you do not have any bleeding. The most important thing to prevent its progression is to avoid excessive straining at stool.

Bloating may also occur secondary to constipation. Your reports are fine (attachment removed to protect patient identity), but cholesterol is a bit elevated and you should get a complete lipid panel done and continue a healthy lifestyle. You should avoid fatty, oily and spicy diet. Have a walk after having food instead of taking rest. Have multiple small meals instead of heavy meals. Have regular sleep habits and avoid stress. Lots of green leafy vegetables and fruits. Avoid smoking and alcohol if any. I suggest tablet Pan DSR (Pantoprazole-Domeperidone combination) 40 mg or Esomeprazole-Domperidone combination before breakfast once a day for two weeks. If not adequately relieved, then you should try adding syrup Sucral-O (Sucralfate-Oxethazaine combination) or Gelusil (Aluminium hydroxide and Magnesium hydroxide) two teaspoons three times a day for a week. For immediate pain relief, you can have antispasmodic like tablet Dicyclomine 20 or Hyoscine 10 mg whenever needed up to three times a day.

The common cold is a viral infection that lasts for days, not years. To treat the common cold, you need to take rest, good hydration, nasal decongestants, panadol cold and flu (Paracetamol, Pseudoephedrine hydrochloride and Dextromethorphan hydrobromide), an antihistamine like Zicam (Zinc acetate and Zinc gluconate).

There could be additionally middle ear block or eustachian tube block as the pressure change worsening it. However, since you have not mentioned the duration, I am mentioning all possible differentials. Recurrent vertigo lasting under one minute is usually benign paroxysmal positional vertigo. A single episode of vertigo lasting several minutes to hours may be due to migraine or transient ischemia of the labyrinth or brainstem. The recurrent episodes of vertigo associated with Meniere's disease or recurrent vestibulopathy also typically last hours, but can be briefer. Further evaluation need local examination by an ENT surgeon. I suggest you Betahistine 8 mg three times a day for symptom relief.

How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases.

The thing I am scared about is, my doctor asked me why my ferritin has not increased (just the opposite, it has decreased from 5.79 to 5.77) after three months of taking iron supplements. My other iron levels are at 39 which has increased considering those references. But, that was probably because I did not use the medicine correctly, I was only taking 5 mg a day. Another thing I am worried about is, my lymphocytes kind of got increased in my blood: (52.8) - the reference is 19.4 to 44.9, and the other one is 3.57. My neutrophils kind of decreased too (36.9) and the reference was between 41.0 to 73.0. In the last week, I had a viral infection as both my parents were sick. Is it why my levels got high? My WBC is 6.77 and RBC is 4.52. My hemoglobin is also increasing actually, last time I checked, it was 11.0 and now it is 11.2. Still low, but it was good to see that it was increasing. My thrombocyte levels got higher again, unfortunately. The first time I was told that I was anemic, my thrombocyte levels were on 485, then in my second blood test (after using iron supplements correctly it decreased to 380. And yesterday, when I checked, it increased to 435 (reference is 156 to 373). I was also told that I have an infection in my urinary system and he gave me antibiotics. Honestly, I have been always getting suspected about it since my anemia has started. Should I be worried about my condition or is it normal?","Doctor":"Hello. In viral infection, lymphocytosis means increased lymphocytes and neutrophil is relatively low because of increased lymphocytes. Platelet can be high in iron deficiency anemia. It is not a matter of worry just now. You can provide your reports to guide you further. Your hemoglobin level is mildly low and you should be given a good iron-containing medication like Ferrous ascorbate (brand name Orofer that contains 100 mg elemental iron). It should be taken without break for the prescribed duration. The underlying cause for iron deficiency anemia also should be ruled out like bleeding, parasites infestation, etc. Repeat your CBC after a few days.

Whatever treatment you undergo, smoking is going to degrade it, and you will ultimately get stains again (in this case). I might sound rude here, but you have to stop smoking. You have to gradually decrease smoking and then totally stop. Otherwise, let alone the cancer part, it will definitely cause stains and degrade your gums and teeth health too.

I cannot tell if I am straining it every time or if it is just knots and trigger points. So, I do not know whether to apply heat or ice. I am just taking Ibuprofen. A few years ago, I pulled that muscle pretty badly. It took a few weeks to heal. Since then, I have had these flare ups. It is never as bad as that pull and they have lasted now for two to five days. This morning, while getting out of bed, I felt the spasm or a knot or strain. I tried to ice it, but I think it made it worse. Is hot fomentation safe? Does it sound like a strain or pull or a recurring knot?","Doctor":"Hi. 1. Repetitive strain injury of the rhomboids due to continually working with an outstretched arm similar to working with a computer mouse. This especially when the mouse is far off on the table. 2. It may be due to a faulty ergonomic posture adopted by you during some work that resulted in a rhomboid muscle strain. 3. It may be due to referred pain from stomach problem like ulcers. 4. May be a strain in the corresponding thoracic segment of the spine. Usually not needed in the early stages of treatment. Rhomboid muscle strain. Thoracic segment of spine strain. Rhomboid muscle strain. 1. Apply heat in the part as ice pack does not make you comfortable. 2. Take the medications regularly. 3. Strengthen the rhomboid muscle group after the pain comes down to rest and medications. A theraband strengthening program for the rhomboids will help especially with the easiest color red. 4. Taping to prevent overstretching of the rhomboid muscles and to provide proprioceptive feedback will help. 5. Rest the part. 1. Do not massage the painful part. 2. Ensure that you keep your elbow close to your waist as you position yourself to do any activity. That will safeguard your rhomboids from further injury. 3. Do not try to examine yourself about the pain in the rhomboids. Your attempts may make it worse.

The stability of the patient's condition depends on whether this was his first attack of angina and it occurred while at rest or during physical exertion. It also depends on whether his ECG was normal or abnormal and the cardiac enzymes excluded a heart attack or not. We also need to look into the presence of diabetes, hypertension or any other disease. In the absence of the aforementioned information, I will recommend that the patient beshifted after five to six days if he does not have a recurrence of angina and once he is on anti-angina treatment.

I am having an ear block issue even after swimming. Is there anything I can do at home? Or do I need to visit a doctor?","Doctor":"Hello. The wax has absorbed the cleaning fluid and got swollen blocking the ear canal. It is common. The block is transient and you keep putting the drops as advised by the ENT doctor. Usually we put drops for 4 to 5 times daily for five to six days and then go back to the clinic for wax removal. Wax drops are advised to make the wax softer and help remove the ear wax without pain and also to remove completely. If you have not been advised by a doctor to use wax drops and you have self-medicated yourself, then it is better to consult an ENT doctor immediately as we do not know what exactly has caused the ear block. Wax drops should not be used in the ears with otitis media (middle ear infection) or otitis externa (infection of the ear canal).

When I started Cipralex 10 mg I was fine. However, when my depression worsened I was given Mirtazapine 30 mg and my weight increased a lot. I gained 15 kg in three months, mostly around my belly and hip. I consulted a psychiatrist on icliniq and he changed my medicine from Mirtaz 30 mg to Topomax 100 mg. I lost 10 kg in three months with Topomax and stopped it eventually. Nevertheless, my weight has started increasing drastically around belly and hips (after I stopped Topomax). I feel bulky and the tummy is growing out. It is so embarrassing as I am a lean guy and with belly protruding out, I am going low on confidence.

When I went to the toilet today, there was quite a lot of bright red blood. I went again and sat on the toilet without actually doing anything, and there was more blood. I have had cramps as well. Should I be worried right now? I have had bowel problems for like three months.","Doctor":"Hello. For more information consult a general practitioner online -->"},{"Patient":"Hello doctor,I am trying to conceive but my husband and I did cocaine a week ago. How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

I have thoroughly gone through your case and can well understand your genuine health concerns. 1. No, there is not much problem right now as he vomited and also had a lot of water. It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases.

For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations. If the size and number of cysts are more, then I suggest consulting a gynecologist as you may require surgery.

She had taken my blood sample and it was negative. But, still I have not gotten my periods and it has been a week ahead. What could be the reason for my late periods?","Doctor":"Hello. As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses.

My last menses was on the 16th of previous month which was about a week earlier than the before periods. I was diagnosed with autoimmune hepatitis and under medication of steroid 10 mg (prescription attached). Now I am completely normal and my last LFT test was completely under the limit. Please inform me whether the delay of menses is due to the side effect of steroids or due to other reasons. Is it a serious worrying issue?","Doctor":"Hello. I have gone through your history and also saw the prescription you uploaded of your recent visit to your hepatologist/gastroenterologist. (attachment removed to protect patient identity).  As I can see from the prescription he had asked you to continue the medications you were taking for autoimmune hepatitis which includes immunosuppressants like steroids (Omnacortil) and Azathioprine. Let me tell you that chronic steroids therapy can hamper with your menstrual cycles by disturbing the regulatory hypothalamo-pituitary-ovarian axis. So what I mean is it is common to have disturbed cycles when you are on chronic steroid therapy. So most likely that is the cause for delayed cycles, as I see even your thyroid level (TSH) appears to be within the normal range, (although close to the higher side of normal range). Please do not worry or panic as there is nothing grossly serious to worry about. As of now you will most likely be requiring this treatment and will take some time to wean off from these medications as they are more important medication, saving your life from redevelopment of autoimmune hepatitis. So, please continue these medications as advised by your gastroenterologist. Cycles should mostly resume or get regularized once you are slowly taken off from the steroids.

I underwent my pelvic scan today and it says I have no gestational sac and have a thick endometrium. I have very mild bleeding for the past two days and slight press on my right lower abdomen. My doctor has suggested me to take hCG at a lab and I was also told my periods will come anytime. My concern is that I have a flight journey of seven hours in another 48 hours. Is it safe to travel? What are the precautions that I need to exercise?","Doctor":"Hello. You can definitely take a long flight. What you had was a biochemical pregnancy meaning pregnancy hormones only in blood and urine and not on the scan. Urine pregnancy is positive when the blood level of beta hCG (human chorionic gonadotropin) hormone is 25 IU/mL. But only if the baby is healthy and gets a good place to sit in the uterus, will it produce the beta hCG at the expected rate and only when the level is more than 1500 IU/mL, it can be seen on the scan. As pregnancy was not so healthy, urine pregnancy test was weakly positive and I am sure the beta hCG will be negative or very low as it is supposed to be more than 3000 IU/mL at six weeks. You might have taken some hormone pills for pregnancy growth. This along with hormone form failing pregnancy will make endometrium thicker. If you do not want to have the bleeding during the flight, you can continue hormones like Duphaston (Dydrogesterone) twice a day until you reach the destination. After few days of stopping the pills, you will have thick fleshy bleeding with clots. There is nothing to worry about. If you do not mind the bleeding, keep a few extra pads handy. You can also take some antispasmodic medicines like Cyclopam (Dicyclomine and Paracetamol) or Spasmo Proxyvon (Dicyclomine, Paracetamol, and Tramadol) or Hyocimax (Hyoscine butylbromide) or Drotin (Drotaverine) two to three times as a precaution. Some may have slightly painful lower abdominal cramps. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and with their consent take the medicines. You need to have a lot of fluids, water, juices, tea, and coffee. Try to relax whenever possible. You may feel the tiredness which is seen during normal periods. Regards.

As partner status is unknown and has high-risk factors, it is better to use prophylactic treatment. Secondly, pain in armpit has almost no relation to STD. It is probably myalgia and it may be exaggerated by stress and fear. Are you having any ulcers on the penis or surrounding skin or had shaved before the act?

His height is good around 5 feet 7 inches and weight 84 kgs. Looks overweight. He exercises around 45 minutes five days a week and eats junk only twice a week. Please advice. What should I do about the above?","Doctor":"Hi. All of these symptoms are suggesting metabolic-X syndrome. In the long run, if not controlled then there is a high risk of developing complications, like diabetes and heart problems. The best suggestion I can give is to see a good endocrinologist and follow up with him, as he needs to be tested for hormones like cortisol, thyroid, androgens. Cut back on junk, not even once a week. It is poison for him. Continue exercise, fast walking, not jogging. With this weight, jogging can be harmful for joints. Anti-cholesterol medications are usually started after 18 years of age, I would not recommend starting right away. Fatty liver grade 1 is totally reversible with weight management, I would suggest do caloric count per day. Do not let him take 2000 KCal in a day, Everything more than that gets deposited in form of fat. Use more proteins than carbohydrates. Repeat ultrasound liver in six months to see the resolution of fatty liver status. For more information consult a family physician online -->"},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, My BP is normal. But when I go to a doctor, my BP becomes high. I checked for two times, and my BP was found to be high. I am not taking any medicines. My ECG is normal. How can I reduce my BP? Please suggest.","Doctor":"Hi. The standard BP (blood pressure) ranges between 110 by 70 mmHg to 120 by 80 mmHg. I think your BP is within the range and any reading above this normal range is considered to be abnormal or high. High BP can be temporary or transient depending upon the triggers. A person can have high blood pressure if the BP remains consistently and persistently high for one to two weeks. In this case, tests like ECG (electrocardiography) can be done before the medications are given. You can reduce blood pressure by reducing the intake of salt, fatty foods, do a lot of exercises, and have a good sleep. Be relaxed."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, My husband and I had protected sex on the 15th of the month. I have taken an I-pill on the 17th. There is no withdrawal bleeding yet. I was worried about a pregnancy as there was some pre-ejaculate involved. So, I took a pregnancy test and it came back negative. Now, when can I expect my period? Or is there still a chance I am pregnant?","Doctor":"Hello. Since you have taken an emergency contraceptive pill within 72 hours of intercourse, there is no chance of pregnancy. The delay could be because of hormonal changes due to the pill you have taken. Wait for another week or so, and repeat the test with an early morning urine sample to ensure that you are not pregnant. By then, you should be getting your periods. However, if you have a doubt, then get back to me. Take care.

Also, it feels like it's clogged inside. Last month my other felt like this too, I had to take medication for it.","Doctor":"Hi! There are only 3 possibilities with the complaints you have mentioned. 1. Impacted wax in the left ear which is causing pain and a blocked feeling For this, you can use wax solvents which liquify the wax and resolve the issue 2. Infection involving your outer ear, which can be the cause of itching and pain 3. Eustachian tube catarrh which is associated with allergy and usually does present with only feeling of pain and blocked sensation The treatment you would have taken earlier using anti allergic would have been to treat the eustachian tube catarrh. You can consider taking a combination of paracetamol with fexofenadine / montelucast/levocetricine/ phenylephrine combination whichever is available in your country. In addition you can use ciplox ear drops 3 drops 3 times a day. If your having allergic issues, it has be effectively treated to prevent recurrence of such episodes. However, if the above treatment does not work , consider meeting an ent specialist to get your ear examined and get treated accordingly."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I had gestational diabetes during my pregnancy.

The common cause of enlarged lymph nodes is tuberculosis or lymphoma or other malignancy. The radiologist (who has seen your nodes) can make better comments (on the basis of the appearance of the nodes).

You may discuss with the radiologist about the appearance of the nodes or may wait to repeat the ultrasound after three months.

How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

He vomited and had lot of salt water. Please advice for any side effect.","Doctor":"Hi. I want to assure you not to worry as everything is going to be fine if proper care and treatment is opted in for. I have thoroughly gone through your case and can well understand your genuine health concerns. 1. No, there is not much problem right now as he vomited and also had a lot of water. It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases. Because, it is a volatile compound and causes vapors entering the lungs through the airways. 3. As it was only two drops, I do not think it may cause much trouble. If he feels short of breath contact me back, otherwise fine. 1. He should avoid re-exposure. 2. Rule out if there is some sort of suicidal ideation due to depression or anxiety and take him to a psychiatrist for physical evaluation.

For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations. If the size and number of cysts are more, then I suggest consulting a gynecologist as you may require surgery. If the number and size of cysts are less, you may continue treatment along with syrup Evecare 10 ml BD and Kanchnar Guggulu two BD.

She had taken my blood sample and it was negative. But, still I have not gotten my periods and it has been a week ahead. What could be the reason for my late periods?","Doctor":"Hello. As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses.

Blood tests show that his lymphocytes abs is 5.71 before six months, and 5.35 before three months. (Compared to the normal range that came with the results which is 1.30-3.60 x 10^9/L). Do you think is there something to be worried about?","Doctor":"Hello. I reviewed the records. (attachment removed to protect patient identity).  Having more lymphocyte count is known as lymphocytosis. 1. Benign or reactive lymphocytosis: Transient nature can be seen in an infectious disease like viral illness. This does not seem to be the case as it persists for a few months. Other causes, that could persist are noninfectious causes like stress, drug reaction, having spleen removed in the past, etc. 2. Malignant lymphocytosis: There is an entity called chronic lymphoproliferative disorders (CLPD), this is a very slow-growing blood malignancy, usually happens in individuals more than 60-65 years. Some times patients do throw symptoms like low-grade fever, weight loss, anemia, night sweats, etc. They may or may not be associated with low platelet count to anemia which is not the case with your friend. With all this background knowledge, please see which ones is fitting for him. I will discuss the worse scenario because I guess you will be curious otherwise. Having CLPD is less likely as your friend is young, and he is not having anemia or low platelet counts. Regarding the CLPD prognosis, it is one of the very slow-growing entity. We do not treat the early stages, as well as they, are so slow, treating has more drug side effects than the CLPD itself. Getting a flowcytometry is rational in his case. But it is not urgent, you can wait for even few months if there is an issue of lockdown due to Coronavirus. Again, I am not saying he has any particular disease, but I want to explain everything in detail so that you have a good understanding."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, My age is 30.

The continuous bleeding in the form of heavy bleeding and clots indicate that abortion has been incomplete and still products of conception remain in the uterus.

The tooth pain on tapping suggests some infection in the tooth, or any food getting stuck between two teeth, sudden biting of any hard food, maybe if any abnormal biting of teeth and so on. There are many reasons for this. So we have to make sure what caused you the so called pain on tapping. Good that you did not have any pain thereafter. Just check out if you have decay in that tooth.

Yesterday, I tried to feel for one again and felt something that could be similar. I do not remember feeling that before but I am not very familiar with that area. I could not work my finger around it, so my insides it must be smelling. Today, I cannot even fit my finger in. There is no pain when I press my abdomen. When I drink milk or something, there is no pain, maybe a little bit of bloating, similar to having my period. I have a slight soreness in my middle right back and It does appear like I am seeing more when I look down there. I have made a doctor appointment for tomorrow and I am not sure if it is more serious than waiting.","Doctor":"Hello. I do not see it a reason to worry about. As you mentioned, it could be a forgotten tampon. But chances are low as it would have interfered with your sex. It would have been painful. The other possibility is there may be an infection of vagina and cervix. Cervix can feel as a swelling in the midline and when infected, it can be felt slightly bigger than normal. It may produce a discharge that could be white, yellow, grey, or brownish, which can be foul smelling or fishy smell or with itching, feverish feel, and pain in lower back. In either of these situations, you have to consult a gynecologist who needs to do an internal examination. evaluate and give you a course of antibiotics. Do not keep examining the vagina.

She is unable to sleep due to the pain. All ANC check and blood tests are fine. This is the second pregnancy. She has complaints of a lot of pain in her legs on both sides, more on the right leg. She says she is unable to sleep due to pain. We complained to her obstetrician and she at that time said that such a pain is not expected. However following two to three days, now the pain is persisting and making her life difficult. We have now temporarily traveled away from her doctor. So, I need some help. She has some tenderness in the lower back though not significant. These are similar but less severe complaints before pregnancy. Kindly suggest treatment. Of note, she has taken Paracetamol once, but with minimal relief only.","Doctor":"Hello. To tell you the truth, I need more information or examine the patient to come to an accurate diagnosis. Differential diagnosis includes vascular problems for which we can consider a venous/arterial doppler. Probable diagnosis is a pregnancy-related lumbar strain which is less likely. We need to check for her peripheral pulses and also need to do some basic blood tests to check for any inflammatory markers. She needs CBC (complete blood count), ESR (erythrocyte sedimentation rate), CRP (C-reactive protein), uric acid, calcium, RA (rheumatoid arthritis) factor, RBS (random blood sugar), RFT (renal function tests), vitamin D3, vitamin B12, and MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) of the lumbar spine (If required). Firstly, we need to check if the leg pain is associated with any tingling or numbness. If her mild back pain with both side leg pain is associated with tingling and numbness, it could be a lumbar disc problem/herniation. For this, we need to consider a lumbar spine MRI (magnetic resonance imaging). Secondly, if it is mainly leg pain, we can treat it conservatively with medications and physical therapy. So once the pain settles, she can learn pregnancy-related lumbar stretch and gentle back strengthening exercises from a good physiotherapist. She can continue tablet Paracetamol 1000 mg twice a day one in the morning and evening after food times one week until the pain subsides. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and with their consent take the medicine. She needs to prevent lifting heavy weights, bending forward, jerky travel and strenuous work. She needs a firm bed mattress. Followup depends on improvement. If she does not improve, she needs to consult a pain management or an orthopedic doctor.

My tooth was extracted yesterday, still bleeding heavily. I had fever through the day.","Doctor":"Hello. Most dentists will offer pain medications if the procedure can reasonably be expected to cause pain that cannot be managed by OTC medication. In your case, I wonder why he has not prescribed any because extracting a third molar root can be a little difficult and the patients will feel pain and discomfort for two to three days. I suggest your dentist should have prescribed antibiotics like Amoxicillin 500 mg three times daily for three days and analgesics like Ibuprofen or Acecloparacetamol combination three times daily for three days. You should definitely check with your dentist about the medication. Some reasons why he has not given could be because of the stress the analgesics will cause to your liver when taken in overdose as I can see you have already taken some painkillers in the past. Or maybe he might have quickly taken the roots of your molar out and was expecting a quick healing. Anyway, if you still have pain you should definitely go back and check with your dentist.

For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations. If the size and number of cysts are more, then I suggest consulting a gynecologist as you may require surgery. If the number and size of cysts are less, you may continue treatment along with syrup Evecare 10 ml BD and Kanchnar Guggulu two BD.

She had taken my blood sample and it was negative. But, still I have not gotten my periods and it has been a week ahead. What could be the reason for my late periods?","Doctor":"Hello. As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses.

I just received the results from blood tests taken a week back and I am a bit concerned about my fasting glucose level. On this most recent test, my fasting glucose was 103 mg/dL. I had a full physical eight months back. At that time my fasting glucose was only 86 mg/dL. This rapid rise is of great concern to me as my mother has type 2 diabetes. The doctor did not request an HbA1c test. But, my cholesterol levels were good. Total cholesterol was 185. Triglycerides were 115, which was higher than the previous test. Then they were 73. Also, I am 6 feet tall. My current weight is 200 pounds. My weight earlier was 190. Current waist circumference at widest point is 38 inches. I am very physically active, exercising for an hour at least five days each week. I thought my diet was generally good. I do drink alcohol but rarely more than 2 or 3 beers once or twice each week. Here are my questions. How concerned should I be about the rise of my fasting glucose level? Could this result be in error due to anxiety or drinking alcohol a few nights prior? Could gaining 10 pounds in six months have led to this increase in fasting glucose? What should my next step be? I do not want to develop diabetes like my mother.","Doctor":"Hello. Firstly, we do not rely so much on a single report. Because, there are multiple factors which may affect the fasting readings like as you mentioned stress level, alcohol, diet on the previous day, etc. So you need to check it again after an interval of two weeks. Also, weight gain of pounds can also raise your level to some extent by increasing insulin resistance, so there must be a component of true elevation as well. Your triglyceride level is also increased which goes in hand with your weight so need to have a control over diet. So this elevation is also subjected to various factors like whether fasting or not, previous date meals, etc., to some extent, but there must be true elevation as well as your weight has also increased. So, the fasting is elevated a bit but within normal range only (less than 110). So you need to take all precautions to prevent further rise. So important is diet and exercises. You should try to achieve some weight loss at least. Diet low in calories, fatty and oily component, an excess of green leafy vegetables, and fibers will help in controlling both levels. Also, less of refined carbohydrates and soft drinks. Try to keep alcohol consumption at the lowest level. No smoking, if you do."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I am 68 years old.

He is not adding enough weight, he has catarrh, and the skull at the forehead is not yet closed. He is currently taking Encephabol syrup 1 ml a day.","Doctor":"Hello. I have thoroughly reviewed your query. Baby being floppy can be due to various causes ranging from cerebral palsy, muscle disorders, infections affecting the brain, brain damage due to low oxygen and even brain damage due to jaundice may also cause floppy baby. Brain damage due to jaundice may even cause the baby to have a decreased appetite. I advise you to immediately take your baby to a pediatrician or a pediatric neurologist and get him evaluated immediately.

How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases.

He does not feel bloated nor pain in his stomach. Whenever he burps he does not even feel acid in his throat. The burping does not bother him much, and the frequency has reduced.","Doctor":"Hello. Thanks for providing a detailed history of your son. This excessive burping usually occurs due to aerophagia. Patient is usually not aware of it and they swallow a lot of air during eating or drinking. We normally swallow a little air and we sometimes have one or two burps in routine but those who swallow more air have more burping. Coming to his lab tests, this A/G ratio is not that significant and his Vitamin D should be replaced. Both these tests are not associated with burping. He has no alarm sign so endoscopy is not mandatory and he can avoid it. His endoscopy report will be most probably normal. He needs diaphragmatic exercises to avoid burping. The way forward is that after eating or drinking he should hold a pencil in his teeth and take a deep breath via nose and exhale via mouth for about five minutes and it will help out.

I tried to rest my voice and did continuous steaming. But it is impossible to not talk because I have a day job that involves talking to clients. I am unable to sing now. I do not know up to what extent my voice is damaged?","Doctor":"Hi. First and foremost, acute inflammation of the vocal cords what we call acute laryngitis requires proper precautionary measures for a certain amount of time with proper treatment failing of which the problems will recur again after a short span of relief. My advice to you would be to give an absolute voice rest for the next 10 to 14 days. Now absolute voice rest means you should not even be saying yes/no during the day. If your work involves the use of your voice I advise you to take complete off from your job for the next 10 to 14 days. The vocal cords require time to heal completely and this takes usually 10 to 14 days. Your voice might return to normal in five to six days, however, there is always a hidden inflammation in your vocal cords which can resurface if measures are not followed adequately.  Treatment: 1. If you are having gastric issues, consider taking tablet Pantoprazole 40 mg once a day for 15 days. 2. Tablet Wysolone (Prednisolone) 20 mg once a day after breakfast for two days followed by 10 mg for two days and finally followed by 5 mg for the next two days. This is a steroid tablet and is effective in reducing inflammation in the vocal cords, but the above preventive measures should be taken if you want your voice back."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor,I am trying to conceive but my husband and I did cocaine a week ago.

And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

I have thoroughly gone through your case and can well understand your genuine health concerns. 1. No, there is not much problem right now as he vomited and also had a lot of water. It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases. Because, it is a volatile compound and causes vapors entering the lungs through the airways. 3. As it was only two drops, I do not think it may cause much trouble.

I used it for 30 days continuously, but no use. How many days should I take that powder and how to overcome this problem?","Doctor":"Hello. For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations. If the size and number of cysts are more, then I suggest consulting a gynecologist as you may require surgery. If the number and size of cysts are less, you may continue treatment along with syrup Evecare 10 ml BD and Kanchnar Guggulu two BD.

She had taken my blood sample and it was negative. But, still I have not gotten my periods and it has been a week ahead. What could be the reason for my late periods?","Doctor":"Hello. As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses.

What shall do to get it cured completely? My age is 42 and my weight is 82 kg. I am currently on Terbinafine 250 mg, Candiforce 100 mg and Clocip powder.","Doctor":"Hello. Ringworm infection in the groin is known as tinea cruris. It is a recurrent fungal infection. The treatment for tinea cruris includes topical application of ointment Miconazole sparingly to avoid maceration twice daily for minimum two weeks about 2 cm beyond the borders of the affected area. You may use Candiderm powder (combination of Beclomethasone dipropionate, Clotrimazole and Gentamicin sulfate) in the morning if application of ointment is inconvenient. Also, oral antifungal tablet Fluconazole (Diflucan) 150 mg once a week for four weeks should help you. For itching, I suggest tablet Levocetirizine twice daily. Consult your doctor, discuss with him or her and take the medicine with consent. For prevention, do not ever scratch the lesions as this may lead to superimposed secondary bacterial infection that further complicates the situation. Do not share your clothes. Wash your clothes and linen in hot water with antiseptic lotion or fungicidal soaps. Moist environment should be avoided that is refrain from wearing wet clothes, undergarments and socks. It will take minimum two weeks for the infection to regress. As already stated it is a recurrent infection and hence you need to strictly adhere to the advice elucidated above.

It appears you have a fissure and there is a damage to your tract due to hard stools. Your stool should be soft. For that, you should eat a high-fiber diet like fruits (apple, banana, oranges), green leafy vegetables (spinach), and raw cucumber.  Avoid smoking, refined food, fatty and oily food. You should have plenty of fluids and regular exercises.  Also, I suggest a syrup like Lactulose 15 to 30 ml at bedtime to maintain your stools soft. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines with their consent. Second, you can use 2 % Lidocaine gel before each stool so as to relieve the pain.

About 3 to 4 years ago, I was urinating every 5 to 10 minutes, so I used some medicines. It took about two months to get rid of this illness, but it did not heal completely. For the first two years, I was urinating in every 1 to 2 hours in winter and 2 to 3 hours in summer. I was and still am very weak during cold seasons. I even stopped taking soda drinks, as it made the frequency of urination more. During this two years, many doctors checked me, but they did not find any problem. I used many medicines, but I did not see any change. After these two years, I started masturbating three times a week, and I saw improvement in my condition. Now, I have to pee every 3 to 4 hours in winter and 5 to 7 hours in summer. But in the last 2 to 3 months, I stopped masturbating. And unfortunately, I started having bad times again. I have this problem, not the entire month, but it starts about 10 to 15 days a month. During nights, I do not have any problem. Is it possible that urination and masturbation are connected?

Is this some illness and what is the reason?","Doctor":"Hello. Since you have not mentioned in detail about the headache, it is difficult to diagnose with limited case history. However, I will try to discuss the various causes and the treatment. Temperomandibular joint disorder : Common symptoms include pain in face, jaw joint area, neck and shoulders, in or around the ear when you chew, speak or open your mouth wide. Clicking, popping or grating sounds in the jaw joint when you open or close your mouth or chew. This may or may not be painful. Tension headache: Tension headache occurs because of stress. The headache is usually present in the forehead and temples due to any stressful trigger that vary from person-to-person. Migraine: Migraine pain is moderate to severe, often described as pounding, throbbing pain. Migraine headaches can last from four hours to three days and usually occur one to four times per month. Migraines are associated with symptoms such as sensitivity to light, noise or odor, nausea or vomiting, loss of appetite and stomach upset or abdominal pain. I would advise you to try the treatment that I have mentioned. However, if the symptoms persist please consult a doctor nearby for further physical evaluation and treat accordingly.

How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

You have mentioned that your front teeth are protruded, large and that creates a space with the lower teeth. With these, I am pretty much sure that you might need braces (fixed orthodontic therapy). But a proper analysis of your teeth in position along with your skeletal outline are the factors which decide that you need braces. For beauty purpose, you can also discuss with your specialist about lingual braces or ceramic (tooth-colored) braces.

So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

I have thoroughly gone through your case and can well understand your genuine health concerns. 1. No, there is not much problem right now as he vomited and also had a lot of water. It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases.

For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations. If the size and number of cysts are more, then I suggest consulting a gynecologist as you may require surgery.

As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses.

His BP was high. He has diabetes. His CT Scan report says:- Impression: Multiple calcified foci as described above. Diffuse cerebral atrophy. Content: Two calcified foci without perilesional oedema are seen in bilateral occipital region. Prominence of cerebral cortical sulci are suggestive of diffuse cerebral atrophy. What dose this mean?","Doctor":"Hello, It seems from the history that your father is having sudden onset of double vision. He is a known diabetic and hypertensive. The CT scan report you have mentioned here like diffuse cerebral atrophy is not of much significant and they indicate age related changes. The CT scan findings are not significant as a cause for double vision. First the symptom needs to be evaluated to find out whether it is uniocular or binocular. Uniocular double vision means double vision with one eye open. Binocular double vision means double vision which disappears on closing on eye and present only with two eyes being kept open. The most commonest in this age group is binocular double vision. The most common cause in your father for double vision is nerve palsies which affect the extraocular muscles like 3rd, 4th, and 6th cranial nerves. The cause is because of diabetes and hypertension. Most of them recover by 3-6 months. The treatment by vitamin B12 supplements and other vitamin B complex will help to hasten the recovery. Along with this strict control of diabetes and hypertension is required. Do inform me regarding whether it is uniocular or binocular and status of diabetes and hypertension, so that I can guide you regarding further treatment. Hope the information is helpful to you.

See Kalarachi Kai choornam is helpful in amenorrhea. As far as small cysts are concerned they are unmatured eggs which failed to induce menstrual cycle previously, as a result, they got collected in the ovary and they will remain in the ovary. Now, you have got your periods you can start trying for conception. But I advise you to do it under the supervision of a nearby gynecologist because egg size is important while conception and that you can know by ovulation study.

I then lost weight and with time my enzymes got normalized. However, in last test, I have noticed a pattern where AST is greater than ALT, though they are in the normal range. AST is always greater than ALT a few points and in the last test, this increased more though the enzymes are normal. I have read the AST/ALT>1 is a sign of advanced liver disease or cirrhosis. Is this valid when the enzymes are in the normal range also? It is in the last three years that my platelet count changes in 128 to 180 range always.","Doctor":"Hi. No, the concept of AST: ALT is not valid when the enzymes are in normal range. However, low platelet count can be an early sign of liver cirrhosis.

How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected.

My basic complaint is recurrent UTI, poor urine flow and chronic testicular pain. I was down with kidney infection since past five months and had to be treated with Magnex Forte for five days. A CT scan showed mild perinephric stranding. I was put on low dose Niftran for three months. A follow-up CT scan with contrast revealed normal kidneys and function. Since my urine flow has always been poor, I did an ascending urethrogram a month back. The report indicated no obvious abnormality. There was bleeding and excruciating pain for two days post procedure. Four days later, I again developed severe UTI for which I had to take injections of Amikacin 750 mg for five days. I have once again been put on Niftran 100 mg twice daily. The urologist has suggested a bladder neck incision as he feels that my bladder neck is not opening fully and that there is a slight narrowing of the prostatic urethra. My prostate is slightly enlarged at 26 gm. The urologist is planning to widen neck and if required, scoop out prostate tissue that is blocking the passage. I have been on treatment for chronic testicular pain for last 8 to 9 years. I also have grade 2 varicocele, mild burning pain on tip of the penis. Earlier, I used to get burning pain in penis after ejaculation. One doctor suspects that I have chronic non-bacterial prostatitis. I am currently seeking advice that will help prevent upper UTI, increase urine flow and relax the bladder muscles. My average urine flow is only about 5 or 6 ml/sec. My medicines include Saw palmetto and Quercetin, Mildfil 5 mg, Silodosin 8 mg, Tapentadol 75 mg twice daily, Valium 5 mg and Duzela 20 mg. The last three are prescribed by a pain specialist. My urologist is planning to do a BNI including parts of the prostate (laser), varicocelectomy and a cystoscopy. There is a certain improvement in urine flow after I started taking Silodosin. It seems to be more effective than Tamsulosin and Alfuzosin (10 mg). The only drawback is complete retrograde ejaculation. Can I shift to Silodosin 4mg? Is it fine to do varicocelectomy and BNI at the same time? More importantly, will BNI offer excellent outcome as the X-ray does not indicate an obvious abnormality?","Doctor":"Hello. As per my understanding, you are suffering from two things. I want to see your urine flow report (printed graph). Do you have an ultrasound done? (I specifically want pre and post void urine residue if available). Now I think, regarding recurrent UTI, you may have two problems. Either problem in bladder itself or problem in bladder outflow (neck). These two can be differentiated by uroflowmetry and ultrasound. If required, a urodynamic test is the best. If the problem is bladder itself (weak bladder power), then you may improve with BNI (bladder neck incision) but not 100 percent. If the problem is not in the bladder, then you can go ahead with BNI and your UTI should improve. So, if you do not want urodynamic test then you can go ahead with BNI and in rare case, if you have bladder problem (weak bladder), then you may not improve as expected. Regarding varicocelectomy, both surgeries can be done together but again testicular pain has thousands of cause impossible to diagnose everything. If it is due to varicocele, then the pain will go. But, as per my experience, resolution of pain after varicocelectomy is only in 60 to 65 percent of patients. Retrograde ejaculation can occur with 4 mg also. So, you can try with 4 mg provided your urinary symptoms do not get worse.

Fatty liver may be due to alcohol intake or due to age related deranged lipids.  8. Early changes are observed in the cervical spine.  9. Age related osteoporosis of the bones is seen on chest x-ray and heart seems to be enlarged. 1.

Let me know if any assistance is required during the course of treatment. 1. Tablet Losartan is a good drug that you are taking. 2. It lowers blood pressure and decreases the risk of stroke in patients with high BP. 1. Avoid having heavy meals containing carbohydrates.  2. Fried fatty foods, junk foods and beverages should be avoided.  3. No added salts.  4. Take plenty of vegetables, salads, fruits and use Canola oil for cooking.  5.

I have no eyesight problems besides blepharitis and no unsteadiness or vomiting. I have done an MRI of head and neck six months back and it was clear, and I was diagnosed with fibromyalgia four months back.","Doctor":"Hello. Regarding your concern, I would explain that your symptoms are suggestive of tension type headache, which is a benign type of headache related to psychological stress. A wrong posture can also cause such type of headache. So, in my opinion, there is no reason to panic. I would just recommend taking painkillers (Acetaminophen or Ibuprofen) and try to relax. A warm bath can help too. If the headaches persist, I would recommend taking Duloxetine (considering also the diagnosis of fibromyalgia) or Amitriptyline. There is no need for brain MRI, as I am sure that it will result in normal. I hope this helps."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor,I am trying to conceive but my husband and I did cocaine a week ago. How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

After each masturbation my body suffers from huge energy loss and mild anxiety along with hyperexcitability for more than a week. Recently I have been having sex with my girlfriend for a couple of times where I do not feel that much tired.

What you call a deteriorating medical condition is not due to masturbation. Masturbation is absolutely normal for any human being and science has clearly demonstrated that it does not have any bad effects on the body. You can take it as a normal sexual activity where other partner is absent and you stimulate yourself to enjoy the good feeling associated with orgasm. In fact it is much safer than real sex as there is no risk of contacting Sexually Transmitted Diseases (STDs) with masturbation.What you are suffering is nothing other than the victim of all kind of non sense knowledge available in our society and over the internet.Having said this, what you are feeling is the normal reaction of body after any vigorous activity like exercise.

We cannot prevent it completely, but we can delay it for years. Our target is to delay the proliferative phase by controlling the blood sugar level. Regarding your medications, they are good but deficient as Lantus (insulin glargine injection) is not advisable to be given alone. Humalog 25 is required before main meals. Trajenta Duo (Linagliptin) 1000 can be replaced with Metformin 1000 once after lunch. The target HbA1c is below 7 in order to be strictly controlled. You are taking a low dose of insulin.

The way to detect if it is in the vitreous is to look sideways and if the floater follows the motion of the eye (slowly in the same direction) then it is in the vitreous and does not require quick intervention.

Over five months we are trying for baby and still no success. As some doctor suggested tablet Ovacare for my wife and Fertisure M for me, we are using these since last 5 months. The problem is that I cannot ejaculate when I am doing sex. Many times I failed to ejaculate into the vagina and my penis is no more harder after 3 to 5 minutes of sex. However I can ejaculate by masturbation.

The numbness from the anesthesia has subsided. But I have pain inside my tooth. I suspect that the pain in my tooth is due to the drilling done in my tooth. I have a strange pain shooting from my tooth up through the cheek into my temple and sinuses. My cheek is swollen, and the pain in my cheek is a headache type pain. Is this normal after a filling?","Doctor":"Hi. I can understand your concern. Yes, it is painful sometimes. But it is only related to the stimulus, that means the pain at the time of chewing or due to hot or cold fluids. If the pain is continuous and interferes with your sleep cycle, you may need to revisit the dentist and get the filling removed. Sometimes the long buccal anesthesia wound gets infected and can cause pain. But in your case, the pain looks like pulpitis, and it is not usual if it continues for more than three days."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I have been diagnosed with PCOD for many years and now planning for conception. We have been trying various medicines and methods for two years. After all these failures, my doctor suggested for IVF. Simultaneously, I came across bonduc nut. I consumed it for close to 80 days and got my regular period, however no pregnancy. Now since I have stopped consuming this nut, my period has also stopped. I have again started consuming this nut. Can you please suggest medication which can help me conceive within three months or so naturally? During allopathy medications, I used to ovulate, and my follicle size was also good enough, but they used to give the injection to rupture. There are no blocks in the fallopian tube. My husband has no issues with the sperm count. Please help.","Doctor":"Hello. I just read your query. See ideally this medicine should be consumed for three months regularly, and then you can stop it. If you are taking it without consulting physician, then I advise you to stop taking it. For PCOD, you can take Tablet Kanchnar Guggul two tablets two times a day with water after food for one month. Take Shatavari capsules two capsules two times a day with water after food for one to two months. After conception stop taking these. For conception, if you are getting the periods then, first of all, try between 11 to 15 days of your cycle. You can also visit for ovulation study so that you can know about the size of the egg. But as conception is a crucial thing I advise you to visit your gynecologist regularly. I hope you understand my point.

It is usual to have some degree of urgency in BPH (benign prostatic hyperplasia), but if it continues to persist even after your urinary stream improves, then one should make sure that there is no UTI or chronic prostate infection causing the symptoms.

How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

This can lead to a sensitivity in that tooth for a few days. You also need to check if there is any tingling sensation or not.

He is 58 years old and is diabetic and currently under medication for BP also. He has a history of two major heart attacks. In the last five years, he did not have any major heart issues. Recently due to extensive amount of medications taken for a long time, he started showing signs of high amount of creatinine (currently 6.9). We did a few dialyses. Now doctors have advised doing an AV fistula on his left hand. His left hand is partially amputated from a previous septic shock treatment about four years back. His right hand is fine but an AV fistula there might terribly limit his movements and self-care. We wanted a medical opinion about where the fistula can be placed or can it be near to chest area as an alternate option?","Doctor":"Hi. There are three main types of AVF (arteriovenous fistula). The radiocephalic fistula is a forearm fistula created by anastomosing the side of a radial artery to the end of a cephalic vein. It is also referred to as the Brescia-Cimino fistula. The brachiocephalic fistula is an upper arm fistula created by connecting the side of a brachial artery to the end of a cephalic vein or slightly central to the level of the elbow. Finally, the brachial artery–to–transposed basilic vein (BTB) fistula is another upper arm fistula. This fistula is created by anastomosing the side of a brachial artery to the end of a basilic vein that has been transposed laterally and elevated superficially to make it amenable to dialysis cannulation. Other sites could be leg also. I advise you to discuss it with your doctor. The patient requires dialysis for sure or you can put a central line and replace it every 15 to 20 days. But AV fistula is the best option."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, My boyfriend works in navy. We just started dating and have mostly had long distance relationship because of our situation. I have never taken birth control and or ECP. I have always had an average 28-day cycle. However, between last two to three months, I took five emergency contraceptive pills. I know it is too much, and it is wrong to take that many, but due to our uncertain living situation, I had to do so. My cycle reached up to 37 days, and I visited a gynaecologist. She did a pregnancy test which came negative. She also checked to make sure I had no infection. I did have a uterus swelling. She advised me to wait and allow my body to bounce back to its normal cycle naturally. She said it would take anywhere between few days to three months for my periods to get back to normal. She also prescribed daily contraceptive pills. Anyways, I got my period within six days. Last month as we both had to leave, I did not start the daily contraceptive pill. I took another one ECP and got my periods as normal. As my periods were ending, we had sex, and I took another ECP. My next period was due at the end of the month. However, he made an impromptu flight to see me and happened to come on the day that I was expecting my periods. We had sex on that day. But he did not climax. And since I was due for my periods, I thought I should not take an ECP again because I did not want to mess up my already messed up hormones. However, I did not get my periods. It is 11 days, and I took two pregnancy tests and both tests came negative. Please advise.","Doctor":"Hi. You already messed up your cycle, and you do not have any choice left now. You have to wait for your period. You will also have to do a repeat urine pregnancy test after every four to five days till you get your periods. The other option that you have is to take some birth control pills or progesterone tablets for few days and wait for the period after that. And do urine pregnancy test every four to five days till you get your periods. As you already messed up your cycle. It is tough to predict your ovulation time. If you do not get your period now, it may be that you are pregnant also. It is just early non-detectable level of hormones in urine. This is one possibility. The other is you just did not ovulate this time and because of that, your periods may get delayed this time. In that case, there will be no pregnancy. So I am asking for repeat test every four to five days. Sometimes irregular cycle will not become regular and ultimately with irregular cycle and irregular ovulation you will end up in infertility and may require treatment for pregnancy. So be serious about it, and it is not very hard also. Do consult a nearby specialist doctor, talk about available options, understand the merits and demerits of every method and do choose best according to your lifestyle and convenience.

I have gone through your details. Many times some people do experience some kind of disturbance in menstrual patterns after taking an i-pill. As you got your periods on 27th March which was a withdrawal bleed, ideally speaking you should have been getting it around 24-28th April as per your routine cycle length. And this also not your fertile period as your cycles were always regular. But I would still advise you to take an emergency contraceptive pill because the previous cycle was disrupted with high dose hormones contained in i-pill. And the present cycle we do not know when exactly you ovulated. So it is better to take a preventive method as precautions (although repeated emergency contraceptive pills are not advised). Please use a more consistent method of birth control in the future like condoms and oral contraceptive pills which give a wider window of safe period and also would not disturb the menstrual cycles like emergency contraceptive pills. I hope this helps."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, If I buy used lip gloss with an applicator that dips into the bottle, could there be any worrisome that bacteria or virus from the previous user's lips withstand the cosmetic preservatives?

He is a bodybuilder and currently not able to do workouts since he has pain and numbness in both upper and lower sides of the body in the right region. He also has muscle imbalance because of that. We have consulted several doctors but we are not able to get a proper solution for the same. He recently had SI joint injection but the pain has not reduced yet. What can we do to cure the anterior pelvic tilt?","Doctor":"Hello. It is common for this anterior pelvic tilt position to drastically affect your posture even up into the upper back and neck. The tight muscles are hip flexors, tensor fascia lata, and quadriceps and weak muscles are the gluteal groups and hamstring, abdominals. Stretch psoas & hip flexor and stretch exercise that relieves the overactive muscles. Pain is probably due to the compression of nerves that causes severe numbness and sometimes tingling sensation. Pain management procedures include exercise, physical therapy, occupational therapy, and pain management medications. Medicines range from simple anti-inflammatory medications to opioids based on the pain scale and treatment. It is better to have an appointment at pain clinics, especially for pain management.

The diagnosis was made three years ago. Metastasis found this year through FDG PET CT scan. The primary treatment was for breast lumpectomy, followed by chemotherapy (3 FEC+3 Docetaxel), and radiation therapy. For MBC at liver took Trastuzumab plus Leuprolide 3.75 ( eight cycles) and Letrozole 2.5mg. There was a progression to bilateral oophorectomy plus DJ stenting at the urethra. Also, Trastuzumab plus Letrozole. After progression on Trastuzumab and Fulvestrant. Is the present treatment plan as per guidelines as per ESMO or ASCO? If not, then what does the guideline say? The patient feels pain in the abdomen region which worsens at night. As per the urologist, there is no gynecological or urological problem as very recently the DJ stent was replaced with new one. What is the solution?","Doctor":"Hello. It looks like she is having progressive metastatic breast cancer triple positive (ER +, Her 2 +ve). She received chemotherapy, hormonal, and target therapy (Trastuzumab). She also underwent BCS, oophorectomy, plus radiotherapy. Despite all this treatment. she progressed twice. Before I give some suggestions I need to know about her general condition (walking, eating well, recent weight loss, pain control, any chronic illness)? Any family history of breast cancer? If her performance status is good and she is tolerating all the medicines well, she must take more treatment. There are now few options left. That is to add Pertuzumab, Lapatinib or TDM-1. But all of these medicines are very expensive and now at this stage, if there is diffuse metastasis these medicines will not have a curative role but only a palliative role and may add some benefit only. Another option is to start Eribulin injection (chemotherapy) which can be given after progression from Taxane and Anthracycline chemotherapy or to start some other drugs as palliative chemotherapy. The abdomen pain she is experienced may be related to liver metastasis. She has received treatment as per guidelines till now except (Pertuzumab/TDM 1) which are very expensive and few people afford it. Unfortunately, as per the reports (attachment removed to protect patient identity), it is an advanced malignancy. Now the goal of the treatment is just palliation. Her performance status looks 2 (ECOG). The goal of the treatment should be to control her pain, to maintain intake (nutrition) and output (bowel bladder habits). Provide her psychological support and family support. She should also visit her oncologist for follow up if she is not willing for chemotherapy. At least hormonal treatment and Bisphosphonates are recommended and will be well tolerated (after consultation with a primary oncologist). Lapatinib at this stage may even cause more toxicity than benefit (diarrhea, vomiting, hand-foot syndrome, cardiac toxicity).

She develops a very bad cough and then along with fever in a day or two. She had a wheezing problem previously so the doctor had prescribed to give Budecort and Levolin puffs or nebulization. So every time when she develops this kind of a dry cough, I am not able to differentiate whether it is just a dry cough or wheezing related. Her cough kind of gets worse in two days and also while sleeping, she coughs continuously. My doctor has suggested giving Ascoril LS and if a cough does not subside then try giving Levolin. What medication should be followed? Also, Metal-P has to be given if the fever crosses 101 but my concern is which thermometer has to be followed. The touch thermometer or the digital one as both show different readings. She gets a fever every six months and we end up admitting her for high-grade fever. What should I do to improve her immunity? She has also started complaining of leg pain once in 2 or 3 months and I was told it is growth pain. Is it of any concern and is there anything that I can follow to prevent it?","Doctor":"Hello. If you say it is a dry cough, Levolin (Levosalbutamol sulfate) nebulization is not required. This could be allergic also. Also, children have a fever off and on. It could be viral till 5 years of age. After that, their immunity becomes well. Use glass thermometer and follow that only. Do not confuse. Also, if her activity and diet are well, no need to worry.

I did not get motion for the last three days and have lower back pain and gas problem. Please suggest what to do.","Doctor":"Hi. During pregnancy, progesterone hormone increases. The progesterone hormone has effects on the bowel. The movement of bowel decreases, the secretions from the lining of bowel increases and sphincter becomes tight. So, the net response is that you will have constipation, gastritis, vomiting tendency, heartburn and bloated feeling in the abdomen. If the problem of bowel movement is not resolved, then I suggest syrup Duphalac (Lactulose) or Cremaffin plus (Liquid Paraffin) two tablespoon at night once a week. Consult your treating doctor, discuss with him or her and take treatment with consent.

Is it common at this age? What is the risk?","Doctor":"Hi. It would be better if you send me your detailed history regarding previous menstrual, obstetrics, gynecology, medical and drug history. Your age is less risky to have genital anomalies as you are too young. Trisomies are more likely to occur in advanced maternal age. Family history is also a factor if you have a family history of congenital anomaly. You have more chances if your immediate blood relatives have it. Nuchal translucency also matters. It is best measured around 13 weeks. It should be less than 3 mm actually. Biochemical profile showing 1 in 111 women of the same hormonal level have expected chances of trisomy. So combined risk is not high. Be positive and follow your treating doctor if you have any abnormal symptoms.

Every time, I shampoo my hair, I would lose 50 to 100 strands of hair. I have an oily, itchy scalp and to some point, my scalp is visible (not completely bald) and my hair density has also reduced. I wash my hair with warm to hot water. I have researched a lot about this on the internet and found that stress and poor diet can cause hair loss. I consulted a doctor and she prescribed Anaphase shampoo and some vitamin pills and Minoxidil which I did not use after studying about it. My hair fall has reduced to some point after those medications, but my question is can I regrow my hair back and if so, how much time it will take if I follow a healthy diet.","Doctor":"Hello. You should take Minoxidil at least for six months. If there is dandruff, it should be treated with antifungal shampoo. The normal shedding per day is 35 to 45 hairs. Of course, hair can grow again but healthy diet alone will not be enough. Send me a photo or visit a dermatologist in order to classify the stage and followup as well as to determine the appropriate therapy.

I had normal flow for the next four days. But on the fifth day, it got reddish brown again. Today I noticed little light pink blood when I wiped. Is this normal? How do I chart my period? Should I start charting the day I see spotting and end it on the day there is no more blood on the tissue? I am nervous about ovarian, uterine or cervical cancer.","Doctor":"Hi. Let me start by assuring you that these are normal features. You are normal from the history you have mentioned. For a young lady, cancer is not possible, unless you have a strong family history of cancer. During periods, the follicles keep on growing slowly, along with them, the endometrium or inner lining of the uterus also thickens. Then around 12th to 16th day of periods, ovulation occurs and the egg is pushed into the tube. The remains of the follicle, which is called corpus luteum, it is the source of progesterone hormone, which further keeps the endometrium thick and spongy for a possible pregnancy. If no pregnancy, this comes out in the form of blood, bright or slightly dark red blood, for around seven days.Then it stops as the next cycle's follicles get ready. Now in your condition, all these are due to some hormone imbalance. It can be caused by your weight. The second possibility is a vaginal infection. Vaginal infection is transmitted during sex, so you and your partner have to be treated at a time, or else you will get infected again. You may have white or yellow or grayish discharge with or without itching, foul smell, pain at the beginning and late towards the end of sex. Pain will be radiating to the back, thighs. The infection will cause congestion of the glands, and they keep oozing discharge even after periods are over, which comes as pinkish discharge. You will need evaluation by a gynecologist.

I have ulcers, sore throat, occasional oral thrush, difficulty swallowing, lump on the throat (larynx), night sweats, fever, loose teeth, and abnormal discoloration in mouth. I am currently on birth control patch, Dextro-amphetamine and Cymbalta. I have been struggling for months now with quite a few mouth and throat issues. I have constant mouth ulcers that are taking weeks to heal, I get the sensation that I have not swallowed something completely down and that it stuck so I will keep swallowing and swallowing it drives me mad. It is not easy for me to keep doing this because swallowing feels harder than it should be almost like my throat is too swollen. I have a sore throat 80% of the time. I have odd waves of oral thrush and my mouth also has pale and red areas on my soft palate, my hard palate is just very pale. I have a couple of loose teeth but otherwise in very good shape. Frequent random nose bleeds that are usually heavy but can be light at times. Night sweats every night and feeling easily overheated during the days. I have also now become more concerned since my throat developed a hard lump on the top of my larynx. It feels very swollen where it is almost like it is ready to explode. It does not move and it stays firm putting a lot of pressure on my throat. I am assuming this is why it feels hard to swallow. It does not hurt but if I push on it to feel the firmness it causes discomfort to the surroundings mostly underneath the lump.","Doctor":"Hi. First and foremost, I would advise you not to panic or get disheartened. According to me, there is no major issue out there and we usually encounter such issues very often in our outpatient department. Now looking at your case, oral ulcers can be due to various causes right from nutritional and vitamin deficiencies to infections or repeated trauma. Getting each and every parameter tested often becomes extremely expensive and might frustrate you even more. Coming to your second major concern, difficulty in swallowing with no major pain as such can be due to some ulcers down in your throat, or infection in your pharynx (throat), or constant gastric irritation. Advice: 1. Consider taking a good multivitamin for two to three months. 2. Follow a healthy, hygienic lifestyle. 3. Avoid smoking, alcohol, etc. 4. Avoid having spicy, oily, and junk food items. 5. Salt water gargles at least 8 to 10 times a day. You should keep your oral cavity free from contaminating organisms and hence the throat infection. 6. Keep sipping on boiled warm water. 7. Consider antireflux therapy if you have the slightest of reflux issues. 8. Get your viral markers for HIV, HbsAg and blood sugars done too. 9. Do not Google too much of your symptoms out. 10. Do not correlate too many unnecessary things and do not take stress at any cost, sometimes stress can be responsible for non-healing ulcers."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor,I am trying to conceive but my husband and I did cocaine a week ago. How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases.

For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations. If the size and number of cysts are more, then I suggest consulting a gynecologist as you may require surgery.

As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses.

The fact that you have missed your menses by 7 days and the urine pregnancy test is negative, indicates that you are not pregnant. But considering the fact that this is the first time, the doctor must have ordered blood-based serum beta hCG test which is again a more specific test for detecting pregnancy. If the hcg levels are less than 1 ng/dl then it ensures that you are not pregnant at all. The delay or absence of period at your age group can be due to stress-induced hormonal imbalances most likely, but nevertheless, a hormonal profile should be done to look for any hypothyroidism or hyperprolactinemia.

There are many causes of pain in the lower back region. It can be due to faulty posture, related to weak muscles, issues with intervertebral disc, narrowing of spinal canal, or any bony instability besides many others. So accurate diagnosis is the key to proper management of the condition. You will have to elaborate your problem as to a detailed discussion of your back pain which means the duration of pain and mode of onset. I would also like to ask you if it is associated with any leg pain or any other neurological symptoms like numbness, paraesthesias (electrical shock like abnormal sensations), or any weakness in limbs? Any associated symptoms like fever, weight loss, etc? What medications are you generally taking until now for your existing problem? If you have localized back pain with no other symptoms like radiating leg pain, neurological symptoms like numbness, weakness, paresthesia, etc, then you can start with the following recommendations for an initial period of two to three weeks. 1. Maintain proper posture of your back while working and sleeping. 2. If pain is more then you can take a short course of anti-inflammatory medication like Etoricoxib or Paracetamol or one which suits you. 3. Physical therapy initially under the supervision of a trained physiotherapist and then to continue at home. 4. Adequate calcium and Vitamin D intake, if levels are low in the body. 5. Ice packs can be applied if your pain is acute, then hot fomentation can be done at home. 6. Analgesic spray for local application can be used and is easily available. 7. Avoid lifting heavyweight, acute forward bending in the mornings, etc. We will observe you for the next two to three weeks how you respond to this conservative management protocol. If you are not feeling better, then we will have to get some investigations like, dynamic x-rays of lower back and few blood tests for evaluation."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I had sexual intercourse with my fiance on the fifth day of my periods, and we used a condom, but the condom tore.

I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases.

For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations. If the size and number of cysts are more, then I suggest consulting a gynecologist as you may require surgery.

As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses.

So, I consulted a gynecologist and she gave me some Multivitamins and they became normal. When I stopped taking them, they again became irregular. At the age of 18, I consulted another gynecologist and he said I have a cyst in one of my ovaries, so, he gave me a medicine to dissolve the cyst. My stomach was very painful at that time. Then, after that again the periods became normal and again after some time, they became irregular. So, when I consulted another gynecologist, she gave contraception pills. They were normal until I was taking them. Now, I have stopped taking any medication from past two years and suddenly from past six months, my weight has gradually increased.

When i cough and taking deep breath its very painfull... I started taking antibiotics yesterday. It will just go away? For how long the pain will ease?","Doctor":"Hi, I hope you are doing well. I have gone through your symptoms. You are having Pneumonia on the rt side. Pneumonia is inflammation of lung parenchyma. It can result in fever cough with expectoration and breathlessness. Sometimes it can result in pleural effusion (fluid accumulation in between the lung covering) and pleurisy (inflammation of lung covering ). when there is inflammation of lung covering it can cause sharp pain when you take deep breath and cough. It is possible that you are having pleurisy. It is part of early infection to your left side of the lung. This infection could be due to bacteria or viruses. I suggest you continue to take a proper antibiotic in proper doses and proper duration. You should watch red flag signs such as persistent fever, breathing difficulty, increased breathing rate and heart rate. If this happens you should report to your physician. For pain, you should take PARACETAMOL 650 mg twice or thrice in a day as required. You should take this after food. You can also youse Ibuprofen if you are not allergic to it.

How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

The CECT scan report says that G.B. is slightly distended. Gross asymmetrical wall thickening is seen mainly in the fundus of the gallbladder extending up to the neck forming a soft tissue mass. This mass shows poor heterogeneous enhancement and appears to invade the adjacent liver parenchyma. Radioopaque calculus is seen in the GB lumen. This ill-defined mass is seen extending from the neck of gallbladder along the cystic duct into the CBD. Hereby, compressing the CBD, the mass has extended beyond the porta hepatitis to encircle the main portal vein and the common hepatic artery and it is possibly invading adjacent head of the pancreas. The proximal CBD is dilated and mid-CBD is constricted due to the extension of the GB mass. The main portal vein and the common hepatic artery is encircled by the gallbladder mass. The liver is mildly enlarged. Ill-defined poorly enhancing hypodense lesions are seen in the liver adjacent to the GB fossa.

As the disease has spread to the liver and it is encasing, portal vein surgery is not an option. Further plan will depend on how good is his general condition. As the disease is also blocking cystic duct, his bilirubin is increasing and chemotherapy is not possible with rising bilirubin.

I would prefer ERCP with stenting if possible as it is better tolerated by the patient. After that an FNAC (fine needle aspiration cytology) from gall bladder mass to confirm cancer is advisable. Then he can be started on chemotherapy to keep the disease under check. Meanwhile, he should continue with pain medication and supportive care.

How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

I have thoroughly gone through your case and can well understand your genuine health concerns. 1. No, there is not much problem right now as he vomited and also had a lot of water. It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases. Because, it is a volatile compound and causes vapors entering the lungs through the airways. 3. As it was only two drops, I do not think it may cause much trouble.

For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations. If the size and number of cysts are more, then I suggest consulting a gynecologist as you may require surgery.

As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses.

What to do? I am taking tablet Thyronorm 150 mg.","Doctor":"Hi. I have gone through the attachment (attachment removed to protect patient identity). The cyst in the right ovary is found with thick walls and shows internal echoes, with size more than 4 mm. Ideally, the differentiation is needed to be done to know whether it is endometrioma, hemorrhagic cyst, and ovarian tumor, which presents with internal echoes and often with internal septations.  So it is better to get tumor markers done to rule out any possibility of ovarian cancer, hence get CA 125 (cancer antigen 125), CEA (carcinoembryonic antigen), AFP (alpha-fetoprotein), beta hCG done. If it is negative then, one can be assured, and you can go for medical or surgical intervention.  Considering the size, which is more than 4 mm, it is advisable to get it laparoscopically removed as it may not regress with medical management of hormonal pills or oral contraceptive pills for hemorrhagic cyst or endometrioma.  You may discuss the options with your Gynecologist in detail and try to have an informed decision.

I can understand your concern. Your symptoms are consistent with anal fissure. Yes, fissure will heal on its own, provided it will get a proper environment. An anal fissure can be prevented by avoiding constipation. Because constipation will produce more pressure on the inner wall of the anal canal, which worsens the fissure. I suggest you try taking medication for pain, apply local anesthetic ointment for quick pain relief, anti-inflammatory medication, and sitz bath to reduce the swelling.

At the beginning of this year, I started having chest pain located near or right over my right side. Mostly they are a short quick burst of pain at random intervals but sometimes they stick around. A couple of weeks after the pain started, I had my first ever panic attack. Though I was having a heart attack, in the ER I had an ECG, chest X-ray and blood work. The tests showed nothing. The chest pain went away for a couple months. They then came back with worse during last month and I am still dealing with them. Since then I have met with a cardiologist. They performed a treadmill stress test (results normal) and I am currently wearing an event monitor for a month. I am having trouble accepting this might be anxiety causing the pains. I am worried it might be angina. The pain did not hurt earlier while working out but now it hurts. I do not know if that is because I am focusing on them and worrying about them.

Historically, and also on investigations like TMT (treadmill test), it does not appear to be a cardiac pain (attachment removed to protect patient identity). I guess you do not smoke or drink. The usual cause for this is musculoskeletal pain arising from muscles and bones which may increase during exercise due to rapid and heavy breathing.

After the surgery, I was unable to walk as my right leg became very weak. Now my age is 20 years. I can walk and play now. But, I walk with some difficulty, and after surgery, I had bulgy scoliosis. But from year to year scoliosis got 70 % alright. I have started playing badminton for a month. Yesterday, during playing, I had some pin pain in the area of my scoliosis. The scoliosis area on my right spine is paining inside. When I touch the place, it looks loose with nerves moving here and there.","Doctor":"Hi. The present pain in the scoliotic region might be due to a muscular strain in the paraspinal muscles, which is quite common while playing sports like badminton. Another possibility is an early neuro radiculopathy, occurring due to a pinched nerve in one of the intervertebral discs in the affected region. I would suggest you take antispasmodic muscle relaxants like Chlorzoxazone or Thiocolchicoside along with analgesics or anti-inflammatory tablets. Methylcobalamin, Folic acid tablets will alleviate neuropathic pain. Local analgesic sprays or gels followed by hot fomentation will be helpful. Avoid bending forward or lifting heavy weight at least for a week. It is better to avoid playing badminton until you become perfectly alright. If you are not getting cured, get an MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) of the affected spine done and consult an orthopedic neurosurgeon.

Two days before I had pain in my one molar tooth in the right jaw. Kindly give me advice and suggest me medicine for getting rid of pain and bleeding gums.","Doctor":"Hi. I have gone through your query. You have mentioned two situations and let me cover one by one. Firstly, bleeding gums. This is due to inflamed (simply, swollen) gums. The most probable cause is calculus (hard deposits) and plaque (soft deposits) irritating your gums. The treatment for this is to get a professional cleaning (scaling) done by a dentist. You can do lukewarm salt water gargling to give some relief to the gums. Mouthwash (preferably, Chlorhexidine) can be used but use it after diluting it with water and once or twice daily till the gum condition is very severe. After that, you can continue just lukewarm salt water gargling, as Chlorhexidine can cause teeth discoloration. Next, pain in the molar. This can be due to deep caries (cavity) or an impacted tooth, or simply because of the inflammation of the gums covering the partially erupted tooth (pericoronitis), or some other cause. This can be confirmed only after examination. Kindly send a picture of the affected tooth to guide you with a provisional diagnosis. X-ray (IOPA or OPG) and clinical examination will be required for final diagnosis. The treatment will depend upon the condition or diagnosis. It can either go for root canal treatment or filling or removal or just scaling might be enough. Do you have any difficulty in mouth opening, pain during sleep, any swelling, fever, pus discharge, lymphadenopathy (swollen lymph node below the angle of jaw), sinusitis, or any other symptoms or problems?  Do you smoke or consume tobacco? If yes, try to avoid it slowly and get rid of it as these can also cause gum inflammation, destruction of tooth-supporting structures and bone loss, in turn leading to tooth mobility and tooth loss, and cavities too, and other mouth problems. Take care. For more information consult a dentist online -->"},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I am not sexually active, but I am getting brown discharge over a month from my last periods.

I feel sleepy during office timing, even though I have 8 hours sleep during night. Please advice.","Doctor":"Hello. Feeling sleepy during office timing is most commonly caused by absence of a sound sleep at night. Sleeping for 8 hours during night not always means that you are having a healthy sleep. A healthy sleep is determined by the following factors: As you told that you are sleeping for about 8 hours at night and your age is 24 years, this is an adequate sleep at this age (6-8 hours). However if you still feel sleepy during your office hours, this can be due to inadequate sleep in terms of quality of sleep. Besides this, few other things also hamper sleep quality such as: I would recommend you a few changes that you can make at your work place such as make your work area more stimulating, work in chunks, take breaks in between your work, do not work for long hours at a stretch, drink water in between, avoid too much tea/coffee in order to work continuously, get involved in conversations in between for a while to refresh yourself. Also try and maintain sleep hygiene at bed time. Besides this if you continue to have this problem, seek an opinion from a sleep medicine physician online, get yourself evaluated for any of the above causes for sleep disturbances -->"},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, My blood report came today surprise me that my creatinine is 3.05 mg/dL.

I am taking Verapamil ER 180 mg and Atorvastatin 20 mg for high blood pressure for last 15 years.","Doctor":"Hi. As I understand, you are having hypertension for past 15 years, apparently under control at present. Many a time, hypertension can remain undetected, without symptoms for long. So we may not know the exact duration of the disease in many patients. You have hypertension for a minimum of 15 years. It is not mentioned about the status of control in initial years. I hope that it was controlled. Looking at your results, this is most likely to be hypertensive kidney disease. However, we have to rule out precipitating or complicating factors like recent intake of painkillers, obstruction of urinary tract like prostate enlargement (normal PSA- prostate-specific antigen need not rule it out), recent infection, etc., many of these factors, if treated, may to some extent reverse kidney failure which you have. I suggest you have an ultrasound abdomen and urine routine.

How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases.

For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations. If the size and number of cysts are more, then I suggest consulting a gynecologist as you may require surgery.

As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves.

In the recent years, breast areola becomes dry. Biopsies revealed no cancer. She was followed closely by an oncologist and a dermatologist with number of tests. Recently, a mole appeared in the areola region. The dermatologist decided to take a biopsy after three months and the result is inconclusive. Her doctor said that it could be nothing or it could be some cancer named squamous skin cancer. She is afraid of melanoma, but the doctor said melanoma is extremely unlikely. She is very nervous and scared. I could not send pictures because my friend does not want to. What do you think? Please advice.","Doctor":"Hi. Post radiation therapy, the skin does suffer a burnt both immediate as well as on a long term. Dryness, itching leading to oozing and crusting are very common complaints after radiotherapy and can start as late as 15 to 20 years too after the treatment. Radiation therapy does not increase the risk of melanoma. There are chances for basal cell carcinoma, which is much easier to treat and not life threatening. Squamous cell cancer also can occur, however, simple eczema needs to be ruled out even before thinking of the same. A negative biopsy is quite sensitive if chosen from the appropriate site. I would advise not to panic for the fear of a melanoma and instead keep up with close follow up to note the course of the problem. 1. Nipple eczema, post radiation. 2.

Multiple small clustered lesions are benign (non-cancerous) cystic lesions.

In case you have any first-degree relative diagnosed with breast or ovarian cancer or any other cancer, then it is better to go for a genetic counseling also.

The histochemical examination showed synaptophysin positive, P63 and CK5/6 negative, KI67 80% positive and histopathologic observation confirmed the basaloid tumor.

She had a history of hyper/hypothyroidism about 10 years ago, but the last two years her thyroid has been managed and she stopped taking T4. Her cardiologist told her about 10 years ago to start taking Inderal (Propranolol 20 mg per day divided in a two time dose) because she had palpitations and some arrhythmias. She had an echo/ecg about a year ago and her heart was fine and her cardiologist suggested stopping Inderal. But being a very anxious person and having frequently anxiety tachycardias she did not stop it. Which brings me to the present, having been diagnosed the past six months by her pulmonologist with allergic rhinitis/asthma and having frequent wheezing episodes, even though she takes antihistamines when the episodes occur. Shouldn't she change her beta-blocker to a cardio-selective one? She finds herself not being able to breathe while on Inderal, but the symptoms reappear when she takes it. What would you recommend as a cardioselective beta-blocker? Would it be safe to change from Inderal, to let us say Atenolol? If yes, how would she do it?","Doctor":"Hello. I have gone through the history you have described for your mother. I really appreciate the way you have presented it with all details. It is very important to know the reason to start tablet Inderal at first point. What kind of arrhythmia it was and all in order to evaluate does she really need to continue any beta blocker. As your Cardiologist year ago after cardiac evaluation did not find any reason to continue the medication as per your history. As we see in a day to day practice patients with palpitations just due to anxiety or stress and without any cardiac issue, non-selective beta blockers would definitely aggravate her symptoms. BP you have mentioned in your description is wrong I guess. As it appears to be 12/20 something, might be a type error but looks normal to me. For time being you can change the beta blocker to a selective beta blocker like Metaprolol (12.5 mg) or Nebivolol (2.5 mg) or Atenelol (25 mg)on a very low dose. Get her evaluated again with her cardiac reports whenever possible and if not required better to slowly taper her beta blocker medication and stop as well. Because though cardioselective beta blockers has some or minimal effect on beta 2 receptors as well. Even I would advise to start meditation and yoga to overcome her anxiety issue, that will help her in controlling palpitations if they are related. Would like to review her all previous and recent cardiac records to further discuss and clarify management strategy."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I have developed some sort of a rash near the bikini line (on the inner left side of the thigh). It is extremely itchy and uncomfortable. Could you please tell me what it is. The image is attached.","Doctor":"Hi. I have gone through your complaints and reviewed the attached photograph (attachment removed to protect patient identity). It is tinea which is a superficial fungal infection of the skin. You need to take oral and topical antifungals. If I was your treating doctor I would recommend you to take tablet Terbinafine (tablet Sebifin) 250 mg twice daily and apply Luliconazole cream (Lulifin cream) on the affected area once daily. For itching, take tablet Levocetirizine 5 mg twice daily. These need to be continued for four weeks. These are prescription drugs and should be taken under the supervision of the doctor. Also, keep the area dry and clean, avoid sharing of soaps and towel, stay in a cool airy environment and wear loose-fitting cotton clothes."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I had sex with my fiancee using a condom but it was doubtful if the condom was broken but I could not confirm. Because one moment, while we were having sex, I felt myself without the condom but when I pulled out the condom, no drop was fallen. Because of this, I had given her I-pill and she had taken it around 48 hours after the sex. But it was on the second day from her date of the period. So, she is getting scared if any chance of pregnancy is there or not. What is the reason for the delaying period?","Doctor":"Hi. Since you have taken an emergency pill within 72 hours of intercourse, there is no chance of pregnancy. The delay could be because of the hormonal changes due to the pill she had taken. So relax and do not worry. However, if you have a doubt, then get a urine pregnancy test done with early morning urine sample to ensure that she is not pregnant. Do get back to me with reports so that I can guide you further on. Take care."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am 19 years old, seemingly healthy with a history of anxiety. I recently had CBC, thyroid, kidney, cholesterol, and glucose test and all came back normal so I am not anemic or hyperthyroid. For several years, when I go from sitting to standing my heart rate increases to about 110 and I get dizzy initially but I feel back to normal after about 30 seconds. My other symptom is when exercising my heart rate increases very fast very quickly. It often gets to 170. I feel fine when it does, and it comes down when I rest, but why does it get so high during exercise? If I had SVT or AFIB, would the heart rate not stay above 100 even when I quit exercising? What does it sound like I have? Does this sound SVT or POTS? Currently, I am taking Luvox 200 mg.","Doctor":"Hi. As you are concerned about this HR (heart rate) being atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter or SVT (supraventricular tachycardia), first, HR is usually more than 130 to 140 in these conditions, especially in SVT. Secondly, these disorders do not have any specific relationship with exercise or rest, meaning this does not start with exercising. It can kick in while resting all off sudden and can convert back any time. Your pattern is more consistent with sinus tachycardia. You may need a tilt test for diagnosis. Talk to your doctor. In addition, I would recommend you remain well hydrated and use thigh-high TED hose. This will help you with symptoms.

How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases.

Our family friend suggested me to consume Kalarchikai medicine, powdered mixed with pepper and honey to have it for one mandalam (48 days). I have completed nearly 44 days by consuming one small ball of the mixture every morning and before two weeks I got my periods. Then I had checked whether the cysts were dissolved by having an abdomen scan. But still, small multiple follicules have been seen in it with both ovaries enlarged. Kindly suggest me what I can do further. I got married before one and a half years and I am much worried about my pregnancy. I have gallstones as well.","Doctor":"Hello. I just read your query. See Kalarachi Kai choornam is helpful in amenorrhea. As far as small cysts are concerned they are unmatured eggs which failed to induce menstrual cycle previously, as a result, they got collected in the ovary and they will remain in the ovary. Now, you have got your periods you can start trying for conception. But I advise you to do it under the supervision of a nearby gynecologist because egg size is important while conception and that you can know by ovulation study. Ovulation study is performed under the supervision of a gynecologist. For gall stones, surgical intervention is required generally. Medicine is not of much help."},{"Patient":"Hello,This is not an average question but I hope someone may help me. A few months ago I have been diagnosed with atypical dermatitis. My simptoms were red spots regularly appearing and disappearing. They were not itchy except (slightly) on the scalp and forefront. Shower was exacerbating the symptoms for about 30 min, but a reaction to shampoo and soap were excluded as this was happening even only with water. I took oral antifungal on GP prescription, but nothing changed. Now for the wierd part. I work as a PhD student in preclinical oncology. I often work with mice and I realized that some of the mice I came in contact with were developing red spots. The only difference is that while my spots are slightly swallowed, on the mice they are deep like the outer layer of the skin is missing. The vet said they are not in pain. They seem not to spread the disease (e.g. 6 mice per cage, only 1 with symptoms for several months). This happens only on mice I came in contact with. The spots on mice extend with time up to 20% of the skin surface (for what we observed), but causing no mortality. The mice used here are NMRI nude mice lacking T-linfocytes. I think an atypical dermatitis is not contagious, so how could it be? Could my diagnosis be wrong or are the spots on the mice an uncorrelated thing? Than you in advance for any help!","Doctor":"hi the type of description of your reasons it appears that you are having hives or urticaria. it is a slightly raised red or white lesion which occur on the skin and disappear on its on after few minutes or hours this occur due to allergy to some internal or external agent that maybe water, in case of aquagenic urticaria. had you included a photo I would have helped you more. as far as the lesion in mice are concerned you are saying that outer layer of the skin has gone so it actually appears to be type of skin like necrosis . and in your case there is no such lesion, a typical dermatitis as diagnosed by GP is vague term and general term sometime used when you cannot reach a specific diagnosis. please send a photo if it is due to water note that whenever you touch water to some part of the skin it happens or not. take fexofenadine 120 MG once daily for a week and then tell me how much response you have, you can also take it as per need like alternate day for every 3rd or 4th day. do lot of oiling of the skin, dont use Harsh soaps and avoid any irritant application thankyou"},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, My wife is suffering from peripartum cardiomyopathy for the past six months.

It follows after delivery for a few days to few weeks and manifests with the symptoms of heart failure. Beta blockers and diuretics are suitable. But the condition is not completely curable.

How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method.

It is likely an allergic rhinitis. Dryness is likely due to air conditioning. You should identify the trigger other than air conditioner like exposure to dust, vehicle pollutants or maybe some other trigger, and try to eliminate the exposure.  It is advisable that you continue Momeflo (Mometasone) nasal spray for two weeks at least, but since you already stopped it then should have an antiallergic nasal spray like Azelastine nasal spray two times a day for a week. Also, for dryness, you should use Nasoclear nasal drops (Sodium chloride, Benzalkonium chloride) twice a day which is normal saline nasal drops and you can use it on regular basis for dryness and congestion. Also, for nasal blockages, you may use Xylometazoline nasal drops, a drop in the blocked nose, whenever you are having severe nasal blockages.

A couple of things come to mind when an eye presents like you described red, painful, photophobic. The first one is an eye inflammation, officially called an anterior uveitis. This is usually an isolated incident. It is considered idiopathic, which is just a fancy way of saying we do not know what causes it. If there is a history of this happening before sometimes lab work is ordered to rule out various diseases. Those might include things like Crohn's disease or Sarcoidosis or Spondyloarthritis. For an anterior uveitis there is nothing over the counter (OTC) to treat it. A visit to an eye doctor to confirm this tentative diagnosis is in order. If you are a contact lens wearer this could be a corneal ulcer, those present the same way as an anterior uveitis. Anterior uveitis. Again, there is nothing over the counter for this. If you indeed have an anterior uveitis it would need to be treated with prescription steroid drops. And we need to be careful with steroid drops, if you have an eye infection the steroid will make the eye infection much worse. And steroid drops have other side effects that need to be monitored, they can cause cataracts and they can cause an increase in the eye pressure (putting the patient at risk for glaucoma). Nothing can be done to prevent this. This does not appear to be self-limiting.

My height is 5'7\\" (171 cm), and weight is 135 pounds. Around five months back, I started becoming extremely fatigued and had occasional headaches. As headache was not often and not bad enough, I never really thought much about it. The fatigue was the worst part. It would cause me to become extremely tired throughout the day, and I would be ready to fall asleep at 7 PM every night. Waves of fatigue would come and go. I went to the doctor about this on two occasions for blood tests, and nothing came out of the ordinary. Two months later, I developed a pressure headache in the front of my head one night. It did not feel like a migraine. It was just a terrible pressure mostly centered in my forehead. The feeling was a tightness or like something was pushing on my head. It was frustrating and aggravating. The pressure did not go away for two weeks. It was almost constant, and sometimes the pressure would lessen, but never entirely go away. It would get to the point where I would cry every night because it felt like my head was going to burst open.I went to a neurologist who recommended getting my ferritin levels tested. I had a level of 7, and I was prescribed with Ferrous sulfate and Vitamin C supplement. Over the next six weeks, the fatigue disappeared almost entirely. The headaches seemed to be improving, not constant and not as bad. Again, by last month, the pressure in my forehead began to return. Over the course of a couple of weeks, it became more constant and with higher intensity. I can feel the pressure even when I write this. After a couple of weeks (now), the pressure became just like it was before the ferritin treatment. It is not present all the time, but the majority of the time. I first notice the pressure anywhere from 10 minutes to 1 hour after I wake up. The pressure is often around for so long that it makes me frustrated and moody. My parents think that my headaches have to do with the hormones. In fact, the reason I am so upset is because the headaches have been plaguing me. If the pressure disappeared, I would not be so upset. I am now starting to think that the fatigue and headaches were not related and that the Ferrous sulfate only fixed my fatigue.I went back to the neurologist, and she was very unhelpful. She only spoke to me for less than 10 minutes and asked me what we should do next. She believes that my problem can be fixed with different kinds of medicine and is not looking anywhere else. As of two weeks ago, my ferritin is at a 22, and I am continuing to take it. I tried Topamax for a couple of days before two months, but I stopped because the side effects made me feel five times worse. Two weeks ago, I tried Amitriptyline but stopped that because of the strange side effects. As of four days ago, I have been taking Propranolol, but nothing has changed. The neurologist seems to believe that I have anxiety and this is what is causing my headaches. I have my head screwed on tight as my dad says, and I truly do not have any depression or anxiety. I am not abnormally stressed, and I do well in school. I go back to the neurologist after a month, but I do not think I want to continue seeing her. I am looking for answers. I do not know what else to do. My parents are underestimating me and chalking it up to hormones. These pressure headaches have been plaguing me ever since three months, and it is starting to affect my social life and attitude. I cannot live like this anymore, and I just need help. Any of your advice is appreciated. Thank you.","Doctor":"Hi.

In the last two months, one week he has been housebound and the initial one month, he was completely bedridden. He slipped twice on the first day. That is how it all started. His right leg could not carry the weight of his body. He is approx 110 kg, 6 feet tall. He has had this problem for the last 30 years but he had never been bedridden and the medication worked. He is also diabetic, taking medication for the heart - Eliquis 2.5 mg to reduce the risk of formation of blood clots and he also has varicose veins. On the first day after this started, he took medication himself as per his last prescription. It did not work and after four days, we called the same doctor home who prescribed Insulin, Zocef CV 500 twice 10 days, Levoflox 500 one a day for 10 days and Daflon twice for 15 days. He said to give it nine days before a follow-up. However, after five days since there was no relief and it had started oozing or edema which he noticed when he was sitting up when two visitors came over. The next day, we called another doctor, a diabetologist, as the previous doctor, then said to visit a vascular surgeon as he could not do anything about the oozing. This doctor completely changed the medicines prescribing Linospan 600 twice, Ceftum 500 twice, Chymoral Forte twice along with two other ointments Nadoxin and Betadine and dressing the wounds. This gave immediate relief. He continued the medication for two weeks till the next follow by the same doctor. By this time, the wounds (characterized by oozing, discoloration, swelling) had completely healed except a small hole at the ankle. This time, the doctor prescribed Doxy 100 twice for two weeks and Orni O twice for seven days along with the same ointments. After the end of two weeks, he continued this for a further 10 days after which he was prescribed Dalacin 300 mg for seven days. He took this for around 12 days. Since the last 10 days, he has been taking his own medication - Zocef CV 500, Levoflox 500 and Daflon and at present, he is back to Dalacin 300 since the last two days. He is averse to being admitted to a hospital for the fear of amputation and because he does not want to be admitted to a hospital. He prefers to be treated at home. 10 days ago, my mom also went to our family doctor, who on seeing the pics of the leg said that as per his opinion it required immediate hospitalization and recommended a color doppler of both lower limbs both arterial and venous. My dad cannot walk to get this test done. Please advice. Especially since he is not able to walk beyond the bed to the dining table and for not more than five minutes. Also, particularly why does the leg get swollen off and on now? After taking the antibiotics for so long (now 67 days), does it mean that there is some internal problem? How can it be diagnosed?","Doctor":"Hello. He needs to be seen by a podiatric surgeon, or a surgeon who deals with foot care.  Being an elderly diabetic with limb swelling, it is always safe to get a Doppler (both arterial and venous) of the limbs done. Arterial doppler rules out any block or reduced flow and possibility of pre-gangrene (evolving tissue loss). Venous Doppler rules out varicose veins (which he already has) and also deep vein thrombosis (obstruction of deep veins which is dangerous). This can change the current line of management. Antibiotics can be stopped if there is no evidence of active infection and proper limb care is given. Some general measures you have to follow: You can add some flow modulators like Trental (Pentoxifylline 400 mg twice daily) which can improve blood flow. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines with their consent.

How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

I have thoroughly gone through your case and can well understand your genuine health concerns. 1. No, there is not much problem right now as he vomited and also had a lot of water. It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases. Because, it is a volatile compound and causes vapors entering the lungs through the airways. 3. As it was only two drops, I do not think it may cause much trouble. If he feels short of breath contact me back, otherwise fine. 1. He should avoid re-exposure. 2.

For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations. If the size and number of cysts are more, then I suggest consulting a gynecologist as you may require surgery.

As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses.

Is it necessary for me to use pore minimizer? Are my pimples might be caused by strong products? Do I have to buy stronger products to get rid of my pimples and pimple marks?","Doctor":"Hi. Pimples present on whiteheads, blackheads, abscesses over the face. This is the spectrum of acne vulgaris which is common at a young age. In your case, as you have reported there are active lesions as well as active acne. This occurs due to androgen production during the young age, which leads to sebaceous gland overactivity and their blockage and inflammation. It can be cured by drugs as well as general prevention. General prevention includes avoiding oily things over the face and over the scalp. Avoid steroid creams over the face. Diet has no much role in acne vulgaris. Some cosmetics also increase acne. Drug treatment includes capsule Isotretinoin 20 mg OD with meals at night for four weeks. Clindamycin gel twice daily for four weeks. Salicylic acid 2% face wash use for 30 seconds daily if there is a lot of dryness due to this treatment use salicylic acid face wash only alternate day. Take plenty of fluids. Do not touch the face too often. This treatment sometimes has to be continued for three to four months as per response. When active acne stops coming, acne star are treated according to their type by microsurgery methods. Please review after four weeks with photo. I do not advise taking any other extra tonics, oils, or any food supplements as they can increase acne. I hope this helps"},{"Patient":"Hello doctor,My mother is suffering from breast cancer.

Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases.

For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations. If the size and number of cysts are more, then I suggest consulting a gynecologist as you may require surgery.

As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses.

Admittedly, I do not have the best posture. During most of the day I am working and standing. I have a stressful lifestyle, but I am experiencing the pain even on vacation. I do not have weight loss, fever, chills, neurologic symptoms, etc. It distracts me from my daily life. The pain is a constant dull ache or tension and is located medially, extending from C7 to the bottom borders of my scapulae. It feels like it is just lateral to my spinous processes, maybe in the laminar groove or maybe even at the zygapophyseal joints. At times I find that I can take a deep breath and even this causes my back to crack, although it is not painful. I regularly receive massages, which helped at first but no longer provide any relief. The only thing that provides relief is extreme extension of my spine, often by lying on a pair of tennis balls, foam roller or upside down from a chair. Even this does not feel like enough to relieve the tension. The maneuver which gives me the most relief is having my back cracked by a friend wrapping my arms around my shoulders and being picked up.

How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

These are my recommendations: Diet- Your daily diet should include one bowl of fresh fruits, preferably the ones rich in Iron and Calcium like pomegranate, papaya, sapota, guava, figs, dates, raisins, muskmelon, gooseberry. You can take one bowl of these fruits, individually or mixed every day. Proteins are essential for hair growth and energy, includes eggs, pulses, and cheese in your daily diet. Ensure you eat at the right time daily so that digestion and metabolism improves. Almonds, pumpkin seeds are also highly recommended. Exercise- to regain energy and to improve blood circulation exercise is a must. 30 minutes for brisk walk, cycling or yoga for five days a week. Medicine- Aswagandharishtam, this is a wonderful Ayurveda preparation which will target all your problems comprehensively. This is prepared using 20 odd herbs which comprehensively target all your issues- stress, weakness, hairfall, and headache. Take 5 ml of this tonic diluted in 15 ml water twice daily after food.

How can I overcome this situation? I masturbate when I think about it. In the past, I used to suffer from thoughts that all the girls cheat and use boys for their benefit.","Doctor":"Hello. I completely understand that you feel concerned about negative thoughts coming in your mind related to your wife and girls in general. There might be negative experiences related to opposite gender which might have a negative influence on your mind and you have developed such beliefs which cause interpersonal difficulties with your wife in current situations. The first thing you can do to change your beliefs is to go in depth to your past experiences that are affecting your present relationship. We relive past experiences and deal according to unhealthy copings we had developed in the past to deal with traumatic experiences in the present. This always has a negative influence on our present. You are suggested to base your perceptions according to your current life circumstances, avoid comparisons with past life because it will make your present and future worse. Secondly, as you experience negative thoughts such as 'my wife will be in an extramarital affair and get back with her boyfriend', you need to understand that these thoughts are just the product of your mind and might not be the reality. As you do not find proofs, your mind will be ready to change these thoughts. Just change them with positive/neutral thoughts such as \\"she is with me and has no reason to be with anyone. She is married to me, as she is getting along with me, and she loves me\\". This is just an example. You can suggest your own positive thoughts in your own wordings. Just practice these thoughts whenever the negative thoughts pop-up in your mind. Gradually your mind will start believing and you will develop healthy beliefs and thoughts which will positively influence your relationship with wife. I hope this is helpful for you.

I have thoroughly gone through your case and can well understand your genuine health concerns. 1. No, there is not much problem right now as he vomited and also had a lot of water. It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases. Because, it is a volatile compound and causes vapors entering the lungs through the airways. 3. As it was only two drops, I do not think it may cause much trouble. If he feels short of breath contact me back, otherwise fine. 1. He should avoid re-exposure. 2. Rule out if there is some sort of suicidal ideation due to depression or anxiety and take him to a psychiatrist for physical evaluation.

I used it for 30 days continuously, but no use. How many days should I take that powder and how to overcome this problem?","Doctor":"Hello. For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations. If the size and number of cysts are more, then I suggest consulting a gynecologist as you may require surgery. If the number and size of cysts are less, you may continue treatment along with syrup Evecare 10 ml BD and Kanchnar Guggulu two BD.

She had taken my blood sample and it was negative. But, still I have not gotten my periods and it has been a week ahead. What could be the reason for my late periods?","Doctor":"Hello. As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses.

Today, I went to the pharmacy to go get another three months supply of Yasmin but the pharmacist gave me Elvina and told me it was the equivalent to Yasmin but I am worried to take Elvina because my body is used to taking Yasmin. I am wondering will it be fine to take this?","Doctor":"Hi. It is nice to hear from you that you are concerned about medication type before its use. You are a teenager, still under development stage of the reproductive system. Yasmin (Drospirenone) already you used and are satisfied as well. Elvina is also a combination of two hormones (Drospirenoneone, Ethinyl Estradiol and folate). It has been used for premenstrual syndrome, patients need folate, teenagers above 15 years of age with acne, etc. It is up to you either you want to continue with Yasmin or Elvina. But consider one point regarding contraceptives that it is better to avoid similar contraceptive for a long time to reduce side effects like short term and long term like mood variations, cycles irregularity, headache, high blood pressure, stroke, clot formation, endometrial hyperplasia, and breast cancer, etc. The side effects differ in each individual. You can exchange Elvina if you want for your satisfaction as both of these drugs are combinations of hormones with more or less similar side effects.

Our family friend suggested me to consume Kalarchikai medicine, powdered mixed with pepper and honey to have it for one mandalam (48 days). I have completed nearly 44 days by consuming one small ball of the mixture every morning and before two weeks I got my periods. Then I had checked whether the cysts were dissolved by having an abdomen scan. But still, small multiple follicules have been seen in it with both ovaries enlarged. Kindly suggest me what I can do further. I got married before one and a half years and I am much worried about my pregnancy. I have gallstones as well.","Doctor":"Hello. I just read your query. See Kalarachi Kai choornam is helpful in amenorrhea. As far as small cysts are concerned they are unmatured eggs which failed to induce menstrual cycle previously, as a result, they got collected in the ovary and they will remain in the ovary. Now, you have got your periods you can start trying for conception. But I advise you to do it under the supervision of a nearby gynecologist because egg size is important while conception and that you can know by ovulation study. Ovulation study is performed under the supervision of a gynecologist. For gall stones, surgical intervention is required generally.

I am used to smoke, but I quit when I was diagnosed. Recently, after a stressful situation I fell off the wagon for the first time since I was diagnosed and bought a pack of cigarettes. I did not smoke the whole pack, just a few. But, I started seeing vision changes and that seems to correlate with it. There are no floaters or flashes, but I have had this constant spot in my right eye for the past month or so. It looks exactly like the imprint light can leave in your eyes after staring at the sun or a light bulb for a long time and then looking away. It has been constantly there and never fades. It feels almost like this one section of my vision is more sensitive to light. It has got progressively more prominent. It was faint at first, but now it is very obvious and distracting when I am reading or working at the computer. It does not obstruct my vision and it is just incredibly distracting me. It is in a crescent shape. It is most obvious when I am working on the computer screen and then look away to a darker background. Also, when I blink rapidly, I see it and it almost looks like a strobe light. I had a dilated eye examination this morning and the ophthalmologist told me that there were no signs of bleeding or edema in my eyes. He said the vision changes I described were not a cause for concern, but at the same time he was not able to explain why I am seeing this. It is causing me a particular concern because once it started and I smoked another cigarette, it seemed to become more prominent, brighter, and more obvious in my field of vision. That really freaked me out and caused me to throw the rest of the pack away immediately. I have had pretty decent blood sugar control and all of my A1Cs have been in the 5.5 to 6.5 range since I was diagnosed initially. I take Adderall 25 mg for ADD and NovoLog. Is this a cause for concern? I was not able to find anything related to that type of vision change on the internet. I would really like to get an idea of what causes this type of thing for peace of mind and figure out if it is worth seeing a retina specialist.","Doctor":"Hi. Most likely, it is not something to be alarmed about. Unexplained visual phenomena. Follow up appointment in six weeks. Stop smoking and manage diabetes.

Since my period date was clashing with my wedding date, I had to take some medicine in order to postpone my period. My normal period cycle is 27 or 28 days, but in the last few months due to stress and exertion, I had been getting my period 5 or 6 days early. So, during the last month, I expected my period to arrive early, but that did not happen. So, I took the pill for delaying my period and unfortunately, I got my period the very next day that is four days before my marriage. My husband ejaculated right after he touched me down there. He did not even enter inside. Still, to be on the safe side, I took an I-pill the very next morning that is within less than 10 hours. So, in a span of a week from the commencement of my period till the end, I consumed two different types of medicines. I did not get my period the next month. So, I took two home pregnancy tests and luckily both the times, I got negative results. As it got delayed for 10 days, I visited a gynecologist to assure the reason behind the delay is hormonal imbalance or if I am pregnant. My gynecologist suggested an ultrasound and I got it done the same day. As per the reports I have got two follicular cysts sized as below. Right ovary 4.5 × 3.2 cm cyst size 37 × 30 mm, left ovary 3.9 ×2.3 cm and cyst size 22 × 18 mm. My uterus size is 7.6 × 4.6 × 3.2 cm. The doctor suggested that I am not pregnant as per the reports. The doctor prescribed medicine named Deviry for the withdrawal of my period. I took the medication twice a day for five days. The doctor suggested that I will get period any time within five days from the last tablet. But, I have not got them yet. I am really concerned if anything else is wrong inside or those cysts are growing. Please help me come out of this mess. I would like to know a few things. Is it fine to have intercourse with my husband? What is the ultimate option to resume my period and get rid of those two cysts? Are there any chances of those cysts harming my uterus? Please suggest me the right course of action. Thank you in advance.","Doctor":"Hello. I have read and understood your query. Let me explain you that you do not have any major problem and you will get relieved by the treatment itself. Yes, you can have intercourse now at least. You have taken Deviry (Medroxyprogesterone) for five days. Actually, you should have your period within 10 days after stopping the tablets. So, do not worry. You will get your period. Just have to wait for five more days. Within five days you will get your period if what you have written is right and you have taken tablet course on time. Secondly, you have very small sized ovarian cyst. Do one sonography on day 3 of your period and if both cysts are there then you need to take treatment for cyst, otherwise they are gone with Deviry only. If they persist on day 3 sonography, then consult your doctor. He or she may prescribe Novelon (Desogestrel and Ethinylestradiol) or like tablets for 21 days straight and have a gap of seven days and start other packet of 21 tablets for three months. This will end the cyst if it is a simple cyst as per the sonographic finding. For further information consult an obstetrician and gynaecologist online -->"},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I am 19 years old. I have been living with persistent allergies in my whole life. I have chronic post-nasal drip. I have lost my voice and get some sort of sore throat, whether that be laryngitis or strep throat. I had the same thing thrice in the past three months. This is especially difficult because I sing in my school's advanced chorus. In addition, because of the chronic post-nasal drip, I have to clear my throat a lot. My sinuses are congested frequently. Over-the-counter drugs provide temporary relief, but I have reached a point where I am tired of taking Mucinex or Benadryl every couple of days. I was wondering if I am a good candidate for sinus surgery. My mother and grandmother have both suffered from similar symptoms in the past and they both have had the surgery. It has seemed to help them overcome about 85% of their previous issues. Please help me. Thank you.","Doctor":"Hi. As you said, you have chronic post-nasal drip with a change of voice. According to me, it is chronic sinusitis with chronic laryngopharyngitis. The diagnosis of chronic sinusitis must be confirmed and I suggest you get a CT PNS (paranasal sinus) done and send me the pictures. For now, I suggest a Fluticasone nasal spray twice daily, tablet Montair LC (Montelukast and Levocetirizine) once daily and capsule Pantoprazole once daily. Also, take steam inhalation and avoid high pitch singing while you have a sore throat. One more thing, I want to know is that whether your voice has become hoarse or you cannot sing because you have a feeling of a dry throat.

It may be due to thyroid disease, anxiety, heart disease, blood pressure or many other reasons. You need to consult your cardiologist for proper evaluation of the cause and to treat that accordingly. Diagnosis is the first step and that need proper and thorough diagnostics. Usually taking Atenolol 50 mg once daily may suffice the need to relieve the symptoms.

How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

I have gone through the reports (attachment removed to protect patient identity) and in your case, PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease) is not a problem for delayed menses, but high prolactin levels due to hyperprolactinemia. PCOD can be controlled with diet, exercise and weight loss and even with Cyproterone oral contraceptive pills, but menses would not regularize and ovulation would also be irregular if the prolactin levels are not under control at all. I suggest you dopamine agonists like Cabergoline, twice a week for three to four weeks to bring down the prolactin levels. Presently, I believe you have been given progesterone pills for initiating withdrawal bleed, but just mere 3 pills of even Primolut-N are insufficient to initiate a bleed. Hence, you have not received a withdrawal at all. Wait for another five days and if menses do not occur, then you should be started on Primolut-N 5 mg twice a day for five days at least and then withdrawal should be expected in the next 5 to 7 days from the day of the last pill intake.

But after medicine intake period is over, loose motions and stomach cramps in my lower left side continues. I'm very much disappointed by the way i lost so much money without treating the core of my problem which i Don't know as i don't have such equipments at home nor the medical qualifications to treat myself.

Most of whom have undergone upper Gi endoscopy and lower Gi Colonoscopy and some have found to have irritable bowel syndrome. Which is often missed if it is of the mild form . It will be apparent on a colonoscopy only when it gets severe. I see from your treatment history you have been treated for colitis or the infection of the bowel which is usually the most common diagnosis and subsides after the antibiotics . In your case as it is chronic I would suggest a closer look And further investigation so starting with the simplest stool fOb , stool for Ova test. If both of them are inconsistent then we may think of IRRITABLE BOWEL SYNDROME. you will have to modify your diet and find out if you have any food allergies avoid any kind of spicy diet and certainly avoid RED meat for the time being . I will also prescribe a medication which you can take it twice a day for a week and follow up . i would like to know if you had had any previous surgeries. Follow up with the stools tests ."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor,I am trying to conceive but my husband and I did cocaine a week ago. How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

I have thoroughly gone through your case and can well understand your genuine health concerns. 1. No, there is not much problem right now as he vomited and also had a lot of water. It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases.

For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations.

As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses.

What are the side effects? Is there any other option with no side effects to avoid pregnancy for two years?","Doctor":"Hi. Ovral pills (combination of Ethinyl estradiol and Levonorgestrel) are 100 % reliable if taken regularly. They have very few side effects and can be taken same time every day. If you miss one tablet it is okay, but if missed twice, can lead to failure in that particular month. No other contraceptive method matches it. You can use the Multiload but only after first pregnancy. It is used for 3 or 5 years depending on the brand. Implant are also available which is inserted under the skin by a small operation over forearm. The advantage is you do not have to take tablets. I suggest you do the following tests. So, choose according to your convenience and future plans. Feel free to consult for any problem.

What is the treatment?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? I saw the image, but it is not clear (attachment removed to protect patient identity). But, based on how much ever I could appreciate, it seems you have deep caries in your first molar and to some extent nearby second premolar too. The crack or sharpness is due to the loss of tooth structure because of caries (cavity). Kindly take an IOPA (intraoral periapical radiograph) of both the teeth together (in one X-ray itself) and send it to me, along with a clear image of your teeth to help you with a proper diagnosis and treatment plan. Do you have or had pain, especially during chewing or sleeping? The treatment plan will vary based on the diagnosis. If the cavity has reached the pulp (blood supply of tooth), it will need a root canal treatment followed by a crown. If it is approximating the pulp, then we will give a temporary filling, wait for a month and if there are no symptoms, then we will change it to a permanent filling (restoration). If it is not even approximating pulp and is in dentin or just enamel (hard structures of teeth), then we will straight away go for permanent restoration (tooth filling). All these will eventually treat your cavity and the sharpness and the gap will go away. Kindly send me a clear picture and the radiograph to help you precisely. Take care.

A week after this, I started having gas in my stomach and feeling strange and this continues till today. Ten days after this exposure and after I drank a liter of milk, I had diarrhea. The next day I ate, 20 minutes later I went to the toilet. Since then, I did not have such problem but whenever I am eating something I have this feeling that I need to go to the toilet and my stomach is \\"playing all over.\\" But, I did not have any symptoms of diarrhea. Also, I never had a fever during this period. Five days ago, I started having a headache and my nose was full and I was coughing like I had a kind of virus and I did not know if it was correlated with my symptoms in my stomach. I still have the feeling that I need to go to the toilet but when I go, it is either the gas or the normal stool. On day 15 after the possible exposure, I went to a clinic and I had done an HIV third generation test and the result was negative. When I asked the doctor what kind of test was that he mentioned to me the third generation but enforced which is equal or better than the fourth generation and this is what the doctor told me. My worries are if I have been infected with HIV by performing fingering and only that, and if my symptoms are related to that and if not what else might be. I am going today to give a sample of my stool for culture to see if I have any virus or anything else. In two weeks from today, my wife and I have decided to do an in vitro fertilization and therefore I am worried if the above are interlinked and I need to take any other action. Finally, my other question is linked to the latter. If I will take any antibiotics now for my stomach if they find also something in my stool and in two weeks, I need to give semen for the in vitro fertilization is this fine or the antibiotics will affect the quality of the semen? Should I do anything else with reference to my possible exposure to fingering?","Doctor":"Hello. There is really no chance of HIV (human immunodeficiency virus) infection through just fingering the vagina as the virus is unable to pass through intact skin. There is not even a need to screen for HIV if fingering is the only physical activity that you have performed. Your stomach issues are perhaps due to indigestion and lactose intolerance. Milk and dairy products are a common cause of lactose intolerance. You can avoid dairy products for a while. I do not see any issues with your scheduled IVF (in vitro fertilization) procedure.

I hope you had a positive pregnancy test. Or you had a scan showing the gestation sac. I mean to say that I hope pregnancy was confirmed. The ideal step after confirming a pregnancy inside the uterus is to have tablet Mifepristone 200 mg orally. This will dislodge a pregnancy from the uterine lining. You will not have any bleeding, only mild abdominal cramps and features of gastritis. After 48 hours of this pill, that is after complete dislodging of the embryo has occurred, tablet Misoprostol 200 mcg 2 to 3 tablets have to be taken orally or vaginally after wetting it. Bleeding will start after this, it may take 2 to 3 days after the pill. If still no bleeding, you have to doubt if you were really pregnant. Now all you need to do is wait for 1 to 2 days. If still no bleeding, check urine if you are pregnant. (Pregnancy test is positive one day after missed period). Do not take Mefipristone without confirmation of pregnancy inside the uterus, if in the tube, you will bleed internally). Have scan to see for pregnancy inside the uterus after two weeks. Then repeat this schedule."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor,I am 21. I am suffering from dark circles and fine lines and wrinkles around eyes even with dark facial hairs and loose facial skin. In short, I am finding signs of premature aging, hair greying, and excessive hair loss. Please please help me out.","Doctor":"Hello. I understand you have been suffering from the signs of premature aging. The most common cause for this is lack of sleep and very stressful life. Firstly, I would advise you to take proper rest and sleep every day for seven to eight hours and try to manage or reduce the stress in your life. Secondly, eat lots of fruits and nuts like almonds, cashews, and other dry fruits. And try the homeopathic remedies like 5 Phos three tablets twice a day for 15 days. These tablets are chewable so no need to take it with water. Just keep them over your tongue and it will melt on its own. This medicine will help reduce your stress and also would help to get rid of signs of premature aging. I hope you start feeling better. Kindly update me in 15 days.

My TSH was 1.5 and FT4 1.1, so normal function. Two months ago, I started having palpitations and tested my thyroid again. TSH was 0.0018 (suppressed), FT4 2.66 and FT3 7.8. I was hyperthyroid, so I had the TRAb test and it was 5.9. So, I was diagnosed with Graves' and overt hyperthyroidism. I was put on 15 mg Methimazole and 6 weeks later retested my thyroid and my results are, TSH 0.0026, FT4 0.86. So, normal but low range and FT3 is 2.8. Over the last 2-3 days including before these tests, I started having a nasty dull head pressure and lack of focus, similar to what I have had a couple of years ago when my TSH came out 4.1. I also had fatigue and brain fog, which I do not have now. I feel this pressure or tension around my ears, nose, head and throat. I feel my jaw and upper throat tense, had nightmares, irascible and emotionally unstable. It all started rather suddenly. Can it be thyroid related? It is my only known health issue. I do not feel sick and I do not have fever too. But, this sensation in my head and throat annoys me and makes me very anxious. Could it be related to my FT4 going too low? And why is my TSH still suppressed? Why should not it rise with this FT4? Are the TRAb antibodies keeping it suppressed? I will now half my Methimazole dosage to 7.5 mg per day for another three weeks and test again. Does this sound right? Do you have any other advice for me with these symptoms and test results? Please let me know if you need any more information. Thank you so much.","Doctor":"Hi.

I have prior HSV 1. I had no other symptoms but bad pain. I had pain in the penis and testicles. Now three months after I have a tingle in upper thighs and pelvis when laying down at night. Lymph nodes in groin never swelled but I can noticeably feel them in the groin and are tender after sex or to touch. I have been painful for years on and off though but not as bad as now. I have tingle weird feeling in testicles when sitting down during the day. No outbreaks ever. I am thinking and scared it is HSV 2. What is going on? IGM and IGG are negative six weeks after sexual encounter. What else could possibly be causing this?","Doctor":"Hi. Generalized body aches are most probably not due to any STD (sexually transmitted disease). If there is no swollen lymph node again it is not STD. HSV 2 (herpes simplex virus) do not present like that. it has blisters which periodically you should not worry about that. If there is no burning micturation, no discharge from the urethral opening, no itching over the penis, no ulceration on the penis it is probably not STD. But still, you should avoid unprotected sex. For these symptoms you can take Paracetamol tablet SOS, Azithromycin 500 mg once daily for five days and show to the physician as these are medical symptoms."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor,I am trying to conceive but my husband and I did cocaine a week ago. How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

I want to assure you not to worry as everything is going to be fine if proper care and treatment is opted in for. I have thoroughly gone through your case and can well understand your genuine health concerns. 1. No, there is not much problem right now as he vomited and also had a lot of water. It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases. Because, it is a volatile compound and causes vapors entering the lungs through the airways. 3. As it was only two drops, I do not think it may cause much trouble. If he feels short of breath contact me back, otherwise fine. 1. He should avoid re-exposure. 2.

For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations. If the size and number of cysts are more, then I suggest consulting a gynecologist as you may require surgery.

As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses.

And if yes what I can do to correct it?","Doctor":"Hi. You have a tight prepuce that does not retract. Your preputial orifice is not so narrow as to cause difficulty in urination. However, you run the risk of paraphimosis in which your foreskin may get retracted and form a constriction ring causing the glans to swell. This occurs after intercourse.

These four main symptoms all take place at the same time and have been enduring for months. On multiple occasions, the symptoms have become so severe that I have had to go to the hospital/ER. I have seen many doctors and I have had many tests done and nobody can figure out what is wrong with me. The symptoms came on acute starting four months ago. The four main symptoms definitely appear to correspond with and be exacerbated by my eating and they come on severe after eating certain foods or big meals (but I cannot figure it out). For the record, here are all of my symptoms: daily debilitating shortness of breath that fluctuates in severity (worse with humidity or any kind of exertion), chest soreness, intermittent sore throat, intermittent nasal stuffiness without phlegm, jitteriness, anxiety, panic, jaw clicking, depression, hair falling out, poor attention span, inability to concentrate and confusion, weakness, extreme fatigue, excessive morning urination, intermittent stabbing back pain and head pain, occasional entire body itching, previous cough and congestion, previous trouble swallowing, nausea, and severe weight loss in 11 weeks (32 lbs).I have been to the ER three times in 90 days with suspected pneumonia, swallowing problems, two seizures (from mixing the medicines with my Dilantin) and suspected heart attack (which the head doctors at Franklin Square disagree with each other about. I had slightly elevated troponin levels when I had my seizures. The head cardiologist says the elevated troponin levels were from my seizures, and the head neurologist says seizures cannot cause elevated troponin levels.) I also had a cardiac catheterization and afterwards, the surgeon came out and made it very clear I did not have a heart attack. These are all the tests I have had done (all these tests came back negative while some showed a small issue here or there): Swallowing test (all fine).Strep test (all fine).Thyroid test (all fine).IgE Test (all fine).Pulmonary function test (all fine).Flexible fiberoptic laryngoscopy (all fine except some vocal folding).Chest X-ray (all fine). (it looked like there was a prior infection in the lower left lung).CBC (all fine). (cholesterol was high, has since gone down a little).Head and chest CAT scans (all fine). (3 mm triangular pleural-based nodule of the right upper lobe. This likely represents an intraparenchymal lymph node. Diffuse thickening of the adrenal glands, likely related to hyperplasia. In addition, there is an indeterminate 1.5 cm nodule. The left adrenal gland. Left adrenal gland nodule of indeterminate nature. This may represent an adenoma, though would be more definitively evaluated with adrenal protocol MRI or CT).Cardiac catheterization (all fine). (Surgeon: no heart attack. Paperwork: acute non-Q wave myocardial infarction).Endoscopy w/ biopsies (showed mild esophagitis and duodenitis).Hypersensitivity pneumonitis (showed elevated penicillium levels. I am allergic to penicillin).EKGs after seizures (normal sinus rhythm, pulmonary disease pattern, left axis deviation, RSR or QR pattern in v1 suggests right ventricular conduction delay, incomplete right bundle branch block, left anterior fascicular block, ST and T wave abnormality, consider anterior ischemia, abnormal ECG).Family History: Father: Heart Disease, Diabetes.Mother: Hypertension, Diabetes.Siblings: Four Siblings Diabetes.I have been seen by two internists, two GIs, two ENTs, two pulmonologists and a neurologist. I have been prescribed PPI’s, Zantec, Dilantin, Xanax, Lexapro, Prednisone, three inhalers and OTC Gaviscon, Tums, Benadryl, Tylenol, and Ibuprofen. Currently I am only taking three medications: Xanax (0.25 mg/day), Lexapro (10 mg/day), and Dilantin (400 mg/day).I used to think all this was from severe acid reflux (GERD), but my latest theory is that it is all from mold exposure (and I am quite convinced about this). I got sick at my workplace two years ago with four respiratory infections in three months when the old HVAC system was jerry-rigged by technicians. At that time, my employer installed two air purifiers and I covered the vent with multiple layers of cheesecloth. Since then, the workplace was tested for mold and they reported two colonies of Penicillium. I have written proof from the DLLR that I was exposed to the mold Penicillium at my workplace (where there was a substantial water leak in the ceiling above my head). I am allergic to penicillin. Four months ago, I removed the cheesecloth to replace it and was not wearing a mask. This is when all this started. What do you think? Please let me know if you believe this could be from the mold, or if you have any other theories.","Doctor":"Hello. Take care.

Usually, she will have the bleeding with thick dark blood seven to 10 days of the pill. Having a bleed after the pill means the inner lining of the uterus has gone.

If colposcopy evaluation by endocervical biopsy and curettage is done completely and the doctor might recommend you excision, then further follow-ups by recurrent pap smear and maybe biopsies can be done, if needed.

My doctors say that I have to come off them, and I am terrified of what effect it will have on my body. What will be my periods be like? The doctor thinks that the pills are affecting my menopause. I am so scared of what the bleeding will be like, and I cannot cope.","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? I really do not see any reason for you to worry. I feel you are taking those pills unnecessarily. By 50 to 54 years, all ladies enter their menopause. This is a time when all follicles in the ovaries are exhausted and the hormone supply to the inner lining of the uterus is so low that bleeding will not occur at all. This is menopause. But if you keep having these tablets, you are artificially increasing the thickness every month and artificially bleeding by stopping every month. Nothing will happen, just stop the pills, you may have one normal period due to the tablets, then as your body is not producing any further hormone, the inner lining will stay thin and you will not have any more periods. To confirm this, after 2 to 3 weeks of periods, without taking any medications, get a pelvic scan done and note the endometrial thickness. Any thickness of less than 4 mm is normal. I am sure it will be so. You will not have any periods thereafter. To confirm the same in blood, you can test serum AMH (anti-mullerian hormone), the normal level is 1.1 to 3.5 ng/mL. But, if there are no follicles to produce any hormones, blood values will be less than 0.5 ng/mL. If there was some other cause for heavy bleeding, you would not have succeeded in stopping the bleeding with just Norethisterone. So, just cheer up. Just stop the medication, you will do fine. I would advise you to start Calcium and Vitamin D3 tablets to reduce the risk of osteoporosis, which is a risk in every lady after menopause.

Do you have blurring of vision or double vision? 2. Do you have neck rigidity? ( you will feel like stiffness and pain in back of neck, you won't be able to touch your chest with chin) if any of the above is there, please consult locally as early as possible to your GP/Neurologist, if above things are not then you need to do two things 1. Get on MRI brain with contrast done to look for infective focus or parenchymal lesion. 2. Get your Eyes checked for pappiloedema to look for raised intracranial pressure. meanwhile you can take pantoprazole and domperdon (pantocid - D) before breakfast take tablet Naproxen 500mg (in place of Medicol ) when required for headache thank you"},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, My period usually comes on the 6th every month, but I did not get my periods of this month. In fact, I forgot it because I did not have any usual cramps like I would. I started feeling weird and having a few pregnancy like symptoms such as nausea, fatigue, headaches and my nose started to get sensitive. A few days passed and I still had no cramps or period. I took two pregnancy tests and they were negative. I went to my gynecologist and had one more pregnancy test. That too came back as negative. I did have problem of UTI and I am now getting treatment for that. I started spotting a day after and the blood went from brown to bright pink to red. Then it started getting heavier, but no cramps. Then I went to the bathroom and a blood clot passed through my urine and the toilet bowl filled with blood. I do not really have the pregnancy symptoms as much as I did before, but what could this be?","Doctor":"Hello. As the pregnancy tests were negative even after eight days post missed menses, it ensures that you are not pregnant. The symptoms you had were common PMS symptoms (premenstrual syndrome), which subsides slowly once the menses start. There is a possibility that a large endometrial chunk would have got passed out during the start of the flow due to delayed menses this time. So, just allow the menses to continue and you should be fine. The chunk was definitely not a gestational sac or pregnancy, as the pregnancy tests were negative.

Since one and a half years, I have been taking tablet Quetiapine 25 mg and tablet Lithoril 400 mg twice a day. Also, I am taking tablet Prodep 10 mg once in the morning for depression and border line personality disorder. During that period, I was even administered CBT. But, sometimes I get anxious and also depressed. My profession is teaching at the graduation level and I was clearly admired by my students. I teach with great enthusiasm, never get angry or show any reckless behavior and treat everyone with respect. After knowing my problem my wife left me. In the beginning, I did get a little frightened, but moved on with time and believe in living my life to the fullest. I exercise daily for 1 hour. I have been a scholar since childhood and was very excited. The tablet Quetiapine 25 mg is making me feel very drowsy as a result of which I sleep for about 9 hours a day. Initially, I thought it was because of depression. But, now I do not feel so. I am not sure whether I have borderline personality disorder or not. Am I taking right medication? Should I continue with the same? I do not want to get trapped. It would be of great help. Because, even to this day psychiatric issues are considered a taboo in our society.

That time, I was left with a small hole in the skull after extradural hematoma evacuation. Then, I had no discomfort in the head. Now, I have terrible tension around the back of the head and dull pressure and pain next to the hole. I feel hyperemotional, frightened, extreme anxiety and jaw clenching. I had none of these for seven months post surgery. Is it safe to live with this hole? What is underneath it? Will it affect my life? Why am I getting sudden extreme head tension and dull aches? From yesterday, I am taking beta blockers for stress and tension. My neurologist said that I am free from brain damage. But, I need more advice.","Doctor":"Hi. A small piece of the skull bone could be cut and the hole in the bone was made. According to the reports (attachment removed to protect patient identity), there is no residual brain damage. Under these circumstances, I can explain your headache as follows. The pain around the burr hole may be due to fibrosis and scar formation, which makes the scalp tough. Skin traction around the burr hole may be due to this scar formation. Treatment is usually symptomatic with pain medications. The headache may also be related to post-traumatic stress disorder. You should see a psychiatrist for diagnosis and therapy. Treatment may include antidepressants and behavioral therapy. Given that there is no evidence of residual head injury, your headache may be unrelated to the prior injury. It may simply be tension headache, which is very common. Treatment is with pain medications and avoiding the stressors.

Sometimes I also feel a slight pain in the anus in the area of operation. Please suggest if it is fine or some problem is there.","Doctor":"Hello. You must know and remember that anal fistula is a condition which has got fairly high recurrence rate, meaning it has a tendency to occur again after the operation. Complete cure is very difficult. I strongly suspect that you have got fistula-in-ano again. Please consult your treating surgeon for the same. There can also be some conditions in which there is a high rate of recurrence of fistula if not treated primarily such as tuberculosis, Crohn's disease, malignancy, etc. You can ask your doctor regarding the same. 1.Failure of operative treatment. 2.Underlying secondary causes. 1.MRI fistulogram. 2.Investigations for suspected secondary causes. 1.Recurrent fistula-in-ano. 2.Perianal abscess. 1.Investigate the fistula. 2.Rule out secondary causes. 3.Treat the underlying secondary cause if any. 4.Operate if fistula persists. 1.Maintain anal hygiene. 2.Regular sitz bath.

But, since two months he has not been taking tablets at night (Arpizol 10 mg). The reason is that unknowingly he is masturbating in sleep. He was in spiritual path where the act is considered as a sin. So, he is refusing to consume tablets at night. I tried to convince him a lot, but he is not listening to the doctor's words too. The situation is getting worse. He is getting inferiority complex and becoming violent. Also, he is not ready to get treated by the doctor. He said that he does not want to stay at home and absconded once. He returned home after a day. All the people in office are laughing at him with his abnormal behavior; I cannot admit him in the hospital forcefully as he will become violent. Kindly help me in this case. His current medication includes Prodep 20 mg in the morning and Arpizol 10 mg at night. Is the problem being due to the tablets? If it so, can we change the medicine?","Doctor":"Hi. I have read your query with keen interest and understand your concerns. Presence of aggressive behavior, not taking medicines and feeling that people are laughing at him along with the history of wandering tendency clearly indicates that he is slowly developing symptoms of schizophrenia, which is probably due to medicine discontinuation. It will be wrong to say that it is due to medication, but it is right to say that such behavior was prevented for last few years with the use of medication.  This is also possible that 10 mg of Aripiprazole was not enough to control his symptoms. I understand his aggression, but it is better to start his treatment even in a covert manner if necessary. In addition, these days lots of depot preparation is available. It can be administered at the interval of two to four weeks, thus increasing compliance to treatment and response of the patient.

I was offered for level two ultrasound on the same day. Other than echogenic bowel, I had a normal scan. After that, I was suggested for the quadruple test, which came back low risk (1:2226). At my 19 week ultrasound, echogenic bowel was still present but not that much bright seen than the 17th-week scan. So, we were referred for genetic counseling. Genetic counseller also performed a detailed scan and told that everything was normal but there was mild echogenic bowel present. She told that due to an infection that it may happen. So I had a TORCH test. In that result, everything was within normal range except CMV IgG. My CMV IgG was 83.7. Will this CMV cause echogenic bowel in the baby? WIll it affect the baby's health? I am very much worried about this result. So I did amniocentesis this week. The result has not yet come. Will amniocentesis identify the infection in the baby? Please explain.","Doctor":"Hello. You have undergone level two ultrasound twice by radiologist and geneticists. So, you need not worry. Your triple marker report shows low risk which means there is 99.99 percent no problem. The TORCH (toxoplasmosis, other infections, rubella, cytomegalovirus, and herpes simplex) test shows CMV (cytomegalovirus) IgG (immunoglobulin G) positive. It is of no significance as it indicates a past infection before pregnancy and you have already gained immunity against that so it is not the cause for any infection. Amniocentesis you have already done it. You can request the generic counselor for karyotype of the sample taken. It will rule out any chromosomal anomaly. It takes nearly three weeks for karyotype report to come. For more information consult an obstetrician and gynecologist online -->"},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, A dog tried to bite me on the road.

I was diagnosed with retinal ischemia by an eye specialist and after an angiogram he suspects a small crystal of plaque to be blocking the blood supply to a portion of my retina.

How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases.

For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations.

She went to the doctor's appointment a couple of days ago she was advised to terminate the pregnancy. I do not understand the details but they said she has an antibody titer level of 100.

She is Rh negative and husband Rh-positive but is it known that he is homozygous or heterozygous for anti-D allele? If homozygous, then the baby would be Rh-negative and more chances of complications but if heterozygous, need more chorionic villus sampling or amniocentesis to know child's blood group. Was the previous child's blood group known? Was it positive or negative? Antibody titer 1:4 considered as alloimmunized where as needed monthly antibody titer whereas antibody titer of 1:16 need strict monitoring. The baby has more chances of having fetal anemia, hydrops fetalis, jaundice, etc., and need twice weekly titer. Any chronic health issue she has? If yes, have a complete check-up and treatment for that as well. It is better to discuss the case with titer report and repeat it again from authentic laboratory so that you can have more genuine results. Serial scan and antibody titer in pregnancy with anti-D advised in 28 and 32 weeks and in case of fetomaternal hemorrhage as well is advised actually.

A condom would be a good option, as it avoids any semen into your vagina, so no chances of pregnancy. It also avoids transmission of any infections, not just STDs (sexually transmitted diseases). There are no hormones involved, your hormonal balance is not disturbed and periods will be as before. But if you want the emergency contraceptive pill, then I suggest you try using I-pill or Unwanted 72. These pills are a high dose of progesterone hormone, the same hormone which is produced in your body in the second half of the period after ovulation. This pill will suddenly increase the thickness of your inner lining of the uterus, making it unfavorable for a possible pregnancy to implant. You will get your period or bleeding of the increased thickness within 7 to 10 days of taking the pill. This bleeding will be thick, fleshy, dark red or brown, with slight lower abdominal pain till the bleeding is really reduced. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

I want to assure you not to worry as everything is going to be fine if proper care and treatment is opted in for. I have thoroughly gone through your case and can well understand your genuine health concerns. 1. No, there is not much problem right now as he vomited and also had a lot of water. It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases. Because, it is a volatile compound and causes vapors entering the lungs through the airways. 3. As it was only two drops, I do not think it may cause much trouble. If he feels short of breath contact me back, otherwise fine. 1. He should avoid re-exposure. 2.

For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations. If the size and number of cysts are more, then I suggest consulting a gynecologist as you may require surgery. If the number and size of cysts are less, you may continue treatment along with syrup Evecare 10 ml BD and Kanchnar Guggulu two BD.

She had taken my blood sample and it was negative. But, still I have not gotten my periods and it has been a week ahead. What could be the reason for my late periods?","Doctor":"Hello. As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses.

On day 4, I took neem leaves, on day 50, I took Acyclovir tablet, and on day 56, I did a PCR HIV test, which was negative. On day 90, I did an HIV antibody test. It was also negative. After six months, I did a fourth generation ELISA test. It was negative. After eight months, I did a western blot test. It was also negative. After 14 months, again I did the fourth generation ELISA test. It was also negative again. Even after seeing many negative results, still, I am afraid of HIV. Still, few people say, it will take more than one year to respond. Whether the neem leaves or acyclovir will affect my test results? How to stop my fear?","Doctor":"Hi. There is no role for Acyclovir. There is no need for doing any others tests as a fourth generation test is 99.9 % correct. Though all the tests are negative, still your fear is there. There is no problem except your fear, stress, anxiety, and depression. You can take the tablet Relax 0.25 mg (Alprazolam) at night for seven days. Stop taking it and take again after four days.

About five days after I was supposed to be finished ovulating, I had unprotected sex and took Plan-B the day after. I got my period when expected, but it only lasted four days (usually it lasts seven). Now my next period was supposed to come but I am two days late. Is this normal?","Doctor":"Hello. Your body clock has been really timed and punctual. Sometimes, due to few reasons like stress, anxiety, hormonal imbalance, strenuous exercise, strict dieting, etc., periods can be delayed. As I mentioned, the hormones affect the periods. As for delaying periods, and induction of menses both, we use hormones only. So, it seems that your body showed some response to your emergency contraceptive pills that are actually hormones. Last month's less bleeding and this month's two days delay are not serious as you are a teenager, and still, your reproductive system is in the developing phase. Have healthy balanced nutritious diet with exercise, yoga, and walking. Try to avoid hormones intake as still your system is developing and can be disturbed. If you have been treated for any disease, try to have full treatment.

She is 24 years old, 5 feet 10 inch, and is not currently on any medication. She was previously on medication for depression and anxiety. Her behavior is very concerning and tends to center around attention seeking. Usually, it is about she being a victim, and people coming to her aid. She does seem to have a compulsive lying issue about small and major things. Manipulation of people is also a regular trait. She tries to play people off against each other and cause friction between them. Some examples of the things she has done are as follows: She came to work regularly with injuries stating that her family members had abused her. This was her self-harming and no abuse had taken place. This went on for about six months until she got found. During this time, she would e-mail the HR manager at work pretending to be a protection officer, advising work on how to protect her. In reality, this was her sending the emails from a different e-mail account. She also created legal documents. These papers were all fake and she had sat at home, for hours on end, creating them. Other things she has done include, letting down her own car tyres and ringing someone to come and help her, pulling her door off the hinges and ringing someone to help her fix it, having surgery when there was nothing wrong with her, pretending to be on holiday and sending people photos of landmarks, potential prostitution through escort service, trapping her partner into pregnancy by not taking the pill. This is to name but a few. I am just after some thoughts as to whether this sounds like there should be a diagnosis. The NHS has seen her twice, by a junior psychiatrist, and have not given her a diagnosis. Surely the behavior above needs some kind of diagnosis, as it is far from normal. There are no childhood factors that would have caused this behaviour.","Doctor":"Hello. Hope this solves your query.

It seems like you have some vaginal infection or lack of lubrication or foreplay which is causing the problem. Proper foreplay and adequate lubrication will help you get relief from the pain. However, if you have a doubt then get yourself checked by a gynecologist and get a vaginal swab test done. Avoid having sex till then. Wear cotton panties and loose lowers.

I do not have any photosensitivity or joint pain. My skin is pretty oily and I have acne in my face. Please let me know your suggestion.","Doctor":"Hi. I assure you not to worry as everything is going to be fine if proper care and treatment is opted in for. I have thoroughly gone through your case and can well understand your genuine health concerns. The scrotal issues are due to the dryness of the skin and skin hair follicle infection. There is hyperkeratosis on the scrotal skin. All of these issues develop due to unhygienic urogenital habit and unhygienic skin condition of the areas of the external genitalia. No need to worry as I am suggesting very effective remedies for you to get better in a short period. The mouth sores  are due to throat infection and it looks like a mixture of bacterial and viral infection. So, you need to start the treatment immediately. For genital skin issues:- 1. The most important medical remedy for you is to shave the area completely including scrotum, pubic area, and the groins with a blade. Make it a habit to do undershave (armpits and the genital area) before the hair grow very tiny. 2. Keep the area clean and dry and apply Hydrozole (combination of Hydrocortisone and Clotrimazole) cream on the whole of the genital area including scrotum. 3. You should take a prescription for Amoxicillin. Keep taking Paracetamol every 8 hourly until you no more have fever. 4. Apply some gel like Orajel (Benzocaine) on the mouth ulcers and stay for 5 minutes. Then rinse with tap water. 5. Do gargles with Scope mouthwash. Take plenty of water and proper rest.

Your bilirubin level looks fine. Not so worrisome and does not require any acute measure. Regarding the loose stools, it will take time to settle. Meanwhile, you have to be very cautious to avoid dehydration and electrolyte disturbances from loose stools. Keep yourself well hydrated. Every bout of motion should make you drink water thrice the volume of stool loss or roughly 500 ml. You can have ORS packets which are the best supplements. Add probiotic capsules (like Darolac, Vizylac or Econorm) twice daily for a week. Add some acid-suppressing tablets like Pantoprazole 40 mg tablets once daily for one week. The Probinex capsule (Ibuprofen) can be avoided. Buscopan (Butylscopolamine) or Hyocimax (Hyoscine) tablets can be used twice daily for cramps.

It would be better if you could send me your detailed gynecology, obstetrics, medical, and drug history.  Have healthy habits like daily exercise, walk, yoga and a healthy nutritious diet with less salt, sugar, oil and spice.

Warm water bath, swimming, yoga, physiotherapy, a walk can help many local symptoms. Try to have normal BMI and weight by exercise. For heavy periods check for its regularity as well. If irregular periods with weight gain, abnormal hair growth, and weight gain, you need a transvaginal scan and on the second day of periods, blood sex hormones investigations. For heavy periods, you can have tablet Postan 500 mg eight hourly and tablet Tranexamic acid 500 mg eight hourly for 3 to 5 days from day two of periods.

How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations.

If I stop using this cream, I develop itching and red rashes within a period of four to five days. I consulted a dermatologist regarding this issue and he suggested me to use Miczo F cream for two weeks and then stop. But I have the same trouble after discontinuing the cream. Will you please help me to withdraw the cream safely?","Doctor":"Hello. I have noted your concern and I have viewed the images (attachment removed to protect patient identity).  I can see some dryness, flakiness, and small red patches on the side of the chin, jaw, and side of upper lip. It is not exactly a fungal infection. It is actually seborrheic dermatitis of the face. It is a condition similar to dandruff on the scalp. Seborrheic dermatitis too has a fungal etiology. The overgrowth of yeast Malassezia furfur is supposed to play a role in seborrheic dermatitis of scalp and face. The creams you have been using contain an antifungal and steroid component. Though the steroid component brings rapid control in seborrheic dermatitis but as soon as the cream is stopped the rash comes back, as in your case. I suggest you try a non-steroid cream like Pimecrolimus 1 % cream (Picon cream or Elidel cream), twice daily. You may use it for three to four weeks and then taper it off gradually. You may or may not get it to recur when you stop the cream but Pimecrolimus is at least much safer than steroid creams even if they have to be used long term. Regards.

For several years now, I have had trouble with smiling fully in certain situations. Generally, in social situations, it is almost like I give an awkward half-smile. It is hard for me to smile fully. This does not really occur when I am alone, only when I am in a social setting around people. Needless to say, I also suffer from OCD, which seems to have gotten worse over the years. But it really just involves me checking things several times. The smile issue is affecting my life way more. However, I want to know if it is more of a physical thing or a mental thing. What leads me to believe it is physical, is that I have tried exercises like smile practice, in which I hold a smile in the mirror for about five minutes. About three minutes in of holding the smile, I feel a tightness in the cheeks area, and then right after that my smile feels normal, almost as if I have released tension in a muscle or something. This does work, but constantly having to do this multiple times a week is super annoying. This led me to look into Botox, specifically the DAO procedure, which essentially freezes up the depressor angularis oris muscle in the face, which prevents frowning, and allows people to smile a lot easier. I went to two local cosmetic surgeons, but they said they were not too familiar with this procedure, and that they felt that it might work or might not, but did not feel comfortable doing it. This problem is really ruining my life and has been for years. Being able to only give a half smile in social situations is embarrassing and something that everyone notices. This often leads me to take MDMA in social situations, which makes me really happy, and not care about my smile. However, I know that I ca not keep doing this. It is not a sustainable way to cope with this issue. I wanted to get your thoughts on my situation. Thanks.","Doctor":"Hi.

Normal TSH (thyroid stimulating hormone) level is 0.5-5 mIU/L. Your high TSH level confirms that it is a thyroid swelling.

But, there is nothing to be worried. You need to take thyroid supplement daily. I advise you to take tablet Thyronorm 50 mcg every morning on empty stomach.  You may require medicines lifelong but otherwise, your life will be pretty much normal. Avoid cabbage, cauliflower, and spinach. Also, repeat the TSH test after six weeks."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I have hypothyroidism and my current TSH is 13.3. I am regularly taking Thyronorm 50 mcg one tablet daily morning before food. Kindly let me know what should be the dose to control the level now. My cholesterol levels are a bit high too.","Doctor":"Hello. I just read your query and from what you have mentioned it appears that you have hypothyroidism and dyslipidemia. I suggest that you take tablet Thyronorm (Thyroxine sodium) 75 mcg once daily. Repeat your thyroid function test after three months and then we will review again. Take tablet Simvastatin 20 mg at bedtime for high cholesterol. Repeat your lipid profile after six months. Take a low-fat diet. Drink eight to ten glasses of water in view of high uric acid. Take a low protein diet for the same.

Our family friend suggested me to consume Kalarchikai medicine, powdered mixed with pepper and honey to have it for one mandalam (48 days). I have completed nearly 44 days by consuming one small ball of the mixture every morning and before two weeks I got my periods. Then I had checked whether the cysts were dissolved by having an abdomen scan. But still, small multiple follicules have been seen in it with both ovaries enlarged. Kindly suggest me what I can do further. I got married before one and a half years and I am much worried about my pregnancy. I have gallstones as well.","Doctor":"Hello. I just read your query. See Kalarachi Kai choornam is helpful in amenorrhea. As far as small cysts are concerned they are unmatured eggs which failed to induce menstrual cycle previously, as a result, they got collected in the ovary and they will remain in the ovary. Now, you have got your periods you can start trying for conception. But I advise you to do it under the supervision of a nearby gynecologist because egg size is important while conception and that you can know by ovulation study. Ovulation study is performed under the supervision of a gynecologist. For gall stones, surgical intervention is required generally. Medicine is not of much help."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I was told that my gums are fine with most of them at level 3 and a few in level 4.

The symptoms were visible eight years back itself, but we felt it is quite common and the days passed on, and the symptoms became more prominent. My father's elder sister also had HD chorea, and she passed away due to depression. We started consulting doctor seven years back. From Ayurvedic to scientific, we have tried in all ways, but the doctors say that there is no proper treatment for this disorder. He is continuously on medication, but it is of no use. He is becoming weak day by day though we are giving him health supplements like Herba Life to make him strong and strengthen his body. Please help me to recover him. Currently, he is on Petril, Amentral, Evion, Parkin, and blood pressure tablets. The laboratory tests performed were blood test, urine test, MRI, and CT.","Doctor":"Hello.  I understand your concern, but unfortunately this is a progressive neurological disorder and there is no cure. It is genetic and it can be inherited in the patient's children. For this reason, I would recommend you and your brothers or sisters, cousins to perform the genetic analysis for this disease. The main therapy for this disorder is antipsychotics (Haloperidol, Clonazepam, etc.) which help reduce the amplitude of the movements and help the patient improve his situation. But the progression of the disease can not be stopped, and it can not be cured. If you have not tried it yet, I would suggest treatment with Tetrabenazine. Consult with your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and take medications with their consent. Psychological support is important too. I recommend consulting with a psychiatrist.

Today whenever I am going to the washroom to urinate, it is burning and somewhat paining. Please suggest what to do and what can be the reason behind it?","Doctor":"Hello. The symptoms sound like some vaginal infection. Vaginal infection is transmitted during sex (so partner is the source) so both have to be treated at a time or else you will get infected the next time of sex. You may have white or yellow or grayish discharge with or without itching, foul smell, pain at beginning of sex due to dryness (as the lubrication will be reduced) late towards the end when fully erect penis touches the innermost vagina due to inflammation of the structures around the uterus with pain radiating to the back and thighs. Associated with infection, the bowel movement is also affected. There are also features of gastritis. Bleeding of periods will be thicker, darker, clots and fleshy masses like, may smell bad, more days with spotting after the periods too. When you have an infection inside the uterus, the blood flow increases as the inner lining is inflamed and the blood mixed with the inner lining of uterus form a thick, doughy or fleshy mass. As the healing of the lining is not complete, it keeps spotting or you have blood stained discharge. Pain is throbbing even before periods and it lasts after periods are over too. Usually, the infection is mixed and not just due to yeast fungus. There will be a family of aerobic and anaerobic bacteria, all of which cannot be detected on culture. When one is treated and cleared, other will grow and if not fully treated, it will regrow. Before starting the treatment, confirm that you are not pregnant. I suggest you and your partner have the following: Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and with their consent take the medicines mentioned below. All these on the same day by both of you. I suggest you can also have capsule Doxycycline 100 mg twice a day for one week, vaginal wash with VWash (Lactic Acid Formulation) or similar cleanser twice a day and a vaginal pessary. Also, capsule Clingen Forte (Clindamycin, Clotrimazole, and Tinidazole) or Candid-CL (Clindamycin Topical and Clotrimazole Topical) or Cansoft-CL (Clindamycin and Clotrimazole) once at night for five nights.  Your partner can have a local application of an antibiotic and antifungal cream Candid-B (Beclometasone Topical and Clotrimazole Topical) or Candiderma cream (Beclometasone Topical, Clotrimazole Topical, Neomycin Topical) or Lobate GM (Clobetasol Topical, Miconazole Topical, and Neomycin Topical) on the penis twice a day after wash for seven days.

How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves.

Dengue hemorrhagic fever.  In both the cases we have to keep the treatment strategy in different ways. There is no definite cure for the disease and it is self-limiting. People usually get better in a few weeks. 1. Take plenty of fluids and water to replenish electrolytes and keep you hydrated. 2. Take fever reducing agents like Tylenol (Acetaminophen) but no Aspirin. 3. Take complete bed rest. 4. Keep an eye on your body and body openings. If there are any signs of petechiae, blue spots, bleeding from orifices, stool color darker brownish black or red, urine color change or anything that may give a suspicion of bleeding, call the emergency service right away.

She is a 27 year old European woman. She had in total three episodes of catatonia that required hospitalization. But I suspect it may have been depression instead, since she volunteered hospitalization. She has been given Solian (amisulpride) from 2011 to 2013 and then in 2014. Then she had problems of too high prolactin and they changed it to Abilify (aripiprazole). She also gained a lot of fat (about 40kg in 5 years) and seems to keep getting slowly bigger, since she is often hungry, probably as a side effect of the medicines. She is not taking other medications and she is otherwise healthy. She declared that she is not afraid any more, after switching from Solian to Abilify, but she feels unhappy. She appears much less talkative and lively than she used to be years ago. She is less confident too. I suspect that she may have depression rather than schizophrenia and I noticed that she has significant anxiety, victim mentality (quite important) and some sleeping problems. She is insecure and she dropped out of several educations in the last couple of years. She has abusive parents and she went back living with them. She has recently received cognitive therapy but she felt insulted and not helped. She and I wish to find a solution for her. Thank you.","Doctor":"Hello. I can understand your concern. I have read the query and after reading the history of hers I can tell you that these symptoms suggest more towards some neurotic illness specifically depression rather than catatonic schizophrenia. In catatonic schizophrenia patients show symptoms like negativism, echolalia (automatic repetition of words spoken by other persons), echopraxia (involuntary or automatic repetition of the movements of other persons), waxy flexibility etc. She has developed illness in episodes and not continuously, which also points more towards depression because psychotic illnesses run a continuous course. Her symptoms like lack of confidence, anxiety, poor sleep, feelings of insecurity, feeling of unhappiness, less talkative etc., suggest depression. There is no history of any suspiciousness, no history suggestive of hallucinations which weakens diagnosis of a psychotic disorder. So, in my opinion from available history her diagnosis is more likely to be depression rather than catatonic schizophrenia. Even in severe depression individuals may present with depressive stupor which can mimic a catatonia. Please visit her doctor again and ask for reevaluation of diagnosis. She responded to amisulpride (drug used both in psychosis and depression) but later developed side effects. Aripiprazole can help in psychosis but in depression its use is limited. In my opinion there is need to add some good antidepressant. Drugs like Sertraline can prove useful for her symptoms. Please discuss with her psychiatrist for these medicines. Do not be distressed, provide her good loving support and she should improve from her symptoms. Hope this helps you.

She had taken my blood sample and it was negative. But, still I have not gotten my periods and it has been a week ahead. What could be the reason for my late periods?","Doctor":"Hello. As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses.

The hair loss is at least double than normal, in the 200 range, and it falls extremely easy from her head. It is not patchy and I can find no bald spots, her scalp looks healthy. So far, the loss is not noticeable. Her iron, thyroid, and blood count, are normal. The week before this started we were on vacation. She spent the week in the sun and pool. Her scalp did receive a minor burn that peeled, but it healed quickly. Three months ago, she used a lice shampoo. Nothing else in her history explains this. She does have minor eczema and seasonal allergies. Any idea what is going on and when it will stop?","Doctor":"Hi.

The symptoms went away six months back but returned a month back (burning, tingling, etc). I suffer from high blood pressure and anxiety. The neurologists could not find the cause after all tests. I tested negative for HIV but tested positive for herpes 1 and 2. Can herpes cause this? It has been so long since I had these symptoms.","Doctor":"Hello. It is less likely that your symptoms are related to herpes. Herpes infection does not usually lead to such a clinical situation. Besides, a positive test does not always indicate an active infection. The fact that your tests resulted in positive means that you have gone through this infection in the past. In fact, herpes 1 is a very common infection (almost everyone has gone through it). So, I do not think that your symptoms are related to these types of infections. In many cases, no cause of peripheral neuropathy is found (idiopathic peripheral neuropathy). Regarding the pain and burning sensation, I would recommend starting treatment with Pregabalin or Gabapentin. Another possible treatment option would be Duloxetine. I would also advise you to be active. Physical therapy can help improve your clinical situation. You should discuss with your doctor about the above treatment options.

She has been advised surgical excision. Is it safe? Are there any complications? Will her hair grow back?","Doctor":"Hello. Sebaceous cyst on the scalp is very common.There are no complications in relation to the surgical excision. Regarding the hair growth, yes it does grow back because hair follicles are not damaged. Only the operative site will be shaved. Some plastic surgeons with loads of practice operate with very minimal hair shaving. So, do not worry. Her hair will grow back. Only when the stitches are taken off, there are chances of very minimal pain. Even this can be overcome by using a topical anesthetic gel/spray during suture removal.

My eyes were yellow, ALT level was 226, Hepatitis E result was 9.4 u/ml. I went to a gastroenterologist for checking and he prescribed me few medicines Siliver, Sulvorid, Dexxoo. In the follow up he prescribed me Ipride. After taking that medicine I am having loose motion and feeling cold now.","Doctor":"Hello. From your symptoms and your test reports (attachment removed to protect patient identity), it looks like you have viral hepatitis, particularly hepatitis E. Viral hepatitis affects your liver cells and causes their inflammation which can lead to dysfunction in the normal functioning of the liver. The disease can vary from being self-limiting to highly fulminant. Hepatitis E has been known to lead to fulminant hepatitis which has quite a high mortality. The course of infection has two phases, the prodromal phase, and the icteric phase. Prodromal-phase symptoms include myalgia, arthralgia, fever, anorexia, nausea, vomiting, weight loss, dehydration, and right upper quadrant pain. Icteric-phase symptoms may last days to several weeks and include jaundice (yellowish discoloration of skin and eyes), dark urine, light-colored stools, itching (pruritus). I would request to see a doctor and get admitted as soon as possible for further evaluation. Your liver enzymes have to be monitored regularly along with pt/INR (prothrombin time) report to see whether liver is synthesizing the clotting enzymes well. Now coming to the treatment. Acute hepatitis E in immunocompetent persons usually only requires symptomatic treatment, as almost all of them are able to clear the virus spontaneously. The acute illness may result in anorexia, nausea, and vomiting, predisposing patients to dehydration. These symptoms tend to be worse in the afternoon or evening. Patients should attempt to ingest significant calories in the morning. As they improve, frequent small meals may be better tolerated. Hospitalization should be considered for patients with dehydration. Ribavirin an antiviral drug is reserved for people who worsen. You can continue taking Dexxoo (Dexlansoprazole). Stop Ipride (Itopride Hcl) if it causes loose stools. Eat light food and drink plenty of fluids. Take tablet Paracetamol 500 for fever. Consult a doctor immediately if you think your condition is worsening. I hope this helps."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I have a gap between my two front teeth.

The doctor told me that now my kidney is affected. I am not taking medicines to control diabetes for seven years. Only by diet and walk, I have been controlling my sugar. Is the damage to my kidneys too bad or can it be cured? Is it in the initial stage or already heavily damaged? I am taking five to six bitter gourd juice every day. Will this harm my kidney?","Doctor":"Hello. I understand your concern. It is very important not to worry, and to take the correct steps towards achieving better health with diabetes. Since your glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) is 9.6, your sugar level has definitely not been under control for a long time now. So, your methods of exercise and diet did not seem to really help your condition. For an HbA1c level of 9.6, it is practically not possible to control blood sugar levels by diet and exercise alone. I am pretty sure your doctor might have conveyed the same to you. Going by your creatinine level, 69 seems unusually high. We usually do not come across such numbers. Did you mean 0.69? Also, check the unit of measurement. Is it mg/dL? Please check your reports again. There seems to be some error. Looking at microalbumin level (199), it looks like your high sugar levels have just started affecting your kidneys. It is definitely recommended to start taking anti-diabetic medicines at the earliest to avoid further complications. Bitter gourd juice is alright, you could reduce it to two to three per day. Continue your no-sugar diet and exercise. Meet your diabetologist at the earliest and start taking medication. I hope that helps.

How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases. Because, it is a volatile compound and causes vapors entering the lungs through the airways. 3. As it was only two drops, I do not think it may cause much trouble. If he feels short of breath contact me back, otherwise fine. 1. He should avoid re-exposure. 2.

But, this is the corrected one, previously it was much lower. In delivery, there is a chance of bleeding, changes in clotting factors and hormonal changes at delivery which can cause more bleeding, difficult or complicated delivery or labor also need normal hemoglobin level. It depends on different doctors how they treat the patient according to her history, blood reports, sensitivity to iron, etc. If she remains comfortable with Venofer and does not get sensitivity, vomitings or any other side effects, then it is better to have that as there is less chances of immune reaction as that of blood from another person.

The first time I went to the cardiologist, he totally dismissed it as muscular pain due to bad posture and mild bronchitis. I had an episode of sinus tachycardia last year following which I visited the same cardiologist. He did my ECG, 2D echo, troponin, CP-MB and stress test. All tests were normal (Troponin was 1.5 ng/L and CP-MB was 14). I was however referred to a senior cardiologist for further assurance. He did not feel the need to investigate any further but put me on Nebicard SM 5 mg (now reduced to 2.5 mg/day). He attributed the problem to anxiety and described the chest pain as non-specific.Mid last year, I was diagnosed with grade II GERD. The gastroenterologist who did my endoscopy said the chest pain is entirely because of GERD and it is not cardiac. I experienced major chest discomfort two months ago. The doctor repeated my ECG, troponin and CP-MB. Troponin was unchanged at 1.5ng/L and CP-MB was 5.Despite all these investigations seeming to rule out a cardiac problem, my symptoms are extremely discomforting, and sometimes seem to resemble cardiac pain. I have to explain the symptoms in detail so kindly bear with me.The chest pain mostly starts in the upper breastbone (left side or right side of the chest), then it radiates downwards and towards the side of the chest (below underarms). Sometimes it radiates to my left or right arm (not both arms at a time) and back. I have a stiff neck as well. When I press my neck on the sides, the pain radiates like a shock wave through my arm and breastbone. Chest pain lasts for minutes to hours. There are times when I do not feel any pain even after walking three to four kilometres and there are times when walking a few meters or climbing a few stairs worsens pain. Sometimes the pain goes away with rest sometimes it does not.Sometimes it is stabbing pain, other times it is dull in nature. Many times the pain is triggered by eating. I recently checked my thyroid profile. TSH was low at 0.24 but T3 and T4 were within normal range. I have been experiencing clammy palms and increased sweating in underarms. I have lost 5 kg in the last three months. There is increased fatigue, brain fog, confusion, stress. I am really confused about my symptoms. Need help. Thanks.","Doctor":"Hello. I have gone through your history and reports (attachment removed to protect patient identity). You have not uploaded the report of stress test here but you mentioned that it is done. So anyway, firstly I do not think this has any relation to the heart because your age is less, symptoms are not compatible with heart disease and also all your evaluation is also negative. So, I think you should not worry regarding a cardiac cause. Just for the sake of completion of evaluation (not absolutely necessary), you can get stress test (treadmill test or stress thallium) done if not done already. The possibilities in you are certainly you have reflux disease and hiatus hernia and it is leading to pain. This is a very common mimicker of cardiac disease. In addition to reflux, another contributing factor could be cervical spine problem as you mentioned some of the symptoms. So, these two causes in combination giving you trouble. You are already taking treatment for reflux. For cervical pain, which occurs due to compression of nerves between spine, you should get X-ray cervical spine AP/Lat view and further may need MRI. You need to visit physiotherapist after X-ray and also an orthopedician. Meanwhile, I suggest tablet Neurobion forte once a day which is a nerve vitamin. If this is not helpful then you need to request your doctor for tablet Pregabalin 75 mg bedtime, which is a nerve stabilizer, relieves pain and tablet Myoril 4 mg two to three times a day whenever for neck stiffness. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines with their consent. Hope this helps you and get back if you have any doubts.

So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

He vomited and had lot of salt water. Please advice for any side effect.","Doctor":"Hi. I want to assure you not to worry as everything is going to be fine if proper care and treatment is opted in for. I have thoroughly gone through your case and can well understand your genuine health concerns. 1. No, there is not much problem right now as he vomited and also had a lot of water. It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases. Because, it is a volatile compound and causes vapors entering the lungs through the airways. 3. As it was only two drops, I do not think it may cause much trouble. If he feels short of breath contact me back, otherwise fine. 1. He should avoid re-exposure. 2. Rule out if there is some sort of suicidal ideation due to depression or anxiety and take him to a psychiatrist for physical evaluation.

I used it for 30 days continuously, but no use. How many days should I take that powder and how to overcome this problem?","Doctor":"Hello. For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations. If the size and number of cysts are more, then I suggest consulting a gynecologist as you may require surgery. If the number and size of cysts are less, you may continue treatment along with syrup Evecare 10 ml BD and Kanchnar Guggulu two BD.

She had taken my blood sample and it was negative. But, still I have not gotten my periods and it has been a week ahead. What could be the reason for my late periods?","Doctor":"Hello. As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses.

My CBC, abdominal ultrasound and FOBT were all normal. I was put on one-month medication consisting of Rifagut 550 (twice per day), Colospa Retard (twice per day) and Librax. My only problem was aggressive BM, not diarrhea but a lot of gas after getting up in morning followed by first BM and then another BM in a span of two hours. I weighed 79 kg seven months back and did drop to 72 kg weighed last month. The doctor says this weight loss is clinically not scary. I did consult another doctor who says this to be gut flora imbalance and not IBS as I have not had any relief from IBS medication and he believes my symptoms does not correlate with typical IBS. At present, I have a frequent passing of gas, especially after eating food or dinner. In the morning BM is smooth however I do feel the gas and pressure again in three hours time and this trend is regular. The stomach gets settled after second BM. I do hear stomach growling and if I press my stomach hard I do feel pain like tenderness but only if I press hard otherwise there is not any pain, cramp or anything. I was advised to take Nexium 40 mg empty stomach for three weeks and I am still continuing with my third week. I was asked to quit smoking, alcohol and all non-vegetarian items which I have done from past one week. I am also taking one capsule of 64 billion probiotic daily along with 100 ml Kefir. My breakfast includes probiotic yogurt along with oats. I also have suspected migraine or occipital neuralgia owing to which I have had a lot of Voltaren 50 mg tablets at least 10 to 15 days in a month from past four years.I really want to understand what is this gas, morning episode BM and stomach growling all about? And how can I get rid of this once for all if it is an issue? Is this gut flora imbalance or IBS? How can I live an effective and healthy life?","Doctor":"Hi. Going through your history and reports, I do not feel anything so scary with you. Your reports are absolutely fine. It is very difficult to say whether you have IBS (irritable bowel syndrome) or gut flora imbalance. The diagnosis of IBS is reached when we exclude all other possible common problems, which was done in your case too. Now the basic issues need to be addressed. This includes gut microbe modification too. So have your probiotics for a month. Maintain the modified diet for long periods. Avoid excess gas forming foodstuffs. Have two to three liters of water daily. Limit your Voltaren (Diclofenac) use. Colospa Regard (Mebeverine) can be used if you have severe symptoms. Make a habit to spend some time in the toilet rather than rushing after the first BM (bowel movement). The initial BM is the already collected ones in the rectal pouch and the later one is all which comes slowly from above. So it may not be pathologic. Reflux BM can also happen in some after having food which is called exaggerated gastrocolic reflux. All these are normal variants. Avoid excess stress in life if you have any. Avoid over attention to this problem too. These also will definitely help. If even after 2 to 3 months you are not getting a response, further evaluation includes a contrast CT scan of abdomen and colonoscopy, which you need not think of now.

The pain goes to the back and side especially when I sleep on the side. Sometimes the discomfort is in the middle right and lower abdomen.

I have gained 3 kg within four months. I also get frequent leg pain and weakness especially in the morning when I wake up. I had vitamin B12 deficiency and have taken 15 injections before three months. I have a lot of gastric issues with this as well. I am uploading my CT images. Please help.","Doctor":"Hi. I have seen the attachment. (attachment removed to protect patient identity).  The CT abdomen scan is showing mild fatty changes in the liver and a left inguinal hernia. The ultrasound scan abdomen is showing fatty changes in the liver. The upper gastrointestinal endoscopy report is showing a small hiatus hernia. The blood test is showing upper limit of normal SGPT (serum glutamic pyruvate transaminase) and SGOT (serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase). The contrast CT scan images of the abdomen are viewed. The fatty changes in the liver are not significant. Such fatty changes are visualized in many people. However, if you are having a high-fat diet or alcohol regularly then you need to discuss with your doctors and take precautions. The hiatus hernia is a small herniation of the stomach above the diaphragm. This causes discomfort on bending down. Please avoid bending frequently, avoid lying down for two to three hours after a meal. Avoid smoking. Take meals in small amounts, if you feel discomfort when eating too much. For the left inguinal hernia, you need to consult a surgeon and take an opinion. It might need surgery and repair. Coming to the pain, it is possible that the hernia can cause pain in the lower abdomen. At the same time, other causes of weakness need to be discussed. It will help to know if you got a complete blood test done (other than given liver tests and vitamin B12 test) and if there are other areas that need attention."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I got my breast implants (saline) removed two years ago.

How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it?

I had a normal eye and heart tests, which were also reassuring, I have moderately high blood pressure. The doctor told me to get a brain CT scan, and the reports came back normal. However, the description notes read, hypodensities bilaterally under the putamen, which aspects indicate Virchow-Robin spaces. I had a previous CT scan five years ago, which did not find this. How is the conclusion note in the report normal? I read on the internet that these spaces can actually be ischemic lacunes and symptom of an ischemic attack. Does this warrant an MRI scan? Thank you in advance.","Doctor":"Hello.

It is just to the left of my nose. My face is not drooping nor is my mouth. I do not see any red or white spots and there is no pain. It just feels weird. It started about a week or so ago. I do not smoke.","Doctor":"Hello Your description of your symptoms sounds a bit strange to me but if your lip moves involuntarily, then you may have muscle twitching due to too much caffeine if you drink a lot of coffee, but there are also other less common causes. If you have tingling, this could be an early sign of recurrent herpes infection though it lasts only a few days before the vesicles start to appear and one week is a long time. There may also be a spasm in your lip muscles so try hot pads on your lip for starters to relax the muscle and if you take a lot of caffeine, reduce your consumption and eat foods rich in potassium like banana. If you start to feel tingling or see any redness in that area you may need to consult a doctor (an oral medicine specialist or dermatologist) for an antiviral prescription. There are other rare possibilities that may be the reason behind your symptoms but as they are uncommon I would not worry about them at the moment. Having said that, I suggest seeking further medical attention if you don't improve after a few days."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor,I am trying to conceive but my husband and I did cocaine a week ago. How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations. If the size and number of cysts are more, then I suggest consulting a gynecologist as you may require surgery.

As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses.

I have cheesy discharges, itching, burning, and it is very uncomfortable. Please suggest some medicines.","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Vaginal infection, which is transmitted during sex (so partner is the source), so both have to be treated at the same time or else you will get infected again during sex. You may have white or yellow or grayish discharge with or without itching, foul smell, pain at the beginning of sex due to dryness (as the lubrication will be reduced) and late towards the end, when fully erect penis touches the inner most vagina (due to inflammation of the structures around the uterus). The pain will be radiating to the back or thighs. Your bowel movement will be affected and also features of gastritis are seen. Bleeding of periods will be thicker, darker, clots or fleshy masses may smell bad, more days with spotting after the periods too. When you have an infection inside the uterus, the blood flow increases as inner lining is inflamed and the blood mixed with the inner lining of the uterus forms a thick, doughy or fleshy mass. As the healing of the lining is not complete, it keeps spotting, or you have blood stained discharge. The pain is throbbing even before periods and lasts after periods are over. Usually, the infection is mixed and not just due to yeast. There will be a family of aerobic and anaerobic bacteria, all of which cannot be detected by culture. When one is treated and cleared, the other will grow. Before treatment, confirm that you are not pregnant. I suggest you and your partner try taking the following: After this, I suggest you try taking the following: Your partner can locally apply any antibiotic and antifungal cream, like Candid B (Clotrimazole and Betamethasone) on the penis twice a day after wash for seven days. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. Do not have sex till the infection is fully gone. Do treat it as delay may send the infection inwards and may affect both you and partner's future fertility. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

Also, my aldosterone level is very low that is almost non-existent. I think low aldosterone is supposed to cause low blood pressure. I am wondering once I start the low aldosterone treatment will my blood pressure, potassium and vitamin D level go back to normal? Please reply.","Doctor":"Hi, Welcome back to icliniq.com. You are right. Hyperaldosteronism causes hypertension with low potassium. But, in your case the things are opposite. That means the high BP is not related to aldosterone levels. You might be having an entity called essential hypertension. Low vitamin D levels are present in 60% of the population, so do not relate it with BP. Just have a good sunbath for at least twice a week and have vitamin D3 supplements 60000 IU once a week orally. For treatment of hypertension, I suggest ACE inhibitor therapy such as Telmisartan or Olmesartan. This will correct your BP and potassium levels.

So, this is suggestive of postural hypotension, meaning when you suddenly get blood supply to brain goes down and you get symptoms till body adjusts it. This is most of the time benign and not worrisome and goes away with lifestyle changes. However, we should rule out the autonomic neuropathy. You should get your BP checked by the local doctor or yourself if having BP apparatus at home. For that, you have to check BP while lying down and then recheck it after you stand whenever you started feeling dizzy, and see the difference between the two readings. You should get your thyroid, sugar levels done if not done recently. Next if you are consuming too much alcohol then needs to reduce the consumption. Please let me the know the content of the first medicine you mentioned and if you are taking any other medicines. Is there any response to Vertin (Betahistine)?

According to the dates you have mentioned (attachment removed to protect patient identity), you have conceived during the last week of the month, as it was the fertile period for you. And, you are almost 6 plus weeks pregnant now. Please get a scan for an early pregnancy to ensure your date and fetal cardiac activity. Also, get started with Folic acid supplements with consent. Avoid having sex, lifting heavy weights and stressful exercises. Regarding food to be avoided are pineapple and papaya. Rest all vegetables and fruits you can have. Take plenty of fluids, vegetables, fruits, iron-rich foods, milk and milk products. Have a regular follow-up with your gynecologist.

Sometimes it is clear and sometimes it is green with red specks in which I assume is blood. I have a pressure on my chest so breathing can be hard.","Doctor":"Hello. I have read through your query and went through the attachment you sent (attachment removed to protect patient identity). Sometimes violent coughing can lead to specks of blood in sputum. You said that you have chest congestion and greenish sputum. That means you are suffering from upper respiratory tract infection. You need to take an antibiotic course. But if there is a recurrence of blood tinged sputum you will need to get yourself assessed.  CT chest should be done along with a sputum examination. Another factor to be taken into consideration is whether you smoke.  I hope I was able to help. If you have any further questions please feel free to write.

After eating I feel a sudden pain in my upper abdomen or more specifically in the epigastric region. Last week I'm surprised that even though I don't have any problem digesting milk or dairy products I got suddenly become lactose intolerant after drinking an sterilized milk. I thought first it's just a common digestive problem so I take loperamide however after a few minutes I suddenly feel the symptoms of a heartburn so I take kremil S. Is there's a home remedy that can lessen the pain!","Doctor":"Hello,, I am a family physician with Icliniq and would be glad to try and answer your question. Thanks for all the information you gave about your question. Whenever you share with us a problem, it is always helpful to the doctor when you give information like when the problem started, it's location and severity, other accompanying symptoms like diarrhea, vomiting, fever... if you have had it before, and what response there has been to treatment. Also it is important to know if a doctor has seen you for this problem in the past,, whether you smoke or drink, and whether or not you have other medical problems for which you regularly take medicine. There can be many reasons for upper abdominal /chest pain in your age group. I will list them for you as well as the most common treatments. If none of these help you, you would need to contact us again with more information. Gastritis/ulcer disease can cause severe pain and sometimes bleeding in the upper abdomen. You might have dark stools, feel dizzy from loss of blood or have lots of soreness to touch in your belly. Often patients do better when they stop taking any pain medicines like aspirin or ibuprofen which can irritate the stomach and use a proton pump inhibitor like omeprazole 20 mg 30 minutes before breakfast every day for 2 weeks. Some people use a 1/2 teaspoon of baking soda in a 120 ml glass of warm water, which can help but isn't used regularly Another problem is acid reflux. It is very similar to gastritis, but usually causes heartburn as the acid goes up into the esophagus in the chest. It also responds well to omeprazole. Abdominal pain can come from stress which irritates the large intestine. Loperamide often will help that pain, usually 2-4 mg at a time when you feel the paint, up to 4 times a day. A stomach and intestinal infection can cause pain. It is usually accompanied by diarrhea and sometimes fever. Most stomach infections respond to loperamide and increasing your fluids. Gallbladder disease (stones) can cause intense pain, especially after meals that are fatty. This problem is best diagnosed by having an ultrasound done and seeing a surgeon. Pancreatitis is an inflammation of the pancreas which is often caused by drinking alcohol. There is often very severe pain and vomiting. Patients can get better by stopping any alcohol and not eating for 1-2 days. Often they need to see the doctor. Lastly, COVID-19, the virus which is causing the pandemic worldwide, can cause diarrhea, fever and cough. It is always wise to think about whether or not you have had contact with a patient who was diagnosed with the virus, and consider getting tested. As always, any problem that is not getting better or is getting worse despite what you can do at home needs to be seen by a doctor. Hope this information is helpful to you!"},{"Patient":"Hello doctor,I am trying to conceive but my husband and I did cocaine a week ago. How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

Three months back testicle pain and difficulty reaching ejaculation for a few days. Also, a mild pain near the rectum or anus for a few days. A month later received unprotected oral sex from a woman. The very next month started to feel intense burning sensation in the penis (not when urinating, in fact, urinating relieved it). Also, intense pain located in glans to the right, between the corona and the meatus. No discharge. Took 1.0 g of Azithromycin and 1.0 g of Ciprofloxacin, just in case. Gonorrhea. chlamydia, mycoplasma, etc, and urine culture and stain grams all were negative. Two days later I had a lot of urinary urgencies. CT scan revealed inflamed bladder walls, small urine retention, and urinalysis shows WBC count of 2 to 4. I was started on Levofloxacin. Two weeks later the symptoms continued. Urine turned very thick. Urologist says it is urethritis (which I do not think so, because the burning is not when urinating, but mostly all the time) orders another CT scan and MRI. Everything comes out normal, except WBC count in urine 8 to 10. Culture and STD negative again. Two days later the doctor orders four weeks of Levofloxacin, Tamsulosin, and Solifenacin. Also, something for a fungal infection and a pill for if the penis pain was neurological. A week later another urine sample was taken. Everything was normal this time, including WBC count. STD panel negative. Three weeks later the doctor had diagnosed prostatitis and insists on continuing treatment. Symptoms persisted like frequent urination, constant intense burning in penis or bladder, painful ejaculation and a small amount of semen, thick urine, occasional testicle pain. No rash on the penis, no discharge, no lesions, no fever, no joint pain. Could this be really prostatitis? If it is, could it be bacterial from the oral sex episode?

I am also very much sensitive to touch, which feels like my entire body is bruised all over. It is so hard to explain, but that is the best way I can put it into words.

However, if the curvature is getting worse and if you want to confirm it, then you can get an ultrasound scan of the penis done to check for plaques. It might indicate a pathological disease like Peyronies disease. Please use lubrication jelly and try to retract the foreskin slowly in the flaccid state. Do not pull the foreskin forcefully. Please try to pull it back a little more every day. If there is a pain when pulling it again, then stop doing it and try it on the next day. If the complete retraction is not possible even after using lubrication jelly, then you have to consult the urologist."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I have a question regarding my urine. I feel I might have urinary tract infection, as I feel slight burning while passing the urine, and once the urine is done for a few seconds. Also, sometimes my urine is cloudy, or milky type at the beginning of the urine. Leukocyte esterase came positive, and pus cells are 8 to 10 WBC or HPF. Please check the report, and inform me same about the disease, and what to do. Is this related to sexually transmitted disease by any chance? I had unprotected sex, five months ago, and recently tested for HIV and came negative. Is this something to do with it?","Doctor":"Hi. I have gone through your query, I would like to know a few more details to answer your query better. Do you have any fever or lower abdominal pain? Have you had any slowing of your urinary stream recently? Is this your first attack of UTI or have you had one before? Your report (attachment removed to protect patient identity) suggests that you have urinary tract infection. The next step would be to give a urine culture and start you on antibiotics based on the culture. In addition, you will have to drink plenty of fluids to flush out the infected urine and bacteria. Once your UTI is treated your urine should become clear. As you mentioned any recent sexual contact can provoke a UTI, but it is not possible if it was five months ago. As you are a young male, it is very unusual to get spontaneous UTI's. This will have to be checked out after treatment with an ultrasound, residual urine estimation, and uroflowmetry."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I am 23 years old. I underwent open internal rigid sphincterotomy and hemorrhoidectomy for chronic anal fissure and piles. But I have severe pain in the anal canal all the time now. During bowel movements, it gets worse. I underwent surgery before 23 days. I also see some blood in stools. Without stool softener, I unable to bear the pain. How long does it take to get a full recovery? Please suggest.","Doctor":"Hi. Recovery time after surgery is two to three weeks. But it may take a month in some cases. You can try these simple steps to accelerate recovery. Try these steps for a week. If the problem persists, it is better to consult a surgeon and try to do a physical examination of the anal region. Try to take increased fibers in your diet. Take at least five to six servings of fruits and raw vegetables every day. Avoid taking white bread. Drink plenty of water. Use one teaspoon of mineral oil in your meals. It will help in sliding your bowel, and there will be no pain. Do not delay your bowel as it can increase the pain. Go to the toilet as soon as you have an urge to pass motions and do not strain."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am married for the past six years and stayed with my wife for around two years in these six years due to job location reasons. My wife has asked for divorce now as I am not able to insert my penis into her vagina in these six years. I have done following test up till now: Semen analysis, erectile dysfunction tests, testosterone tests also. I am not suffering from any early ejaculation also. Whenever I try to insert penis into vagina, it is bending at the face of the penis. I masturbate very easily and erection is better while during masturbation as compared to when I try to do intercourse. I am still a virgin at the age of 35. I do not know whether my erection is sufficient to insert it. Whenever I try to insert, the erection does not sustain also for a very long time. I also lost confidence whether I will be able to do intercourse in my life with anybody. Now my wife has left me so I cannot try to insert it at home. Please guide me.","Doctor":"Hi. I read your query and understand your concerns about ongoing issues with your sex life after going through all the attachments (attachment removed to protect patient identity). Although, it is never possible to comment conclusively, but from the available description, it is clear that you are suffering from erectile dysfunction. Failure to sustain an erection during intercourse and bending of the penis at the base on attempted intercourse indicates that there is a problem. However, the presence of early morning erections, normal biological reports and the ability to have successful masturbation indicates that the problem is psychogenic rather than organic. Considering these two facts I feel you should see a psychiatrist without delay since the problem is psychogenic erectile dysfunction. I understand that you have lost your confidence but I must assure you that the problem is largely treatable and there is little to worry in this era of advanced medical care. In my experience, more than 80 % of individuals with psychogenic erectile dysfunction show good results after a few sessions of psychotherapy."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am 28 years old. From the past two weeks, there is a slight pain in my right ear. I tried Clear Wax ear drops and normal ear drops then there is a relief for a certain period then again mild pain is coming the next day. When I wake up in the morning there is a very slight headache kind on the right side and some sort of discomfort in my right ear. There is not severe pain but certainly, there is some sort of mild pain. I also noticed whenever I tried using earbuds in my left ear to clean then I am getting cough as if some sort of itchiness sensation in the ear is causing immediate cough in the throat and normal again after I take earbud out. I want to know whether I should consult ENT specialist immediately or if there are any ear drops in particular to use before I go to ENT doctor.","Doctor":"Hello. The cough which occurs during ear cleaning is due to stimulus to your auricular branch of the vagus nerve, which is normal. Now coming to your problem, many times mild pain occurs due to impacted wax or ETD (eustachian tube dysfunction). Both cases it is advisable to consult an ENT surgeon for the proper examination of the ear. Till then, continue the ear drop, do Valsalva 30 to 40 times a day. Never try to clean the ear yourself as it can cause injury to your ear."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I had a complete blood count test and it seems my lymphocytes % is high. Please help me. Is this something I should be scared about? I was in my period when the blood test was taken in case this has any relation to the results.","Doctor":"Hello. Your lymphocytes percentage is slight high. Kindly mention your clinical complaints so that I can guide you further. It is not a matter of getting scared as your all other parameters are within range. I suggest you repeat CBC after week. Usually, a temporary viral infection can lead to lymphocytes elevation temporarily. It has no relation to menstruation. If after one-week lymphocytosis persist, then investigate with peripheral smear examination report for further work up."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I have a line of white and black patches in my lower gums. What could it be?","Doctor":"Hi. Your chief complaint and attachment show pigmentation which can be due to various reasons (attachment removed to protect patient identity). Physiological due to the activity of hormones MSH (melanocyte-stimulating hormone) or taking any kind of drugs like Minocycline, mouthwashes or endocrine issues or poor oral hygiene like calculus or deficiency of iron or anemia or jaundice. Your chief complaint is incomplete so it is difficult to arrive at a proper conclusion. If it is from birth, then no problem and if is a recent finding then you need to forward further history about drugs, diseases or any change in your health. Still, I suggest you go for a general oral examination and you may need scaling and root planing as well."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I am a 26 year old male.

How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

I want to assure you not to worry as everything is going to be fine if proper care and treatment is opted in for. I have thoroughly gone through your case and can well understand your genuine health concerns. 1. No, there is not much problem right now as he vomited and also had a lot of water. It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases. Because, it is a volatile compound and causes vapors entering the lungs through the airways. 3. As it was only two drops, I do not think it may cause much trouble. If he feels short of breath contact me back, otherwise fine. 1. He should avoid re-exposure. 2.

For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations. If the size and number of cysts are more, then I suggest consulting a gynecologist as you may require surgery. If the number and size of cysts are less, you may continue treatment along with syrup Evecare 10 ml BD and Kanchnar Guggulu two BD.

She had taken my blood sample and it was negative. But, still I have not gotten my periods and it has been a week ahead. What could be the reason for my late periods?","Doctor":"Hello. As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses.

I have donated blood twice (in December and March respectively) and my hemoglobin level was 12.1 g/dL. Yesterday, I had gone to donate blood. But, I was not able to do so because of my low hemoglobin level (9.5 g/dL). I am just wondering if the drop in my hemoglobin level is because of my periods?","Doctor":"Hi. Hemoglobin (Hb) level does not drop down during your periods unless you have abnormally excessive bleeding. It could be a result of frequent blood donation. Maybe your body did not get enough time to regenerate the lost blood. So, give some time for your body to regenerate the lost blood. Take Iron supplements and VItamin B complex for six months. Repeat Hb check after six months. Once your Hb level is back to normal, you can donate blood again. Before you donate blood the next time, check your Hb level and consult a gynaecologist online -->"},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I am suffering from a 3.4 mm urinary stone.

You have a renal calculus (urinary stone) which is of very small size. Your doctor has advised you good medicines. So, continue the same. Hifenac SR (Aceclofenac) is a painkiller used to relieve the pain due to the stone. Pantocid (Pantoprazole) is to prevent gastric side effects. Nurokind is a multivitamin to make you feel better overall. The stone is quite small and hence if you keep drinking a lot of water, and stay hydrated, it will come out automatically while urinating. If the pain resolves after taking the medicines, in about a couple of week's time, then the stone would have definitely come out. If the pain persists even after two weeks, consult a urologist online -->"},{"Patient":"Hello doctor,My brother is undergoing psychiatric treatment form last 10 years.

I have three children of ages 4 and a half years, 2 years and 7 months.","Doctor":"Hello. Diastasis recti is a medical condition in which the abdominal muscle is separated into right and left halves. This occurs in pregnant women due to the stretching of the abdominal muscle during growth of uterus at the time of pregnancy.

Have a lot of green vegetables, fruits, fresh juices, etc. Drink plenty of water and fluids."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I have multiple small cysts in both ovaries (PCOS).

Then I had checked whether the cysts were dissolved by having an abdomen scan. But still, small multiple follicules have been seen in it with both ovaries enlarged. Kindly suggest me what I can do further. I got married before one and a half years and I am much worried about my pregnancy. I have gallstones as well.","Doctor":"Hello. I just read your query. See Kalarachi Kai choornam is helpful in amenorrhea. As far as small cysts are concerned they are unmatured eggs which failed to induce menstrual cycle previously, as a result, they got collected in the ovary and they will remain in the ovary. Now, you have got your periods you can start trying for conception. But I advise you to do it under the supervision of a nearby gynecologist because egg size is important while conception and that you can know by ovulation study. Ovulation study is performed under the supervision of a gynecologist. For gall stones, surgical intervention is required generally. Medicine is not of much help."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, My 27 year old son inhaled a fly. He is in good health with no respiratory distress.

Nothing major can happen since his breathing is fine. It is very unlikely that the fly may go into airway as there is a protective mechanism at the throat level.

Symptoms are present for many years but for the last two years, it has aggravated a lot. He does not leave the house or meet people, never speaks and blames me for everything. He behaves like a kid. He never helps anyone nor does he help anyone. Stays away from sympathy and love. Please advise me the treatment.","Doctor":"Hello. The problems you have mentioned like blaming you for his faults, not listening to others, irritability, anger outbursts, suspiciousness, remaining alone, etc., could be occurring due to some underlying mood disturbance. Suspiciousness could be due to some psychotic pathology. This should be evaluated by a psychiatrist. He does not go out and does not interact with others and this is resulting in impairment in functioning. These symptoms cannot be ignored. You have to take him to a psychiatrist. If he is not getting ready to visit, which he will do, then please visit a psychiatrist and discuss management. He might be suffering from bipolar disorder or some psychosis based upon the history you mentioned. But the final diagnosis should be made only after taking a detailed history. With medicines, he will be alright."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I have been suffering from chronic rhinitis for the past two years. After taking homeopathic help for the past six months, the condition is a bit better but not up to what I expected. The things that trigger my sneezing and cold are a change in the temperature like air conditioners and room temperature, eating orange and lemon, eating anything cold like ice-cream, cold drink, etc.","Doctor":"Hi. Your rhinoscopy nose examination also should be done to check polyp, deviated nasal septum, etc., like pathology, if present. These conditions can lead to repeated rhinitis. You can avoid cold as you are having an allergy of that. In excess cold climate, you can wear hot clothes. Citrus fruits are good for allergy. You can take one teaspoon turmeric powder with milk daily. During allergic rhinitis, you can be prescribed Fexofenadine tablet course which is an anti-allergic medication. It is better to consult otorhinolaryngologist for examination and accordingly further management."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I have a positive Widal test and liver function test showed a high eosinophil count.

I am wearing them for the second day. I am wearing it for about 12 hours a day. But I am noticing pain on my teeth now, and they are tight on my teeth. Should I have to wear them for 12 hours a day?","Doctor":"Hi. I have gone through your query, and I can understand your concern. Retainers are a passive appliance, and they do not generate any force. If you feel a pain on the mucous membrane (oral tissue or gums), it can be ill-fitted. If there is a pain on the teeth, then it can be active (imparting pressure). You do not need to wear them for more than 12 hours, especially when it is painful."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I am a 47-year-old male. Now, I have pain in my knee.

For knee pain, you can investigate with an X-ray or MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) scan of the knee joint. If there is any ligament injury in the knee joint, then it will be seen in the X-ray or MRI scan. You can consult an orthopedic surgeon for an examination. For numbness, you can investigate with serum B12 estimation, serum TSH estimation, random blood sugar estimation, SGOT (aspartate transaminase), SGPT (alanine transaminase), urea, and creatinine. If there is a need, NCV (nerve conduction velocity) study can be done."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I am 24 years old. Is it safe to consume alcohol in moderate level?

I am a breastfeeding mother for 6 months baby. I have a sore throat from yesterday and feel difficulty in swallowing with light fever but not continuous. Today my right eye is slightly reddish and I had a cough again but not continuous. Currently, I am taking Azithrol, Rantac, and Montec. These medicines were given to me while I had a cold before 1 month. Doctor said to continue it if I had further cold. I am frightened to go to doctor in this pandemic time. Please help.","Doctor":"Hi. Thanks for sharing your medical info with us. I totally understand your concern and I will try to recommend the best you can take to help you relieve your symptoms. Please do not take Montac and Rantac since they are not the best options for your current situation. You are dealing with an upper respiratory tract infection so you need relevant medications. Take Azithromycin tablet (two tablets on the first day then one for the next five days). Loratadine tablet is recommended, if not available go for Fexofenadine, both are perfect antihistamines with minimal to zero side effects (they are non-sedative unlike others). Tylenol is alright, it helps with the fever, and generalized symptoms, also safe while breastfeeding. Try an herbal cough depressant (the ones with ginger and honey). Take lots of fluids and I also recommend a bit of isolation at home, for a tiny chance of having the virus. I hope this helps."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor,I am trying to conceive but my husband and I did cocaine a week ago. How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

I have thoroughly gone through your case and can well understand your genuine health concerns. 1. No, there is not much problem right now as he vomited and also had a lot of water. It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases. Because, it is a volatile compound and causes vapors entering the lungs through the airways. 3. As it was only two drops, I do not think it may cause much trouble. If he feels short of breath contact me back, otherwise fine. 1. He should avoid re-exposure. 2.

For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations. If the size and number of cysts are more, then I suggest consulting a gynecologist as you may require surgery.

As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses.

As you are asymptomatic and the presence of blood in urine is observed only by a microscope, and the PSA increase is also minimal, I would suggest you repeat the urine analysis after three weeks.

I brushes a couple of times a day, nothing seems to be working. I have sinus and acidity problem too.","Doctor":"Hi. Bad breath is a common and a very irritating symptom of patients seeking dentist's help. Mint and mouth freshener are only short-term solutions. The long-term and permanent solution is to fight the reason that causes halitosis (the scientific term for bad breath). Bad breath can be caused by dental caries, oral infections or excessive tartar and plaque accumulation. Have you had your mouth checked by a dentist lately? Sinus problems such as chronic sinusitis is also a suitable reason for bad breath. In that case, sinus secretion stagnates, bacterias grow and as it flows on the back of your throat it causes a bad breath. Fixing this problem only can solve the bad breath problem. High stomach acidity and gastroesophageal reflux of stomach liquids can also cause a bad breath (although this is less likely to happen at your age and BMI). So what you need to do is to check your mouth for caries and oral plaque and tartar and have your sinus problem treated efficiently by an otorhinolaryngologist. Also, maintain your thorough brushing twice a day and do not forget to brush your tongue too because it is a place where bacteria grow. Use mint and mouth freshener too when it is needed as a short-term solution till the problem is solved."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, 4 years old had an MRI for hearing loss.

Unknown from fluid in ear or cyst. Can you please give me some information of what this is? I cannot sleep.","Doctor":"Hello. I read carefully your question and would explain that the dizziness is not related to the arachnoid cyst. You should know that arachnoid cysts are usually asymptomatic and they are present since birth. Anyway, sometimes if they grow, they may lead to seizures or motor or sensory deficits. For this reason, it is important consulting with a neurosurgeon. Follow up with brain MRI every year may be needed."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am 33 years old.

I am with a few cramps with progesterone and bed rest because of this brownish discharge. Is there any chance that I may have an abortion? I am very concerned and everyone is freaking out because Covid-19 and they do not want me to have another ultrasound should I need to be concerned?","Doctor":"Hi. I have seen your reports. (attachment removed to protect patient identity).  As of now, you are on the best treatment possible to prevent abortion as your gynecologist has already started you on Progesterone too because of your spotting, which is helpful in supporting the pregnancy. Yes, definitely having spotting in early pregnancy can pose you for risk of miscarriage but there is nothing more anyone can do that start with progesterone supports, and take good rest. Stay positive and everything should be fine hopefully. Avoid going out unnecessarily as the risk of Covid-19 can be more life-threatening. Once the crisis gets over you can follow up with your gynecologist for a follow up scan to check for the baby's heartbeat. Bed rest, continue progesterone, avoid intercourse."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, My mother is receiving breast cancer treatment for the past five years.

I can understand your concern. Cancer antigen 15-3 (CA 15-3) is a tumor marker. Its range is raised. It is alarming and highly suspicious to have the recurrence of the previously treated breast cancer. So it is better to repeat the test.

My blood pressure was high around 160/100. Maybe due to anxiety. I shall be having a TMT test tomorrow. What other tests I can take to know if this pain is angina pain or gas pain? Should I try Sorbitrate when I have pain and see if the pain has gone or not? Is TMT final test to know if there is any blockage or not?","Doctor":"Hi. I have reviewed your health query and can well understand your worries and want to add that, TMT (treadmill test) is not the only test to rule out if this pain is cardiac in origin or not. Although it is a very sophisticated screening test and we can find out if there is any change in electrical activity of heart when we put heart under stress to see how it behaves under stress. If there is any blockage in heart's arteries, heart would definitely change its behavior and under stress (at any point during TMT) heart's activity would not be as expected. Here would be our next strategy to start at. There are two possibilities. Normal or abnormal TMT. Normal TMT- Usually there is no need to further investigate. Abnormal TMT- Your cardiologist may go for further investigation including but not limited to coronary CTA, coronary angiography, etc.  No, you should not take any medications to test by yourself if this is cardiac pain or not. Discuss the matter with your cardiologist and if he feels appropriate, he may advise you accordingly. Ask your physician to get your blood pressure under control. This is high blood pressure and I think you should go for a proper work-up for hypertension. Your cardiologist would also help you in this regards."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor,I am trying to conceive but my husband and I did cocaine a week ago.

As per your CT scan (attachment removed to protect patient identity), there is some mucosal thickening in the left maxillary sinus and some inflammation in both posterior ethmoid sinuses. The nasal passage are very much compromised. The turbinates are hypertrophied. This may be due to sinusitis as well as your smoking shisha.

Three drain tubes were inserted into the pleura to drain off the fluids. This all happened seven months back. My husband has been experiencing pain in his left lung area since. Is this normal? Could the drain tubes piercing the pleura be the cause of the pain he is still experiencing? If yes, will it heal over time or does the holes stay? I have read that the nerve endings are in the plurea for the lungs, could the pockets of fluid he had cause nerve damage?","Doctor":"Hello. I went through your husband's history provided by you. By PE I assume you are referring to pulmonary embolism and not pericardial effusion. Are the tubes still present? If so the tube rubbing the pleura while taking a deep breath can cause the pain. Pulmonary embolism which may have cut off blood supply to part of the lung can cause the pain. If the tubes have been removed, the holes will heal in a couple of weeks. That will not cause the pain.  In the case of pleural effusions, when they heal, it can cause some thickening of the outer layer of pleura which will limit the expansion of the lungs to some extent. This thickening can cause some pain and discomfort on deep breaths. This may persist for some time. In majority, this pain diminishes over time."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I had a molar removed two years ago in the upper right area. Since then the hole has never healed. It goes right up into the nasal cavity. Air passes right through my mouth into the nose. Several sinus infections are there.","Doctor":"Hi. I got your chief complaint and I have arrived at a conclusion that it is a case of oro-antral fistula which had been caused by traumatic extraction of molar tooth particularly upper molars. Due to either over instrumentation by a dentist. The symptoms of this problem are difficulty in eating food and air passing through the nose. This condition leads to sinusitis which frequently gets infected.  The treatment strategy includes askingyour nearby oral and maxillofacial surgeon to close the defect. It can need a minor surgical procedure. The dentist should have noticed this early and corrected but it seems an error on his part. Though I diagnosed your problem with your history, it would be better if you can tell me precisely which tooth is this or you can send an attachment photograph of the area. Moreover, if you have any radiograph do send me."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I am unable to clear my tummy entirely in the morning. It is happening for a couple of weeks. I thought that I have an infection. So I did a CBC. But the reports came fine. I have hypothyroidism, and I am taking Thyronorm 12.5 mg. A friend told me that it could be a colon or rectal cancer. Can I have cancer? Please suggest.","Doctor":"Hi. On considering your age, the possibility of having cancer is unlikely. There is nothing to worry. Constipation is a widespread problem, and the chance of cancer is doubtful to occur in this age group. So do not think about this disease. Cancer usually occurs at elder age with alternate constipation and diarrhea. It happens with blood in stools, weight loss, and abdominal pain. Their profile would be entirely different. You can have hypothyroidism induced constipation. You should do a TSH to see the thyroid control. For that, you should eat a high fiber diet with fruits such as apple, banana, oranges, green leafy vegetables like spinach, and raw cucumber. Avoid taking refined food, fatty, and oily food. You should take plenty of fluids and do regular exercise. Take syrup lactulose 15 ml at bedtime to maintain your stool soft. Use it when there is a need."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, Please explain my mother’s latest test reports. Currently, she is taking Ramistar, Atorva, and Ecosprin. Please suggest.","Doctor":"Hi. I have gone through the reports (attachment removed to protect patient identity). The overall report is fine with some minor abnormalities. First, her hemoglobin is slightly low, which is likely due to an iron deficiency. So it is advisable to undergo a serum iron study. If it is deficient, then she can take iron supplements. She should take plenty of green leafy vegetables. Alternatively, she can also take an iron supplement like tablet Fericip XT (Elemental iron with Folic acid) once a day after lunch. Her vitamin D level is low. So she can take tablet Uprise D3 60,000 units (Cholecalciferol) once a week for eight weeks. It has to be taken for six months. Her FSH (follicle stimulating hormone) and LH (luteinizing hormone) are elevated. It occurs due to her age and menopause."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, My fasting blood sugar is 159.8 mg/dL. My postprandial blood sugar is 280.7 mg/dL. My BP is 160 by 90 mmHg.","Doctor":"Hi. From your laboratory report, I can see your blood glucose levels at a higher level than its normal range. HbA1C level (glycosylated hemoglobin) in blood will give us a better idea about your blood sugar control. You may need to start a treatment to reduce the blood sugar levels. Also, your blood pressure is also slightly high. Treatment for reducing your blood pressure and blood sugar will require a detailed study of your past medical history, your family history, your drug history and also a detailed clinical examination. It is difficult to achieve all this soon. I suggest you meet a doctor for proper clinical evaluation and subsequent treatment of your condition. Try to avoid taking processed sugar and sweets, and salty food. Take increased intake of water and raw vegetables, and try to do exercise for at least 30 minutes daily."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I am a 16-year-old boy. I had thick hair. Recently, I started applying conditioner on my hair. I have lost my hair after using conditioner on the scalp. My mother has thick hair. My father has a bald head. I want to get my thick hair again. I am living in depression. I am unable to concentrate on my studies. I do not know whether the hair loss is temporary or not. I also have small patches between my hairs. What can it be? What can I do to get a thick hair again? Is it right to use Minoxidil now? Please help me.","Doctor":"Hi. It can be a side effect of a conditioner. Sometimes, the chemicals present in the conditioners are quite strong, and they lead to a negative impact on the hair, causing hair loss. As a first step, stop using conditioners. Secondly, you have told about the small patches present between the hairs. It can be a fungal infection causing hair loss. Wash your hair twice a week with a mild shampoo. Use Ketaconazole based shampoo for every 15 days. It can be a medicated anti-dandruff or anti-fungal shampoo. You can take vitamin supplements for a month. Take vitamin biotin and other vitamin B complex foods. Also, take vitamin C. Eat healthy food and lots of green leafy vegetables. Also, add dry fruits to your diet. Take almonds, walnuts, resins, and cashews. You do not need to use Minoxidil now. Your hair fall can stop by following these steps. Do not worry. Reduce your stress. If the hair fall persists, please consult a nearby doctor to check whether there is an infection of hair or not. If there is an infection, specific management can be done. If you do not have an infection, the use of Minoxidil can be evaluated."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I have acid erosion or decay in the back of my bottom front teeth.

I can understand your concern. I will recommend you to brush your teeth twice daily after breakfast and before going to bed. You can visit a dentist but keep in mind do not go for any X-ray but there is no problem with filling (dental restoration) (attachment removed to protect patient identity). Use ultra soft toothbrush because erosion of teeth increases more and more abrasion too. So do not use a hard toothbrush and also limit your tooth brushing up to 2 to 3 minutes only. Avoid painkillers during the pregnancy period and use desensitizing toothpaste if you feel any sensitivity."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I have missed my period for a month, and he inserted his penis tip into me. But he did not do an ejaculation. Please solve my doubt.","Doctor":"Hi. If the ejaculation is not done in the vagina, then there is no chance of getting pregnant. The delay could be because of hormonal changes. Get a urine pregnancy test done with an early morning urine sample to confirm pregnancy."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I cannot control my mind from using internet. Please share with me if any solutions are available.","Doctor":"Hello. I understand your problem. Social media kind of increase dopamine levels in the brain.

Reward yourself when you complete the task. This would definitely help you."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, My wife is losing protein in the urine. The result is ++.

How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

I have thoroughly gone through your case and can well understand your genuine health concerns. 1. No, there is not much problem right now as he vomited and also had a lot of water. It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases. Because, it is a volatile compound and causes vapors entering the lungs through the airways. 3. As it was only two drops, I do not think it may cause much trouble. If he feels short of breath contact me back, otherwise fine. 1. He should avoid re-exposure. 2.

For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations. If the size and number of cysts are more, then I suggest consulting a gynecologist as you may require surgery.

As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses.

My HbA1c is 12. What should I do?","Doctor":"Hi. According to diabetes guidelines, the patient should have strict diabetic control pre-pregnancy. It is better to have a strict diabetic diet and sugar levels within the normal range and have HbA1c less than 6. Frankly speaking, I feel that during conception, less than 6 or 5 would be better but at 10, it is advised not to conceive but I think after conception it would have increased. As with high sugar levels, more chances of congenital anomalies in the fetus are there, most popular is heart defects. The baby could have diabetes and could grow fast due to sugar levels imbalance and can be large for the gestational age. It can have stillbirth, difficult delivery, intrauterine death, etc. Please contact maternal medicine consultant obstetrician and discuss your detailed history and treatment till now. In pregnancy, Insulin is preferred over oral medications. Have a strict diabetic diet, daily walk, yoga, or mild exercises. Try to have strict monitoring of fetus as well as your sugar levels.

My first PE study was done with a protective shielding on my chest to reduce the radiation to my breasts. I did not have any shielding on my second study. During my third study also, I did not have any shielding. They used a dose on pediatric mode resulting in 6 mSv radiation. I have no plans on receiving a CT again. I am willing to know the risk for having cancer from these scans. I have also done a lung MRIs for monitoring the growth. I would like to know it from a radiologist point. I am worried about developing cancer at this point. I have also done an abdominal and pelvic CT before two years.","Doctor":"Hi. CT of the head might have given you two mSv radiation. CT of the abdomen and pelvis might have given you 14 mSv radiation. CT scan of the chest might have given you 45 mSv radiation. The total radiation dose received approximately is 61 mSv. You might have an additional cancer risk of 0.842011 %. We have used a standard data to calculate the maximum possible dose. As the dose used was six mSv, then the risk is less.

I am not sure, but there were very few drops of blood. So, should I take the anti-rabies vaccine? Is it completely safe to take it even without a dog bite? Any side effect in future if you take it without dog bite?","Doctor":"Hello. The anti-rabies vaccine should be taken if there is a dog bite or dog licks the mucous membrane like nose, eyes or mouth or wounded skin or a dog scratch. Wash the wound completely under running tap water with soap for 15 minutes. Watch and observe the dog for a period of 10 days for any unnatural behavior, activities or death. There are no dietary restrictions before or after a rabies vaccine. Vegetarian, as well as non-vegetarian food, is allowed, but do not consume alcohol while under treatment. Do not take any other vaccine other than tetanus (if required) during the treatment protocol. So, in your case, you do require the vaccine cover as a scratch requires the vaccine.

If it is not more mobile, then it will get healed soon within 15 days. If it is fractured or more mobile, then you may need other procedures like splinting using wires to fix the teeth.

I have thoroughly gone through your case and can well understand your genuine health concerns. 1. No, there is not much problem right now as he vomited and also had a lot of water. It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases. Because, it is a volatile compound and causes vapors entering the lungs through the airways. 3. As it was only two drops, I do not think it may cause much trouble. If he feels short of breath contact me back, otherwise fine. 1. He should avoid re-exposure. 2. Rule out if there is some sort of suicidal ideation due to depression or anxiety and take him to a psychiatrist for physical evaluation.

I used it for 30 days continuously, but no use. How many days should I take that powder and how to overcome this problem?","Doctor":"Hello. For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations. If the size and number of cysts are more, then I suggest consulting a gynecologist as you may require surgery. If the number and size of cysts are less, you may continue treatment along with syrup Evecare 10 ml BD and Kanchnar Guggulu two BD.

She had taken my blood sample and it was negative. But, still I have not gotten my periods and it has been a week ahead. What could be the reason for my late periods?","Doctor":"Hello. As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses.

I do not have pain in that tooth now. Is it right to have a new filling on that tooth or can I have a dental crown on that tooth? Is it possible to have a crown on that tooth? Is it a complicated procedure?","Doctor":"Hi. A filling can be placed again, and the tooth is contoured correctly. A composite can be used to build the tooth and then the tooth can be contoured adequately. Then a crown can be placed. If the tooth is not broken much, then a cutting can be done, and a crown can be placed. If the crown of the tooth is broken more, a post and core can be used. All these measures are taken depending on the status of the crown structure. These measures are entirely noncomplicated and can be done without a problem. Please send a photograph of the tooth.

No other problem.","Doctor":"Hello. I understand your concern. Sputum coming out while getting up in the morning could be related to any stomach issue especially if you are having acid reflux or other hyperacidity problems of the stomach. If you have been taking any antibiotic recently, candida infection of the mouth can also be the cause.  I advise running a sputum culture and sensitivity testing to determine if the problem is an infection (bacterial or candida) or from acid reflux. If any sign of acid reflux, run upper endoscopy for determination, consult with a dentist to evaluate the status of your teeth and gums. Run complete blood count, measure blood electrolytes to rule out dehydration. For the moment, I advise to keep good oral hygiene, keep well hydrated, and eat healthily."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, My stools are well-formed. But I go multiple times. Many years ago, I used to pass loose stools. I took Ayurveda treatment for eight days. It gave me good results. How can I reduce my number of seats? Please suggest.","Doctor":"Hi. Passing stools frequently in well-formed consistency indicates the history of grahani roga. It correlates with IBS (irritable bowel syndrome). If it is associated with pain, burning, and stool with mucus, then it is diagnosed as colitis. You can manage them naturally by taking ayurvedic medicines and by doing yoga practices. Take these medicines regularly for one month. Take Bilva Avaleha (Baelphal with Avaleha) one teaspoon twice a day before having food. Take Dadimastaka Churna (Vamsha with Nagakesara) three grams twice a day with warm water. Take Kutajaghana Vati (Kutaj herb) two tablets twice a day with warm water after having meals. Take Pipallyasava (Amla with Lodhra) 15 ml twice a day with an equal amount of water after having meals. Avoid taking spicy and fried junk foods. Avoid smoking and drinking if you have these habits. Avoid taking milk and milk products, tea, coffee, cold drinks, soft drinks, and ice creams. Eat fibrous foods and fruits as well as green leafy vegetables. Do regular kapalbhati and mandukasana as well as pranayamas like anuloma vilom, Nadi sodhana pranayama, and bhramari pranayama. Do these things and provide your valuable feedback after fifteen days."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I recently went for a checkup for hepatitis B.

Since two days I am observing that his diapers are not wet and heavy as they used to be. So I checked his urine output by laying him down without a diaper for five hours and fed him twice with two and a half hours gap between each feed. He peed thrice after the first feed with 20 minutes gap and he did not pee until he had his second feed. After the second feed, he peed thrice with 20 to 30 minutes gap. Recently, I have reduced his feeding amount on pediatrician advice as he was vomiting. I used to feed him up to 100 ml with 3 to 4 hours gap and now I am feeding him 60 to 70 ml with 2.5 hours gap.

Please advise me if this is normal since I feel that his urine has decreased compared to previously. His weight is 4.5 kg checked 20 days before.","Doctor":"Hello. I understand your concern for your baby. Your baby should urinate 6 to 8 times per day. As you have told that the baby peed after feeds, this seems absolutely normal. You may just keep a track on total 24 hours urine. Should be 6 to 8 times in a day. Reducing feed amount is fine but feed every 2 to 3 hourly and on-demand feeding.  Why are you not breastfeeding? Is there any problem? If it is there, it should be addressed. The bottle feeds increase the risk of infection. The stools 3 to 4 times is normal.

You are having a problem in deciding the power of glasses to be made. I can give you the following suggestions. Choose the power which is felt the best when you are undergoing testing. Choose the power which has the most precise vision, with no distortions, with no variations in the size of objects, and there is no eye strain. Most patients will get satisfied with this power. Choose the power which was given to you after verification using dilating eye drops. This test involves instilling dilating eye drops which blurs your vision. You are usually asked to come back to recheck on another day or sometimes prescribed glasses on the same day. This verification decreases the chances of error. An error of 0.25 diopter and an axis shift of less than 5 degrees is not noticeable in most circumstances. So if your glasses differ from each other by only small degrees, you can choose any one of them."},{"Patient":"hello sir/madam actually my father has DM ,htn ,psoriasis and psoriasis arthritis. now from some days he has neck stiffness, sudden severe head ache . pain usually start from back of the head or temple side . pain start anytime throungout the day . weakness in leg . hand tingling. walking weakness . sir the is suddenly occur 2 or 3 times a day. please help. gabapin 100mg ,betacap 20 mg and naxxdom 250 at sos. these three medinice are recenty prescribe by local medical. note i have latest Ct scan available.","Doctor":"Hello. Welcome to icliniq. The symptoms that you have mentioned in your father suggest towards brain infection or meningitis/encephalitis or cerebral vascular accident/cva which means either a bleeding from the vessels or blockage in the vessels. The good thing is that the most lethal out of the above which is bleeding in the brain has been ruled out by the CT scan. The other things still need to be ruled out by some more evaluation. Based on all this I will be able to narrow down my differential diagnosis but you still need to visit a doctor in the hospital where they would examine your father completely and will be able to come to a diagnosis. Your father might need a lumbar puncture test in which a needle is inserted into the back to take minute quantity of csf which is the fluid that circulated around the brain to come to a diagnosis and for all these things he would need to go to the hospital.

How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

He vomited and had lot of salt water. Please advice for any side effect.","Doctor":"Hi. I want to assure you not to worry as everything is going to be fine if proper care and treatment is opted in for. I have thoroughly gone through your case and can well understand your genuine health concerns. 1. No, there is not much problem right now as he vomited and also had a lot of water. It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases. Because, it is a volatile compound and causes vapors entering the lungs through the airways. 3. As it was only two drops, I do not think it may cause much trouble. If he feels short of breath contact me back, otherwise fine. 1. He should avoid re-exposure. 2. Rule out if there is some sort of suicidal ideation due to depression or anxiety and take him to a psychiatrist for physical evaluation. For further follow up consult a general practitioner online.--->"},{"Patient":"Hello doctor,As I have PCOD problem and also cyst, I take tablets for period. My friend suggested Kalachikai powder. I used it for 30 days continuously, but no use. How many days should I take that powder and how to overcome this problem?","Doctor":"Hello. For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations. If the size and number of cysts are more, then I suggest consulting a gynecologist as you may require surgery. If the number and size of cysts are less, you may continue treatment along with syrup Evecare 10 ml BD and Kanchnar Guggulu two BD.

She had taken my blood sample and it was negative. But, still I have not gotten my periods and it has been a week ahead. What could be the reason for my late periods?","Doctor":"Hello. As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses. For further information consult an obstetrician and gynaecologist online -->"},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I have a sore throat since this Wednesday. My dad is a doctor and he gave me Augmentin every 12 hours. The pain has not gone yet, but I feel like an object anytime I swallow. It hurts and it feels dry and sore. Just on the left side, it is been a few days but nothing new yet. It hurts everytime I swallow and it feels full and pressured. There is some yellow mucus close to the crypts but cannot understand if it is a stone or infection. I tried to remove possible stones but ended up making my tonsil bleed every time I try to clean possible stones and gargled with salt and water. I am really afraid it is something bad. I am 24 years old.","Doctor":"Hello. Your tonsil looks infected (attachment removed to protect patient identity). I can see pus coming out of your tonsil. You complete the course of Augmentin (take it for seven days, 1 gm 12 hourly). Along with that take plenty of fluids (at room temperature i.e. not very cold and not very hot), do mouth gargles (combination of Chlorhexidine and Benzydamine) three times daily for five days which will soothe your throat as well as remove debris from the crypts. Take proton pump inhibitor (Pantoprazole 40 mg twice daily on empty stomach for a week) and also Paracetamol 650 mg thrice daily for three days. Do take all the medicines, just Augmentin is not enough. Do not touch your tonsils and do not try to remove the debris with fingers. Also, if possible send more pictures of your throat. I want to see your right tonsil and posterior pharyngeal wall clearly."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I had my first intercourse 10 days back and after that, I had taken I-pill within 24 hours and now it has been two weeks and I am still having some brown spots. Is it due to I-pill? How may days does it bleed? Is it normal or I should visit a doctor? Or should I wait for my next cycle?","Doctor":"Hello, Welcome to icliniq.ciom. The brownish spotting is due to withdrawal bleed following I-pill intake but the bleeding usually lasts only 4 to 5 days. If the bleeding is continuing, it would be best to rule out any chances of pregnancy with a serum beta hCG test first and if negative then you can opt for anti-fibrinolytic to control the bleeding."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor,I am feeling pain in my anus while passing stool, feel like have developed hemorrhoids. Please suggest. I am 37 years old.","Doctor":"Hello. First thing is your stool should be soft. For that, you should eat high fiber diet like fruits, apple, banana, oranges, green leafy vegetables like spinach, raw cucumber. Avoid smoking, refined food, fatty, and oily food. You should have plenty of fluids and regular exercises. Also, syrup like Cremaffin plus 15 to 30 ml bedtime to maintain your stool soft. Second, you can use 2 % Lidocaine gel before each stool so as to relieve pain. It is better if you can get examined by a local doctor to confirm the diagnosis."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, For the past three days, I am noticing that my bowel color is pale or clay color. I do not have a fever or loose motion. I have mild cramp in my lower stomach also. Please note that I had gastritis issue few months back and had taken medication. Could you please answer my questions? Is this something serious issue with liver or gallbladder? I have read that it is a serious issue if bowel color is pale or clay color. Is this related to the same? Is it related to gastritis issue? Is it related to cirrhosis? Please advise.","Doctor":"Hi. A pale stool is one of the normal variants of stool, though it occurs infrequently. If persistent it indicates an obstruction in the biliary tree leading to stasis of the bilirubin in the liver and causing stool pale. We should think about hepatitis or obstruction of the biliary system at a different level. If this is physiological, it will improve without any specific intervention.  It may or may not be serious, I explained above. It depends on the cause of the pale stool. It is a normal variant or related to biliary disorders. Initially it may not be associated with cirrhosis, later on, in case of long-standing obstruction of the biliary tree, it may cause. Physiological, acute hepatitis, extrahepatic biliary obstruction. Liver function test, complete blood count, amylase, ultrasound abdomen. Continue normal diet. Review back with reports."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I have herpes zoster. Should I consult a dermatologist or a general physician? My age is 24. What kind of diet has to be taken?","Doctor":"Hi. Herpes zoster is a dermatology condition. It is a viral reactivation. It has to be treated as soon as possible to prevent the postherpetic neuralgia (residual pain). It is the varicella virus, not related to diet. You can continue taking your regular diet with 2 to 3 liters of water per day. Need to avoid excessive physical work or exercise. Rest is very important. Can you please upload the pictures so that I can see the area of involvement? Since how many days you have this?"},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I had a blister forming five months later after a massage. No blowjob was involved but it ended with a handjob. Had a full STD done. The result came back with herpes 1 diagnosis with a 1.1 result (the test was done 21 days after the massage). Test result 21 days after massage: HSV type 1 IgG AB 1.1.","Doctor":"Hello. It appears to be herpes only (attachment removed to protect patient identity). It is not clear on the image, but it appears to be a fluid-filled vesicle, so suggest a strong possibility of herpes only. Another factor which would favor herpes is the presence of pain. Was there any pain in those vesicles, if yes, then it further makes herpes a strong possibility. Next thing, history of hand job further add to the possibility. If you get lesion anytime, please get a swab and PCR (polymerized chain reaction) done. Also, get HSV 1 and 2 antibodies level done now."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, When I wake up from my sleep, I feel empty. I am not willing to do my work. I neglect my study. I always stay alone in my room. I am feeling lonely. I got a breakup. After having a breakup, my depression got worse. I am crying every day for around seven months. I am unable to focus anymore, and I am unable to do my work. Please help.","Doctor":"Hi. You are in a troubled situation. Having an empty feeling and negative thoughts occurring on an occasional basis are quite reasonable. It does happen to everyone. But having a low opinion, and feeling empty for so long, around seven months is not healthy. It indicates that you need help. You are suffering from depression which needs to be addressed soon. Without proper treatment and care, it will get worsen further. Try to follow these steps. It can help you. Try to follow your daily routine work. Do not be alone. Try sitting with people. Do deep breathing exercise. You can try meditation and yoga. Eat a healthy nutritious diet and avoid taking junk foods. Try to have psychiatric counseling soon."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I have injured urinary bladder and the left side ureter during hysterectomy surgery by laparoscopy. Then, cystoscopy and nephrostomy were done. A catheter is used. Can surgery be done again?","Doctor":"Hi. I have gone through your query and the reports of your surgery (attachment removed to protect patient identity). There has been an inadvertent injury to your left ureter and bladder. The details of the bladder injury are not clear in the summary given, but should most likely be repaired. The nephrostomy done will help in maintaining the function of the left kidney, until it is safe to do surgery again.  You will need surgery to repair the injury to the ureter, usually done after 3 to 6 weeks. The results of this surgery are usually very good when performed by a trained urologist. Once the surgery is successful, the nephrostomy can be removed."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I want to go for a corrective surgery and am confused between Contoura and SMILE. I request you to please give your opinion on the following doubts of mine. People say that all LASIK surgeries involve greater cornea related risks which SMILE does not. Your view on this? While for SMILE people say that actual corneal depth removed is more and even the appearance objects after SMILE is very artificial and is not as sharp or 3D like in Contura. Your view on this? Also, is there any clause like if one is not able to focus eyes on point or concentrate (which is totally in hand of the patient in SMILE) then he should not opt for SMILE as there is a risk of hurting eye. Is that true? Also, irrespective of which one we do, are these surgeries always accompanied by halos, glares and night vision problems? Finally, I am getting married in two months and I would be required to indulge myself in all the dance rehearsals, makeup, market traveling, etc. What do you think, is it the right time to go for a surgery? And which one (that is less risky and recovers faster)?","Doctor":"Hello. 1. If LASIK has greater corneal risk than a SMILE? This is true. LASIK does have a greater risk of flap-related complications. In SMILE, as there is no flap created, there are no complications associated with it. 2. Corneal depth in LASIK vs SMILE. The depth in LASIK is dependent on your refractive error. The more your refractive error, the more will the tissue abated. In SMILE, the thickness of the lenticular is preset by the surgeon and does not depend on the refractive error. In both procedures, the surgeon can also take measures to conserve thickness. So the answer is that it depends on the surgeon and your refractive error. 3. The sharpness of images Contoura vs SMILE. There are various studies done on this and a majority say that SMILE offers better results in most laboratory tests, but under practical and daily life situations, it can be assumed that both are pretty much the same. 4. Can hurt your eye in SMILE if you do not concentrate on a point? I am not very sure about the exact context of the question. I can tell you that in both surgeries you will be asked to look at a pointer light and the accuracy of your correction will depend on how well you maintain a fixed gaze on the pointer. If you look any other way for even a fraction of a second the outcome will be bad in both of the procedures. 5. Glare halos and night vision problems. These will be present soon after surgery in both, but will slowly resolve. Not a major problem in a majority of the patients. 6. Right time for surgery, which surgery is less risky and has a faster recovery? Right time for surgery would be around three months from your wedding, although some do get SMILE done just one day before their wedding. Anytime before 1 to 2 months, you will be in the recovery phase and will have to be instilling eyedrops- a bothersome task when piled along with shopping and organizing tasks before the event. 7. Less risky and has faster recovery- SMILE (small incision lenticule extraction)."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I have a mind flip problem. My emotions get changed every hour. I am studying and living in a hostel. I have the feeling of loneliness. I do not want to be alone. I do not know how to deal with it.","Doctor":"Hi. Mood swings with frequent low mood episodes can occur due to lots of causes. If there is variation in a menstrual cycle, it can be a premenstrual syndrome. If you have a predominantly low mood, it can be dysthymia which is a low grade chronic long-term depression. As you are living in a hostel, it is very obvious to lack proper family support. You should have adequate talk to your parents. I know it is tough to visit your home frequently as you are studying. Try to share your thoughts with your friends. Make such friends who listen to you and take proper care of you. If still, you face the similar problem, I would suggest you visit a psychiatrist for appropriate assessment. Do not worry. I am sure that you will be fine with a proper friend and family support. You do not require antidepressants or mood stabilizer drugs."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am 60, weight is 44 kg, height is 5.6, diabetes for past 25 years, on low carbohydrate diet for 80 days, taking no medicine for diabetes now. Sugar levels are under control, checking every day. The problem from past 50 days is that there are feet and ankle swelling that disappears in the morning and comes back by night. No pain or weight loss. Kidney function test, liver function test, 2D echo, thyroid test, HbA1C, lipid profile, stool examination, B12 tests were done. Met local doctor, and he said it is nutritional pedal edema or malabsorption. Prescribed below medicine. Oroalbumen powder three times for 30 days. Revidox LB twice a day for five days. Lasilactone 25 mg once in the morning for three days. Along with the above, taking Thyronorm 25 mcg, Vitamin C, multivitamin tablet, Omega 3 fish oil, Ecosprin 75. It has been three days, did not see much improvement. Vitamin B12 was 1271. My questions are why is Vitamin B12 high? Could this be small intestine bacterial overgrowth? Taking lots of proteins and healthy food, but no use. Could you please help to get the food absorbed.","Doctor":"Hi. High vitamin B12 can result from multiple causes. Since your liver function test, kidney function test, peripheral blood smear, etc., are normal (attachment removed to protect patient identity), we can rule out these as the cause. Other causes like diabetes (which you have as evidenced by HBA1c), nonvegetarian diet (do not know your status) and vitamin supplementation (which you are on) can also cause mild elevations. Small intestinal bacterial overgrowth results in Vitamin B12 deficiency."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I was attacked by mumps around three years back and now my testicle sizes are different. So, I wanted to know about the treatment. Will I get rejected in visa medical test? I am a petroleum engineer. Please help.","Doctor":"Hello. I had gone through all the details posted. The difference in size of the testicles is mainly because of two reasons, orchitis and hydrocele. Orchitis is inflammation of the testicles, which has happened three years back due to mumps. There will be redness, pain and no fluid around the testis. For decrease of swelling and pain, we need to use anti-inflammatory agents. If there is any bacterial infection, then we need to use antibiotics. In case of hydrocele, if the inflammation is more, then the fluid will be formed around the testis, which needs ultrasound and clinical examination for diagnosis. If there is fluid around the testis, then it can be removed by surgery. If you have hydrocele, there is chance for rejection to foreign countries. So, you may need to be operated. If it is only different size of the testis and no fluid, then there may not be a chance for rejection. So, you need to consult a general surgeon and get an ultrasound of the scrotum for further management.
