The skin around my vulva and anus is red and it keeps cracking or bleeding. The skin around my anus is also flaky and yellow in some places. It is itchy and is causing me serious embarrassment.

I also got an itchy flaky scalp and occasionally get flaky skin on my eyelids. What could this be and how can I get it treated?","Doctor":"Hi. I have read your query in detail and viewed the attached pictures (attachment removed to protect patient identity) and do understand your concern. 1. Itchy and flaky scalp and eyelids indicates seborrheic capitis and dermatitis or dandruff.  2. For that, you can use Ketoconazole based shampoo on your scalp twice a week.  3. You can apply Betamethasone lotion on your scalp over the itchy areas twice daily for one week.  4. Apply Hydrocortisone cream over the eyes once daily for seven days and then stop. Constant unremitting itching over the vulva could be due to lichen sclerosus. 1. The mainstay of treatment will be topical steroids. In addition, you may take Fluconazole 150 mg orally once weekly for two weeks. 2. Use a non-soap cleanser. 3. Take oral antihistamines, for example tablet Hydroxyzine 25 mg at night. 4. Avoid constant itching or rubbing. It will aggravate the symptoms. 5. Apply emollients for relief and to avoid itching. Loose cotton based clothing and inner wear will be helpful.

For some time now, probably 6 months or more, I also began feeling that my legs were heavy and just general weakness all over, not really muscle weakness. I am also a gastric bypass patient and have a history of low B12, iron saturation and low vitamin D. To complicate matters even more, I went to an orthopedic spine specialist about a month ago, due to the stiffness in my neck. I was unable to turn side to side and this has been going on for several years, like 5 or more. Also, I have a sharp pain between my shoulder blades. My cervical MRI shows moderate facet joint arthritis, small central spur on C5-C6 and some compression of the spinal cord. Even more complicated is that the MRI showed thyroid nodules and the ultrasound reported as typical of a multinodular goiter. My TSH was 4.18. I visited my family doctor and he said that the twitches were probably from low vitamin B12. He gave me an injection yesterday and took blood to measure B12 and vitamin D. My vitamin B12 is more than 2000 and vitamin D is 9. I am going insane thinking that I have some horrible neurological disorder with the twitches and tingling in my calves, general fatigue and heavy feeling of my legs when I walk. My primary care physician did a strength test on arms and legs and said it was normal. Can low vitamin B12 and vitamin D cause these symptoms? I just feel weird and scared.","Doctor":"Hi. Vitamin B12 deficiency can cause subacute combined degeneration of the cord. So, the treatment is daily Vitamin B12 or Vitamin B complex supplementation for 12 weeks. Your vitamin D levels are also low. The treatment is Vitamin D capsules 60000 IU every Sunday for 12 weeks. In your present scenario, for twitching, the first line of management is vitamin B12 supplementation and vitamin D supplementation. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and take the medicines with consent for 12 weeks and you will have a dramatic improvement in the next three months.

First I noticed it in the legs, around my calves, arms and even on my back. It has been fairly noticeable around my shoulders, and biceps. At one point I even noticed my right eye twitching whenever I blinked, though the eye twitch has not happened in a few weeks now, so maybe that was just due to a lack of sleep? My concern is that the muscle twitching is still felt pretty much all around my body, mostly my legs though sometimes in the arms and even in my stomach. I noticed that the leg twitching happens when I am at rest, with either my legs up on the recliner or in bed. If I am walking or standing I have yet to notice a thing. I have gone to see my GP doctor and she is attributing it to stress, anxiety or side effects of an anti-depressant drugs that she prescribed. (Though it has now been seven weeks since my last dose and I am still feeling the muscle twitches. During the span of these last two months, on three separate occasions, I have felt very weak for a day. Not to the point that I could not get out of bed, but definitely fatigued enough to do any daily activity, the feeling was like I was anemic. At times, I would feel like even my arm bones had some weakness. I would make myself walk around the neighborhood to let some fresh air, circulation. Do some self-evaluation tests like walking backward or one foot in front of the other, or even standing on one foot. The weird thing is that after a day, I would feel slightly better. After the second day, I would feel back to my normal self (but with the twitching). I started taking a Magnesium supplement because I had heard that it helped with calming down the mind and also helped with muscles. After two weeks it has not stopped the spasms. So, last week I went back to see my doctor and they had me run a magnesium blood test and I was just sent the results. Everything came back normal with the exception of vitamin D 25-OH being low at 26 ng/ml. Magnesium was at 2.3 and calcium was at 9.2. She did not order a B12 analysis so I am not sure if that is low as well. I have made an appointment with the GP to go over the results, but I am getting a little concerned because of the twitching that is not going away and now the low vitamin D result. Do you think this can all be attributed to the low vitamin D level? I fear that I may have an underlying condition such as ALS or MS since that is pretty much what you find when researching these symptoms.","Doctor":"Hello. I understand your concern and would explain that the muscle twitching could be related to low vitamin D levels. For this reason, it is important to take Vitamin D supplements. I would also recommend checking vitamin B12 plasma levels for possible deficiency and performing nerve conduction studies in order to examine your muscles and nerves. You should discuss with your doctor on the above tests. If all the above tests result normal, you should also consider benign fasciculations syndrome as a possible cause underlying your complaints. Anxiety could be playing an important role in all this clinical situation too. For this reason, I would recommend avoiding caffeine and trying Yoga."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor,Can Terbinaforce plus cream be used for a vaginal infection? I have itching after periods.

By the symptoms you are describing it seems like a viral infection (some kind of flu). Headache, joints ache, fever, and respiratory problems are common in this condition. Since you have a history of a week and the symptoms are back, bacterial infections of the respiratory tract as a complication may have occured. I would suggest you to have a complete blood count done, and throat secretions culture. If you have breathing difficulty, cough or chest pain, do an X-ray of the chest.  If bacterial infection is proven, a specific cure with antibiotics should be started. Until then you have to control your symptoms by a support therapy. Take Ibuprofen every six hours for the fever and pain, Vitamin C to increase the immunity strength and electrolytes (ORS orally). Have light meals, soups, and plenty of liquids.

There is no pus but just itchiness.","Doctor":"Hi. It seems the rash and itching on the inner thighs could probably be due to a fungal infection of the skin. This is very common especially in tropical countries and more so in the hot humid summers. To accurately diagnose the same, further information like images of the affected area, total duration of the rash, any other areas affected, any discoloration of nails, etc., are needed. If it is indeed a fungal infection the following can be kept in mind. Treatment of fungal infections includes applications which contain Ketoconazole, Sertaconazole, Luliconazole, etc. Oral antifungals like Terbinafine and Itraconazole are often used in combination for better clearance and reducing recurrences. Local hygiene is very important. Taking bath daily, drying the skin folds after bath, keeping soap and towels separate and drying your clothes in sunlight and ironing them before wearing will help to kill the fungal spores. So, I will recommend evaluation by a dermatologist to decide on the treatment.

I have read your query in detail and viewed the attached pictures (attachments removed to protect patient identity) and understood your concern. 1. You can get KOH (potassium hydroxide) examination of skin done to confirm the diagnosis of fungal infection. 2. Do not apply antifungal cream before you give a sample for KOH examination. 3.

It most commonly affects areas like groins and armpits. Both scaly white and moist itchy lesions can occur. Sometimes, hypersensitivity lesions may also be seen along with fungal infection. 1.

It might be worth noting that I have also been feeling dizzy all week but this was before the seizure occurred and has now gone away.","Doctor":"Hi. Your description of the episode is typical of partial seizure. It is likely to be complex partial seizures because of the deja vu (already experienced feeling) and memory loss. Since you are having recurrent seizures, you are suffering from epilepsy. It needs to be investigated and you need to be started on an antiepileptic drug. Antiepileptic medicines like Oxcarbazepine dose of 10-15 mg/kg in two divided doses and Clobazam 5-10 mg, once a day are reasonable for first line medicine for complex partial epilepsy considering your age and gender.

I was put on Pred Forte. After 20 days of which only occasional AC cells were seen in right eye with no flare. Left eye was clear, but few mid vitreous cells were seen which were not present before. Hence, I was still on Pred Forte 2 times a day. A month back few vitreous cells were seen in right and left eye with no vitritis, no intraocular infection and no AC inflammation.

I decided to scratch and a bump appeared. When I woke up this morning I noticed that it was still itchy but the bump was there anymore. I reached the back to feel it, but it felt a little wet as if it popped. I do not know what happened while I was sleeping. Can you please tell me what this is?

It is at the top of your butt crack and the skin appears dry. I do not see any pus. This is unlikely to be due to herpes. It can be due to irritant dermatitis or dryness causing dermatitis or any insect bite if pain also present. Please clean the area with warm water twice daily. Apply topical Eumosone (Clobetasone) cream twice daily. Take antihistamine like Cetirizine. You can get back if it does not subside or any new lesions develop anywhere else."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I am suffering from anxiety. Please help.","Doctor":"Hi. Your description of symptoms is concise and specific, which makes it easy to diagnose your condition. Mental illnesses are broadly classified into neurosis and psychosis. In neurosis, a person does not lose contact with reality and understands that he has a mental issue known as insight into illness. The person is concerned about it and actively seeks help, just like you. All anxiety disorders fall under neurosis. Conversely, in psychosis, a patient losses contact with reality for example false perception like voices talking or false belief like a delusion that people are planning to kill him. These patients refuse to believe that they have a mental problem and they resist any sort of treatment. Schizophrenia is a classic example of psychosis. Patients of neurosis do not convert into psychosis. Anxiety remains as anxiety no matter how severe or chronic it is. So, be assured that you are not going to become schizophrenic, lose your mind or land in a mental hospital. Anxiety disorder has multiple presentations like generalized anxiety disorder, panic disorder, obsessive compulsive disorder, social anxiety disorder, etc. Depersonalization also occurs in anxiety disorder. Frequently, these conditions coexist in varying severities at different points of time. Your description suggests that at a certain level, you realize that your fear is irrational, but you still cannot get it out of your mind. This is likely to be an obsessive thought. The characteristics of an obsessive thought are :- Despite this, you are unable to kick it out of your mind or prevent thinking about it. There is a proven helpful way of dealing with an obsessive thought. Try a deep breathing technique like the 4-7-8 technique (relaxed breathing) which you can find on the internet and use it whenever you feel more anxious. Lastly, if you feel the need of taking medicine to deal with it, you should choose an antianxiety drug like Clomipramine or Fluvoxamine which has proven efficacy against obsessive symptoms as well.

She is having a peculiar pain for the past six to eight months. The pain is located just above the left ear and 2 cm beside the left eye. Earlier, the pain use to occur once in one to two months. Usual timing for this pain is bedtime during nights around 10 to 11 PM. The pain will last for just 5 to 10 minutes. She kept ignoring it by assuming as a normal headache. Slowly the frequency of this pain increased to once in every 15 to 20 days. This went on to reach once in every two to three days during last month. We were to go on an urgent trip to hometown; therefore we thought to postpone the checkup till the return from the trip. During the hometown trip, we discussed with a known neuro doctor, who got her head CT done. CT report is absolutely normal and he suggested that my wife should not take much tension. For past one week, the frequency of the pain increased to two to three times in a day. At times she had some kind of pain with her left ear in the past. But that is not affecting her now. Currently, the timing of the pain is not fixed and the same happens at any point of time. Usually it lasts for approximately 15-20 minutes. Since the CT scan report of the head is absolutely normal, we are not able to figure out the real reason for this pain. What could be the possible reason for this pain? Can I get the detailed response? She is also having very minor increase in thyroid level. However, as per experts the current level does not require any medication. I am attaching the CT report as well as the recent thyroid report. Apart from this, she does not have any other significant symptom. I am looking forward to your response.","Doctor":"Hi.

In a lot of patients with diabetes and hypertension, the main reason for poor erection is poor blood pressure and sugar control. If your blood sugar levels are not in the normal range then please get the levels in the normal range. HbA1c should be tested in your case. If the levels are normal then no need to worry. HbA1c levels tell about the long-term blood sugar control. To get a strong and hard erection, you can think of using tablet Udenafil 50 mg tablets.

I am married with a daughter. I had a hysterectomy operation. I am hypertensive and was on Asomex 2.5 mg for the last three years. But taking Asomex 2.5 mg, my BP level fluctuated and sometimes it even increased to about 170/90. I am unable to take Asomex 5 mg as it leads to swelling of my legs and frequent urination. I am on service so on telling my doctor he reduced the dosage to Asomex 2.5 mg. Two months back, I was having a little discomfort and even experiencing pain on the left side of my chest. On monitoring, my BP at my Omron digital BP machine my BP came out to be 180/102. So on the next day, I immediately consulted a general physician and he prescribed me two drugs. Olmezest CH 40 to be taken in the morning and Asomex 2.5 mg to be taken at night or Asomex 1.25 mg if the BP goes below 120/80. I started taking these two drugs from the next day and even regularly monitored my BP using Omron digital BP machine. After 20 days of regularly taking these drugs my BP came down to 123/78, so I took Olmezest CH 40 in the morning and Asomex 1.25 at night and continued this medication for one month. A week ago I was feeling quite weak and on monitoring my BP I saw my BP came down to 90/60. So, now I have stopped taking Olmezest CH40 for the last six days and now I am only taking Asomex 2.5 mg. Today in the morning my BP was 118/70 and my pulse level was 73. Is it safe to stop Olmezest CH 40 like this? What hypertensive drugs can I take and in what dose to stop my BP level fluctuating in this manner?","Doctor":"Hello. You may stop Olmezest if BP falls. You will likely need another antihypertensive along with Asomex 2.5 which is not enough for you and we will not be able to increase it due to side effects. Olmezest takes some time for its full action so when it achieves its full action, it leads to hypotension. So, you will likely need 20 mg of plain Olmezest instead of Olmezest CH 40 which contains two antihypertensives. So, in my opinion, you should continue to monitor your BP regularly, ideally thrice a day for one to two weeks till medicine dosage are optimized. And as soon BP starts rising above 135 to 140 systolic, you should start plain Olmezest 20 mg once a day in the morning. This will help in preventing the future episode of accelerated hypertension. Also, continue with a low salt diet, regular exercises. Hope this helps you and get back if you have any doubts."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I am a 65 year old male. Before 12 years, I went for my first master checkup without symptoms. The result showed high 2 hours PPBG while FBG and A1c are normal. The consultant physician advised me to eat less at a time and increase the number of feeds in a day and encouraged me to check BG level once in every three months. Accordingly, I have done the tests both at home and labs every three months. My FBG is always normal that is 80 to 85 (rarely crosses 100 but within 105). My A1c is also quite normal of around 4.2 to 5.4. However, my PP (2 hours) is always in the range of 150 to 176. However, when I take reading after three hours of ingestion, the PP value is in the normal range 120 to 140. I do not take any medicine or Insulin. I have no symptoms like frequent urination or too much thirsty and head reeling. Nevertheless, a few months ago, I suddenly developed tinnitus in both my ears. MRI was taken and found normal. My hearing is excellent. Meniere's disease is ruled out. The volume in left ear is more than right ear (Left 6/10 whereas right 3/10). It is the insect cricket's sound.Last week, while I was working on my computer sitting in my usual chair, I developed a catching sensation on both my calves all of a sudden. A bit burning sensation in the calves also felt. It continues. I walk without any difficulty and do the routine. No tickling or pinning sensation. I am in a remote village spending my post retirement with family. My wife being a clinical biochemist advised me to rule out peripheral neuropathy as my 2 hour PP test is always in the range of 150 to 176. I also have a mild pulling sensation at the back of my right thigh. Hence, I request you to suggest tests find out the cause of the problem.Yesterday, my blood sugar levels were FBG 80, PP 176 ( 2 hours after BF bread upma, a teaspoon of ghee and tea with milk) and PP after 3 hours it is 106 (nothing was eaten in between) and randomly done at 7 PM before dinner was 108. Today, my blood sugar levels are as follows: FBG 80, PP 174 (2 hours after BF that contained one full banana, cornflakes, milk and one and a half cups of tea with milk) and 2 hours after lunch 178 (that included one whole banana, 4 pieces of papaya, rice, cabbage, rasam and sambar, buttermilk, one teaspoon of ghee).My BP is always 110/70 mmHg or 120/80 mmHg. I generally walk 2 km a day. I do not smoke or drink alcohol, and I am a vegetarian. Lipid did a month ago, and it was quite normal. It may be helpful to mention my total cholesterol, and LDL counts are always low (120 and 45 respectively) for several years now. I weigh 67 kg, and my height is 171 cm. Thank you.","Doctor":"Hello. On going through the details provided, it is clear that you are in a prediabetes situation. Following are the criteria for diagnosing diabetes: Considering this, currently, there is no diabetes. You can prevent it from progressing it to diabetes by adopting a modified lifestyle, which includes properly planned balanced diet, with restricted caloric intake, regular exercise for at least 1 hour a day. Brisk walking is a good option. Avoid sweets, deep fried foods, pastries, other bakery items, foods made out of maida, sweetened aerated drinks (colas), sweet corn syrup containing food products, red meat and high-fat dairy. Also, better to refrain from alcohol and smoking. As regards the sound in the ear (tinnitus), there is hardly any treatment. If it is not really disturbing, then better ignore it. As regards sudden catch in the calf muscle, these are cramps, which may occur due to lack of vitamin D3, calcium and sodium. To see if there is any neuropathy, a test with biothesiometer can be done to see there any affection. Presently, there is absolutely no need for taking any drug. Your blood pressure and lipid profile are quite good. If you have any doubts please do come back, I will be glad to clarify. Biothesiometer test may be done to see if there is any affection to peripheral nerve sensation. Restricted diet and regular exercise for over one hour every day.

Acne is very common in one's teens and twenties. Some continue to have breakouts even later in their life especially if there are some underlying hormonal issues or genetic predisposition. Pimples develop because of increased sebum secretion, inflammation, and bacteria residing on the skin called P. acnes has an important role to play. Treatment requires knowing your detailed history, any hormonal issues, any treatments you have taken in the past, products you use on your face, etc. Oral medicines and creams/gels are used for the treatment of acne. For mild eruptions, creams containing Clindamycin and Nicotinamide may be used. Benzoyl peroxide and Adapalene are other commonly prescribed anti-acne applications. But it is important to discuss with a dermatologist to decide on the correct line of treatment. Meanwhile, eat healthily, avoid excess milk and dairy, chocolates, and junk food. Exercise regularly and sleep well. Also, avoid using oil or greasy applications on the scalp and face and keep cosmetic use to a minimum.

The average size of the penis after erection should be between four to six inches approximately. So your size falls within the normal range. As far as your query is concerned about increasing the size of the penis, then it is not possible to increase size because the penis is not a muscle.

My abdomen is sore to touch for about two months. It is sore to the touch at the top of my abdomen below my sternum, and on the far left about an inch up from where my belly button would be. I went to a minor emergency about a week in, and I was told I most likely had gastroenteritis. I went to my primary care physician a few days later and got put on Omeprazole. I took it for about a month and went back to my PCP, and was then sent in for an ultrasound. Nothing serious was found with the ultrasound. Does this sound like a dietary service or something more serious?","Doctor":"Hello. Sore to touch abdomen for the last two months can be indicative of a few things. It can be gastritis, ulcer related pain, pain related to kidneys, and can also involve the renal tract. Do you have any fever? Does the pain change or subside after food? Do you have any acidity or digestion problems? Mostly if it was related to gastritis or ulcer, it can be due to improper diet and ulcer pain. However, you have taken Omeprazole and if it is not subsiding then that can be ruled out. If ultrasound is not conclusive, I will advise you to get a CT (computed tomography) scan of the whole abdomen done. Until then I will advise the following medicines: Ibuprofen 400 mg up to twice daily for three days after food (to rule out muscular pain, if the pain subsides you can stop after a few days), Omeprazole 20 mg once in the morning before breakfast for another five days. Syrup Sucralfate two teaspoons twice daily after food for another five days. Please give me a detailed dietary history and your food habits."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, My mother is 65 years old. She is diagnosed with stomach cancer stage 4. We consulted the situation with five top oncologists and based on their suggestions we decided not to put her under chemotherapy. We are keeping her under supportive care at home. She is not taking any medicine for cancer as of today. The current concern is that she is 45 kg in weight and is able to take only liquid food since diagnosis. She does take semi-solid (mashed) food sometimes but it maybe twice or thrice in a week. As you can see in her PET scan attached, the tumor may be causing physical obstruction for the food to pass from stomach to the path down and also from time to time she feels some liquid with stale smell raising up her stomach. She wants to eat but unable to do so because of this weird nausea-like feeling. Can you please suggest some medications to overcome the above problem? Or is there any other way she could be given enough nutrition to manage the situation? Looking for your help at the earliest possible.","Doctor":"Hello. I have gone through her reports. (attachment removed to protect patient identity).  As per the above reports, it looks like metastatic stage 4 gastric cancer. And as I can gather from history above, the decision of supportive care only without any chemotherapy is taken. For gastric cancer, surgery remains the best palliative treatment specially if there are features of obstruction as seen in her case. But usually, surgery is not preferred in view of its invasive nature. Her symptoms can be explained by moderate luminal obstruction of the stomach. In that case, another option is to go ahead with percutaneous jejunostomy for feeding which bypasses the stomach and helps in maintaining nutrition. If such a facility is not available then an endoscopic feeding jejunostomy tube can be tried. Sadly only medications such as antinausea drugs will not help much as the problem is due to mechanical obstruction. I hope this helps."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I was on 0.5 mg Xanax for one month. As per my psychiatrist, I went cold turkey from the dose. After eight days I started having mild hallucinations such as a knock on the door, smells, and visual disturbances. I went back to 0.25 mg (on day 10). Will the hallucinations stop if I continue on the 0.25 mg and how slow of a taper should I do from 0.25 mg? I am sensitive to medication changes. I am on Lexapro 10 mg and Trazadone 150 mg.","Doctor":"Hello. I can understand your concern related to Xanax (Alprazolam). Usually, Xanax has a half-life of around 12 hours and is fully eliminated from the body in about four days. You may be well aware that Xanax is a habit-forming drug and is meant to be taken only for a short period. Thankfully, you have only been on a lower dose of Xanax 0.5 mg for a month. So there is a less chance of dependence and withdrawal effects are less likely. So your psychiatrist's initial suggestion of stopping Xanax was a safe tapering plan. I understand that you are now back on Xanax 0.25 mg after ten days due to having mild hallucinatory experiences. How long have you been taking Xanax 0.25 mg? Are you taking Xanax 0.25 mg once daily or more than once daily? If you are on Xanax 0.25 mg once daily, it can be stopped straightaway. Withdrawal effects are less likely on this small dose. If hallucinatory experiences and anxiety are excessive you can consider taking Xanax 0.25 mg occasionally as needed, but not more than once a day for up to a week and then stop it. Long term usage will not be helpful and can be counter-productive. Lexapro (Escitalopram) 10 mg and Trazadone 150 mg are effective antidepressant medications useful in managing anxiety and depression and can be continued on a longer term. If you are having any residual symptoms, you can consider psychological therapy like CBT (cognitive behavioral therapy). You can also try deep breathing and progressive muscle relaxation exercises. If you are feeling physically unwell when Xanax is stopped, consult your doctor for monitoring and support. I hope this helps."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor,I am just wondering what is abutting and abutment of the nerve root means in a back issue. Please explain.

Our family friend suggested me to consume Kalarchikai medicine, powdered mixed with pepper and honey to have it for one mandalam (48 days). I have completed nearly 44 days by consuming one small ball of the mixture every morning and before two weeks I got my periods. Then I had checked whether the cysts were dissolved by having an abdomen scan. But still, small multiple follicules have been seen in it with both ovaries enlarged. Kindly suggest me what I can do further. I got married before one and a half years and I am much worried about my pregnancy. I have gallstones as well.","Doctor":"Hello. I just read your query. See Kalarachi Kai choornam is helpful in amenorrhea. As far as small cysts are concerned they are unmatured eggs which failed to induce menstrual cycle previously, as a result, they got collected in the ovary and they will remain in the ovary. Now, you have got your periods you can start trying for conception. But I advise you to do it under the supervision of a nearby gynecologist because egg size is important while conception and that you can know by ovulation study. Ovulation study is performed under the supervision of a gynecologist. For gall stones, surgical intervention is required generally. Medicine is not of much help."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am a 31-year-old male who until recently weighed about 100 kg. For the last six months to a year, I was obsessively performing a Valsalva maneuver because I had health anxiety and OCD and I was worried about an operation. When I was younger I could have impacted my continence. I have been having some GI issues lately and read that you can cause a hiatal hernia from chronic straining. Is it possible that I could have caused a hiatal hernia at my age? Are six months to a year chronic enough? If I have caused a hiatal hernia will it stay forever? Or can I reduce it and the hernia size through exercise to tone and strengthen the diaphragm and weight loss? I am extremely worried I have caused a hernia and will have to live with it forever. I have had a standard x-ray of the chest which came back normal. Could a hernia have been missed?","Doctor":"Hello. I can very well understand your concern and at the start, I want to tell you that chronic straining does not lead to the development of hiatus hernia, however, your weight can. Hiatus hernia is an anatomical change that can present since birth, and after certain surgical procedures over abdomen or diaphragm, overweight to obese can develop hiatus hernia because of the excessive pressure over the stomach from belly fat, causing upward lifting of the lower part of food pipe and formation of hernia. And lastly, due to the old age when the diaphragmatic muscle gets weakened allowing part of the lower esophagus to get pulled in the lower part of the chest. In a young healthy people, diaphragmatic muscle is strong enough to prevent this from happening. Valsalva maneuver if performed vigorously can cause tears in the lower part of the esophagus which is an acute complication of this, but it will not alter the anatomy or produce a hiatus hernia. Valsalva can harm somebody if it is done without a reason (there are certain indications for medical conditions), but it can only cause damage to the lower part of the esophagus acutely but would not alter the anatomy of it i.e. hiatus hernia. Yes, an x-ray plain without contrast can easily miss a hiatus hernia. A special x-ray with contrast named barium is swallowed, and serial x-ray images from the chest are taken, that can diagnose the hiatus hernia instantly, however, a plain chest x-ray cannot detect the presence of hiatus hernia. So now coming to your second concern that you have to live with it. Well, it is not yet proven that you have a hiatus hernia, secondly, it is not uncommon to have hiatus hernia in people without any symptoms and it can remain undiagnosed until their whole life. The point is it can present harmlessly in human for years and years and does not necessitate any investigations. The time to develop a hiatus hernia is variable but it does take many years of overweight to cause hiatus hernia (very less likely within 6 to 12 months time). It is not a rule that every hiatus hernia would cause symptoms or disease or any complications. I would not suggest you even to worry about it and get tested for it. Because it would not change anything for you. Simple exercises, keeping a healthy lifestyle, reduce weight are all that is required. The weight loss is very compulsory, this will not only help you preventing hiatus hernia but also other things like gastroesophageal reflux (GERD), bloating, gas distention, constipation. I hope this helps. Overweight. Barium swallow if worried about it, or have symptoms suggestive of gastroesophageal reflux. Weight reduction. Follow up to discuss if any concern."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, During masturbation I just rub the tip of the penis and not the entire penis. Is it a wrong way of doing?

Can it be vestibular schwannoma? Or something else in some cranial nerves or near the brain stem. In the second picture that is highlighted what can this white cluster shaped thing be? I have got a few symptoms. For the past three months, I have had tingling and needle sensation starting from the right eyebrow then radiating towards the left side and the entire forehead and right eyelid and sometimes even towards the tip of the nose. The sensation never stops no matter what I do. I feel dizzy all the time like if I am on a boat. When I tilt my head and move it gets even worse and starts spinning. I have a hard time looking at an object and cannot focus. My left eye is getting blood red whenever I look at a screen. My doctor prescribed Cortisone tablets that did not help. My left ear feels clogged and my hearing on that ear is reduced too. I also have tinnitus lately on the same ear. Doctors at first thought it was due to B12 or Iron deficiency but both are at normal range. My blood pressure is normal too.

There are less changes of vestibular schwannoma in the area. There are no other lesions in the brain."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am a young female who recently developed a rash on my left thigh. It was very painful and looked very similar to a shingles rash. So I went to urgent care to be examined and they performed a culture swab. My relationship status is that I live now with my ex-boyfriend and he was the only male I was with for the past three years. We had a make-up relation session last night, and this morning the urgent care informed me the culture swab came back positive for herpes simplex 2. I am quite confused as to why there is only one lesion present and it is nowhere near my genital area? I have not had any abnormalities in my genital area, nor any difference in urinary tract issues or anal abnormalities. Should I be taking regular precautions as if I had genital herpes? Should my ex-boyfriend go and get tested? Also, is there a chance that the swab's results were incorrect? Can I expect to eventually have genital symptoms? I am so lost and scared and the urgent care facility is not helping with my concerns. Please help me.","Doctor":"Hello. I understand your concern. Genital herpes normally presents with the lesions or the cold sores as you mentioned, and the rash can be a very atypical presentation which is also rare. It is mostly the cold sores, and the mucosal lesions, which ultimately crusts and heals on its own. The issue is that a lot of times herpes can be acquired and the symptoms will not be manifested for a long time in people with good immunity. Since you have been with your partner for thee years, without any other sexual exposure, it is better that he gets tested and rules out herpes too. As I said, it can be asymptomatic and it is better to know the status.  Normally herpes tests are highly sensitive and 95 % of the time they are right. But I will still suggest you get yourself re-evaluated for herpes and other STDs like chlamydia. If a positive result comes up once again, with appropriate treatment of Acyclovir, the outbreaks can be reduced to a large extent. I hope this helps."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, A few days ago I jumped off a gate that was about 10 feet tall. Upon landing, I landed flat on my feet, a surge of excruciating pain took over my feet. Since then, I have trouble walking and the pain has not yet subsided. Though it hurts a lot when I am walking and putting pressure on my feet when I am in a resting position they do not hurt much. I was unable to walk the next day but a day after I was able to start walking. I am having semester and having a lot of work to do. I may have pushed my feet further and both of my feet of purple bruises on them around the arches of my feet as well as the inner heel. I went to see a doctor yesterday and he said that if I had a broken bone that I would be screaming every time I tried to walk or touch my feet. He said that I likely have muscle contusions and the pain is due to the immediate shock in foot muscles while landing. I have been trying to walk on the outer sides of my feet when I need but I am trying to stay grounded as much as possible. Is there any chance the doctor may have missed something? What should I do? My classes are starting shortly and I am worried that getting around is going to be a major challenge for me.","Doctor":"Hi. Without examining you it is very difficult to be precise but I can say with confidence that you have a significant injury as bruising is a hallmark of either a fracture or a significant soft tissue trauma. Weight-bearing is the second thing we look at and if you cannot bear full weight with your foot flat and walk at least five to seven steps, then again you need to be cautious. Thirdly, if you have pain at a localized area rather than over a large area then again it is an indication for an x-ray. Looks like you need an x-ray. Not only will it rule out a fracture but also if you have no fracture but have the above symptoms then you need to look after yourself as some times the soft tissues take longer to heal than bony injuries. Also, sometimes you may need an MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) to be absolutely sure. I hope this helps."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I and my partner had sex yesterday. We were using condoms but he had changed the condom three times already. On the last one, he took it out because he felt like he needed to ejaculate but it went away after he had pulled out. He then asked me to masturbate him and he ejaculated a little not even a lot. So I realized that the tip of the condom was ripped. I was scared of what if his precum went inside me. He says no but most guys does not even feel when their fluid comes out. I was ovulating last week I do not know if I should take plan b pill or not? I am also scared of the side affects.","Doctor":"Hello. You are right to state that if the condom was torn, there may have been some precum gone inside the vagina and even that can make you pregnant unless your partner is absolutely sure about it. You can choose to take the emergency contraceptive pill within 72 hours of intercourse. It would cause bleeding in the next five to seven days and may be even scanty to heavy. That should prevent any implantation and prevent fertilization by increasing the tubal motility. If you are not sure then you may consider this method of contraception. Side effects may differ in different users from headache, dizziness to nausea and delayed periods in the next cycle with heavy flow. You may choose not to use it. Ideally speaking the chances are getting pregnant cannot be ascertained or quantified as you are not sure about the ejaculate. If you want you can wait till your next periods and if you miss them by seven days, then you can do a pregnancy test done to affirm or neglect the pregnancy. And if positive then safe termination by the medical method can be opted under specialist supervision."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I have negative HIV, ELISA test on 54th day, 108th day, 210th day and 260th days. May be all tests are second or third generation tests. I also have done an HIV test with the help of home test kit which shows result in 10 minutes. The result is negative. My questions are what are the chances of a false negative? Whether I need anymore testing like PCR, RNA/DNA test? Does three months HIV test is considered conclusive? What are the chances of transmission in case of protected sex (no anal or oral sex)? Whether deep kiss or smooch can transmit the virus?","Doctor":"Hi. I will answer your query specifically. In your case, the chances of false negative are almost nil. Chances of false negative are high during the window period which extends from three weeks to six months. Usually, a person having HIV has detectable antibody levels by a month. Almost 97 percent of people become seropositive by three months. By six months any person having HIV will develop antibodies. Only a few cases have been reported where seroconversion occurred late after a year. As you have done your tests at monthly intervals till six months and the results have been negative, chances of it being false negative are almost negligible. You do not need any other tests. We consider three months as conclusive but prefer to do a test at six months too. If you have used a condom, you need not worry. If only sex is unprotected chances of spreading through single contact are 0-1%. Kissing does not spread infection. I hope this helps."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I would like to ask what is the likelihood that my partner who performs oral sex on me has trench mouth or acute necrotizing ulcerative gingivitis? He has no bad breath and he was able to have normal food. Can people with trench mouth have no bad breath and is able to eat normal food?","Doctor":"Hello. I understand your concern. Trench mouth or acute necrotizing ulcerative gingivitis (ANUG) is a bacterial infection and is uncommon nowadays but it is highly associated with HIV infection and in kids with nutritional deficiencies. To be diagnosed with trench mouth or ANUG, symptoms like gum necrosis and ulceration, pain and bleeding (on just touching the gums) should be present. The main characteristic feature is fetid or the putrid odor which is caused due to the rotting gum tissue. And people diagnosed with ANUG has this odor, unless if they are under treatment in a very initial stage. It is certainly difficult for people with ANUG to eat a portion of normal or even less spicy food if they are not under treatment. It is treatable within a week by the usual antibiotic regimen and medicated mouth rinses. Gum infection such as this cannot occur only by fellatio. If your partner is diagnosed with immunocompromised diseases, respiratory infection, poor nutrition or has the habit of smoking, practice caution during the act. Proper protection and oral hygiene practices will prevent such infections. I hope this helps."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am a 30-year-old female. My main problem in life seems to be way too much anxiety. That is the main reason I went to the doctor to get a blood test. I got my blood and urine tests reports and these are the things that I think should be noted. Good LDL cholesterol: 106 mg/dl (should be under 130). Good HDL cholesterol: 77 (should be over 40). Low triglycerides 33 mg/dl (should be between 35-149). Normal HbA1C 5.3 % (should be between 4.5-6.2). A bit high average blood glucose 105 mg/dL (should be between 70-100). For my urine test, there was a trace of leukocytes and many bacteria. My blood urea nitrogen (BUN) was a bit low 6 (should be between 7-22). Everything else came out in normal ranges. My question is, could I possibly have adrenal fatigue from my high anxiety and stress levels all the time? With the research I have done so far, my body seems to have been in some sort of infection, but I have not been sick, but I have felt like I was about to get sick about three times in the last month. So I am not sure, but my kidneys may not be working properly, and could not this also be caused by too much anxiety? I may have a thyroid problem because of the low triglycerides. It is either hyperthyroidism or malnutrition, my body is not able to absorb or process nutrients properly. I do not eat a low-fat diet. If I have hyperthyroidism, I do not want to treat the thyroid to mask the symptoms, I want to get rid of the cause. So if the cause of my thyroid problem is anxiety (and all the other health problems I have), would not it be better to treat the actual cause, rather than the symptoms? It also looks like my body is not able to process sugar properly (I have semi-high blood glucose, but basically perfect cholesterol levels). Could this all be a result of my high anxiety, causing physical problems in my body? I prefer to go a natural route to solve my problems. I have heard that taking GABA supplements could lower anxiety levels. However, at this point, I am also open to a prescription form of anti-anxiety medication if necessary. I do not want to take anything to mask my problems. If I take any medicine, I want it to solve my problem. What I could do about it?","Doctor":"Hello. First of all, your reports are all normal except for some infection in the urine. For that, I advise a test called urine culture sensitivity and revert back with the report. Your triglyceride is slightly low. That does not mean anything. It does not mean you have a problem in absorption or malnutrition or hyperthyroidism.Even your HbA1c (glycated hemoglobin) is within the normal limits. So there is no problem in sugar metabolism. Now coming to your query adrenal fatigue, no it does not happen due to excess stress or anxiety. Our body is capable of handing 1000 times the normal stress level. So just relax. I feel there is no problem in your body but there are some psychological issues that might be the cause of your stress and anxiety which need to be addressed. I advise you to consult a psychiatrist for that. I do not think any dietary supplement can help in stress. I advise you to learn yoga and meditation. That will help you a lot. You can also start taking tablet Nexito (Escitalopram) 5 mg every night until you meet your psychiatrist."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, Four months before I found that I have thyroid with high TSH 18. Then I put off some weight and did morning walk and running, then it decreases to 14. Now I left the exercise because I met with an accident. Now I have done my test again it was 18 again. Now I consulted the doctor but he said that I have to take medicines lifelong. It was really shocking for me and he prescribed me Thyrox 50 mg and Pure D3 60000 iu for four weeks and Rabeprazole 20 mg. But I am nervous and confused about taking this drug because I read somewhere that once you started taking this drug it will replace your thyroid hormones. Then you have to take the medicines life long. My weight is 80 kg, BP 110/180 mmHg, T3-0.98, T4-7.62 and TSH 15.98. Now kindly suggest me what should I do? Is it necessary to take the drug or is there any alternative? Please help.","Doctor":"Hello. First of all, you must have to understand the problem. You are suffering from medical condition called hypothyroidism. In this condition, the thyroid hormone production decreases. Thyroid hormone is necessary for the metabolism of the body and in the absence of this hormone body metabolic rate reduces and the person starts gaining weight. When thyroxine hormone decreases, TSH (thyroid-stimulating hormone) increases which trigger the thyroid gland to produce more thyroid hormone (T3, T4), and raised TSH level in the blood is a diagnostic factor, this is raised in your case. Management: We have to give thyroid hormone preparation in the form of thyroxine which comes under various brand names like Thyrox and this is necessary for body metabolism. Otherwise, you will have to suffer from some other medical problems, so it is advisable to continue this medicine as advised by your doctor until your TSH level become normal. Then you can again consult your treating doctor or us for further plans until then you must take it. Frankly speaking, there is no alternative to this. Here I noticed that your BP (blood pressure) is 110/180 mmHg. It is surprising that the diastolic is more than systolic. I think there is some typing error so again check your BP and tell, as this is suggestive of that you are hypertensive too, so you must start some anti-hypertensive medications. Rabeprazole is medicine for hyper-acidity. Advise: Weight reduction and salt restriction."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I took a tablet to extend my period during my wedding. After that, I got a scanty one in the same month and took an i-pill end the end of the month. I got my next period within a few days. It was heavy for the first two days and I felt so tired. Again after twelve days, I had bleeding for four days. The next cycle started. I took an i-pill on that month also. Last week I took another i-pill and it started bleeding after four days. It is very heavy. Am I getting an early period or just bleeding or something else?","Doctor":"Hi. You are probably taking the i-pill again and again which is not right. It has caused hormonal imbalance and disturbed the cycles. It is meant to be taken once only for emergency reasons and not after every unprotected sex. Anyhow the reason for bleeding like this is withdrawal after taking an i-pill. If you take the i-pill before ovulation, then your cycle is likely to get shortened and you get your periods early. But if you happen to take it after ovulation, then the cycle will be prolonged. It will be better if you take regular combined contraceptive pills for 21 days if you want contraception for a few months. This will also regularise your cycles and also control bleeding. However, it will be better if you get one check-up done and get a scan done to see is there any other cause for heavy bleeding."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I have a 30 -year-old male.

Symptoms you have mentioned are indicating towards gastritis or acid peptic disease. Still, I need more information. Why you underwent GB (gallbladder) surgery? You did not mention the GI series report, it was before the onset of pain or after the onset of pain? Is there a regurgitation of food or vomiting? If yes are there blood in vomit? These kinds of problem is associated with an excess weight. And it is associated with other problems also e.g. NASH (Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease), metabolic syndrome. Advice. 1. Start on Rabeprazole and Domperidone combination tablet twice a day half an hour before a meal. This will help to alleviate your pain by suppressing acid activity. 2. Take Pepcid (Famotidine) syrup 5 ml along with meals in the initial 10 days of treatment, it will relieve severe pain. 3. Avoid fatty foods. 4. Make a diet chart whatever you are eating in the next seven days, we will modify it. 5. Do exercise to loose weight. Obesity is a known risk factor of these problems and others that I have already mentioned. 6 Get done investigations, CBC (complete blood count), liver function test, lipid profile, fasting and post prandial blood glucose level, and thyroid function tests (T3, T4, TSH).

I had four events during the last six months. I was afraid of herpes, so I went and got a blood PCR HSV test which came negative (this is after my first encounter with pimples and have not had sex ever since). However, my antibody HSV 1 and 2 were positive. Since I did not have any major symptoms I assumed I do not have herpes. About two months ago I started getting a bump in my pubic area that kind of looked like vesicles. It was not painful or itchy and it went away by itself after 10-12 days. However, it left its mark and again two days ago it came back the same kind. About seven days ago I got a pimple on my penis and two small pimples between the penis and the pubic area. They were not painful however, they were extremely itchy. I let them go and they scabbed by themselves. The one on the penis its the same at usual place but this was the first time that it is actually itchy. I feel like every time the symptoms become worst and worst. It was the first time I saw those two small pimples in that area between my penis and the pubic area. I went and did a swap of it and nothing grew on the culture so it was negative for herpes. And now two days ago I got the pimples (vesicles) that I had one and a half months ago. What is wired for me is the bumps on my penis and between my penis and pubic area.

(attachment removed to protect patient identity).  This is a classical herpes genitalis. A positive antibody test for HSV 1 and 2 substantiates that. The virus causing herpes stays dormant in the nerve cells, causing no symptoms. In most people, the virus becomes active from time to time, traveling from the nerve cells to the skin and causing repeated blisters and sores (recurrent outbreaks). Negative blood, PCR (polymerase chain reaction), HSV (herpes simplex virus) tests do not rule out herpes. The gold standard for diagnosing herpes is a test done on a sore (either a viral culture or PCR testing), and not a blood test. I would suggest an oral antiviral Acyclovir Or Famciclovir for the episodes of herpes. However, if you are having frequent recurrences, you may be a candidate for suppressive treatment."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, My mother is 55 years old.

We consulted a doctor and he advised a chest x-ray and ECG both came out normal. On this, he advised DFO gel to be applied. In this period she also experienced weakness and fatigue. After 15 days of initial pain, although her pain was very very low she used to have a slight discomfort while inhaling deep and felt weak. So the doctor suggested to do a CT scan of the chest and advised calcium, and vitamin supplements. Now there is no pain even on pressing and even while inhaling deep. Sometimes when she sleeps on the same side of the chest a very slight discomfort is observed, sometimes at back or some times at below chest rib cage bones. I am also worried as I found out that she has lost 2 kg in the last one month without any change in the diet and more than 5 kg in the last one and a half years. Although her energy levels are almost back to normal. She does feel the heat more than others and her last BP was 130/77 mmHg and her heart rate is 97 bpm. She feels thirsty more nowadays. My questions are, should I get the ct scan done. Is the benefit more than the radiation risk? What should I do for weight loss? Does any further investigation is warranted here? Please reply.","Doctor":"Hello. You have neither mentioned the duration of diabetes, latest fasting, PP (post prandial) blood sugar levels, HbA1c (glycated hemoglobin) value or the latest TSH (thyroid-stimulating hormone) levels. Please furnish the required information, as well as, her BP (blood pressure). Further, the description of chest pain is suggestive of either (a) simple spasm of the muscles between the ribs (which incidentally, would have improved with a short course of muscle relaxants and warranted no further tests, including CT scan). (b) Inflammation of the left lung covering (pleura), which if associated with weight loss and low-grade fever could be tubercular. (c) Coronary heart disease (chest pain associated with weakness and fatigue), particularly in the case of long-standing diabetes. I will therefore strongly recommend that she undergoes either TMT (tread mill stress test) or stress echocardiography to exclude or confirm heart disease. Also, weight loss or gain is a common occurrence in diabetes. Anti-diabetic drug Metformin (M in Jalra M stands for Metformin) reduces body weight. In addition, a successful correction of hypothyroidism leads to weight loss. For her age and height, she is still overweight by 2-3 kg. I would, therefore, recommend the following initial investigations: 1. Ultrasound of the left side of the chest (for detecting the presence of fluid in the pleural cavity). 2. TMT or stress echocardiography to exclude, detect latent underlying heart disease. Lastly, I do not feel the necessity of a CT (computed tomography) scan at this stage. If she still has any chest pain, a short course of five to seven days of tablet Cip-zox (Diclofenac sodium and Paracetamol) one tablet thrice daily after meals would cure her pain, provided it is due to spasm of the chest muscles. Forwarding of the desired reports would certainly help me in reaching a definite conclusion."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am 29 years old. I had practised masturbation for the past 12 years. Initially for 4 to 5 years, I was masturbating for 2 to 3 times a week. For the last 3 years I am a bit in control (used to masturbate 1-2 times a week ). For the past 2 to 3 years I am feeling general weakness all over the body. I am having back pain and mild neck pain for the past four years. I am underweight (55 kg, height 178 cm) and have some digestive issues too (my digestive fire is less). I am about to do marriage in five months. I want to be physically prepared for the marriage and want to regain my lost health due to excessive masturbation. I request you to kindly suggest siddha medicines for improving my sexual health and digestive health.","Doctor":"Hi. Continuous involvement in masturbation leads to some loss of protein (weight loss) as well as general weakness. The body undergoes excess pitham (excess heat at eyes and also on internal organs). We need to correct these two things through the following Siddha drugs. Capsule Rathina purush- one capsule at night after food. Nannari legium - 3 grams (one spoon) morning and one spoon at night before food. Diets : Eat more drug grapes, cashew nuts, banana, fruits, pumpkin juice, pumpkin halwa, buttermilk daily. Oil bath - apply dil oil (nalla ennai) or kumari thailam or karisaalai madakku thailam or santhanaathi thailam 30 minutes before bath. After 30 mintues, take bath. Practice this daily."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I have a pilonidal cyst on tailbone and I would like to ask what are the risks? Success rate? How long do I have to be in the hospital? How long until I can go and work or be my normal self?","Doctor":"Hi. It is very evident from your query that you have got a pilonidal cyst. This condition is mostly common in male sex and more in hairy people. I will ask you a few questions and your co-operation will be invaluable. What is your profession? Do you have to drive for long hours and what is the duration of the swelling? This is very important because this condition is common in drivers. The hair from back or above natal cleft breaks penetrates through the skin causing cyst and it can get infected and cause a pilonidal sinus with serous or pus discharge. Surgery is the treatment. Now I will answer the queries one by one. There is no risk for the surgery as such if you have diabetes, the sugars have to be controlled. You have to make sure that you trim the hair over the anal region as I have already mentioned that it is common in hairy males. So if you do not trim your hair near the anal region it can recur. You should get X-ray sacral region to rule out osteomyelitis. Success rate 70 to 80 % depending on the size. You have to be in the hospital for 3 to 4 days. You can work normally after 7 to 10 days. You have to keep your anal region clean to avoid infection."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am 66 years, 175 cm, 72 kg. I have diabetes from 2009 and hypothyroid from 2011.

My diabetes has been under control by medicines since inception. My BP is 125/82 mmHg. Temperature is 98.0 F. Sometime I feel cold in my toes, even when my feet are sweating. Can you suggest some remedies?","Doctor":"Hi. HbA1c (Glycated hemoglobin) is still on the higher side. It should be below 6 to be normal. Do regular testing of FBS (fasting blood sugar), PPBS (postprandial blood sugar) to monitor the blood sugar levels. Coldness in feet can be due to less blood supply to feet that can happen in case of any clot in blood vessels. Peripheral neuropathy is also common in diabetes which can lead to less sensation in feet. I would suggest you undergo color Doppler leg to rule out any clot. Tablet Gabapentin once daily you can start along with previous medicines."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, About 12 days ago I started getting a raised red rash on my stomach and upper leg/thigh area. Maybe about 15-20 spots on my stomach and same about on my legs each. At first I though it was some from of psoriasis as I have small psoriasis patch on my shins, elbows, and foot. After a couple more days I was getting red spots on my arms. 12 days later I have this red rash all over my body, stomach, breasts, chest, legs upper and lower, pubic area, back, arms, feet, hands, face and scalp. The rash is not blistery or puss filled, they are about the size of a pencil eraser or smaller. There seems to be dry skin on top of the spot, but not scaly dry skin like psoriasis. There has been no change in my diet, bathing habits, cleaners, or degenerates. My husband is not having any similar symptoms, no spots on him at all, so bed bugs and scabies are out. We have a cat, so I have checked him for fleas or ticks and he is clean. Over the last 2 weeks I have been taking epson and oatmeal baths, to try and elevate itch and redness, they rash seems to get swollen after a bath. Nothing seems to be helping this rash go away, I have been drinking only water for the last five days, cut sugar out of my diet as much as I can. I have also been taking Benadryl for the last 5 days as well. I have tried eczema creams, tea tree oil, white vinegar, anything to clear up and treat my rash and nothing is working. I would just like to know what this rash is so I can take the necessary precautions to get rid of it.","Doctor":"Hi. From the description of lesions and pictures attached (attachment removed to proetct patient identity), there could be a few possibilities like eruptive psoriasis, lichen planus, pityriasis rosea, pityriasis lichenoides, etc. As you already have history of psoriasis, eruptive or guttate psoriasis is most likely. It usually presents as numerous rain drop like red lesions covered with mild scales. It is often preceded by sore throat, fever, bacterial infection, any new medicine use, stress, etc. From your side, you should use a good emollient and a mild steroid cream. Also, a consultation with doctor is required for proper clinical examination and prescription. Avoid tea tree oil and vinegar as it may irritate and harm skin."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, My father is 60 years old. He is having a psychological problem of bipolar disorder as termed by his doctor. For the last fifteen days, he is feeling restless all day long. He gets relief when he sleeps. So all the day he sleeps or just layover. He is depressed and does not talk much. He is also diabetic and having high blood pressure but both are under control. His current medication are as follows: Lamex OD 50 one tablet at night. Rexipra 10 one tablet day and night. Zona 0.25 two tablets three times a day. Dimax OD 250 one tablet at night. Along with regular medicines of diabetes and hypertension. These medicines are on for last 15 days, but he is not getting relief from restlessness. Please advise.","Doctor":"Hello. The first thing I like to tell you that as per my knowledge there is no Dimax 250 mg and Lamex 50 mg. I am assuming that Dimax in query stands for Diamox (Acetazolamide) 250 mg and Lamex 50 mg stands for Lamex (Levofloxacin) 500 mg. The problem you described is very much inadequate to make any conclusion, but I will try my best to map out the problem for your father. Feeling restless, feeling depressed and not talking much are indicative of depression. It can be labeled as a bipolar disorder if he has an episode of irritable or elevated mood, decreased need for sleep, over talkativeness, pressure of speech and expansive behavior in the past lasting for at least four days in a single stretch. If he had features of both these things described above at the same time then there is also a possibility of bipolar disorder. I would like to inform you that a pure psychological kind of bipolar disorder is very rare after the age of 50. If his first problem started after 50 years of age then the possibility of organic bipolar disorder is very high when compared to psychological bipolar disorder. The other possibility in his case is delirium. This is a kind of confusional state in which patient has difficulty identifying family members, name and detail of place where they are placed along with disorientation to time leading to the reversal of sleep-wake cycle (sleep in day and remain awake in the night). Many patients with delirium also reports the presence of objects that are not visible to others. The cause of delirium in your father may be preexisting diabetes and hypertension, medication, overt infection or electrolyte disturbance. The third possibility is of stroke as he is having multiple risk factors including age, hypertension and diabetes. At this stage, I have a few suggestions for you. 1. Stop the Zona from today itself. 2. Get his electrolyte done including serum sodium, chloride, magnesium and potassium. If any abnormality found report back with details. 3. If CT scan or MRI not done till date this is high time to get it done. If already done please send the report along with the next query. 4, Do the blood sugar monitoring every four hours. At this moment he needs detailed evaluation along with proper history. For the same, you need to present the other data so a firm conclusion can be made and future management of patient can be decided."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I was suffering from menorrhagia after the birth of my second daughter. I went for medication and presently it is almost under control. I have to take Tranexa two tablets three times daily for the first two days of the menstrual cycle. Suddenly I notice that my hemoglobin has fallen to 7.12 g/dL. I am physically feeling weak and having chest pain (while walking and climbing stairs), swelling of legs, itching and indigestion problem. I consulted a local doctor and they prescribed Autrin twice daily and ZES-30 once daily.","Doctor":"Hello. Since you are 40 years old now and this problem has not suddenly cropped up. You are having menorrhagia (heavy bleeding) from the last 5 years or so, for which you are having 1 gm of Trenaxa to temporarily stop bleeding. That is the reason for anemia, which is low hemoglobin and feeling very weak. But please do not ignore your chest pain and swelling on legs. You need to be thoroughly investigated for this including all routine investigations like CBC (complete blood count), coagulation profile, PTI (prothrombin time test), renal and liver function tests. Above all ECG (electrocardiogram), and ultrasound abdomen to see the cause. Visit a physician and the most worrying thing which I want to rule out is any evidence of thrombo-embolism and DVT (deep vein thrombosis) for which you may be advised Doppler study of vessels of lower limbs. Be in touch and inform the reports if you like."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am 30 years old. I have pain, stiffness and cracking or creaking sound in both the knees and joints. Pain is persisting for 24 hours and there is difficulty in walking. There are some other symptoms apart from pain which I have listed below: Locking of joints and stiffness if I sit in a specific posture for long. Weakness in joints all the time in standing and walking position. I cannot sit down in a squat position due to enormous pain and even if I do I would not be able to stand without any support. Not able to climb up and down the stairs properly. I can only able to bend the right leg knee on the stairs. No history of any injury, but I have bow legs. During a consultation for the same issue, one of the doctor did say that my axis is little twisted and advised to wear a correcting innersole in my shoes, which unfortunately I was not able to wear as no shoe was fitting me after inserting those soles. My height is 5 feet 11 inches and my weight is 80 kg so I am a little overweight but not much. I am not a fitness freak, in fact, I do not do much of exercises and the majority of my time goes sitting in front of my computer owing to my IT profession. Chronology of events: The pain started in my right knee ten months back. The pain was not much at the start and only happened when I used to stand for long. Consulted a couple of doctors who gave certain medicines like Novovartalon and Ccelebrex capsules. The medicines did not help and the situation only deteriorated further. Approximately two months back I played football for a little while and the pain started to occur in the left knee as well after which I again went for a diagnose. This time it was told to me that I have damaged the meniscus and cartilage in both my knees and thus a surgery will be required. I went to another doctor who tried with exercise and medicine Celebrex for three weeks which ended last week without any significant improvement. I am currently living abroad due to my professional assignment. Language is one of the biggest barriers here, therefore I wanted to be sure that is this the only safe and best option before proceeding with any of the surgical solution.","Doctor":"Hello. I have gone through your reports. (attachment removed to protect patient identity).  The main findings of the reports are as follows: Left knee: rupture of anterior horn of medial meniscus and posterior horn of lateral meniscus. Right knee: rupture of posterior horn of medial and lateral meniscus. X-ray of both knees suggest chondromalacia (softening of cartilage) in both knees. To summarize you have meniscal injury in both knees. They are unlikely to develop without prior trauma. And as such, based on the MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) reports both your knees require arthroscopic (key hole surgery) repair of the torn menisci. Non-operative treatment is likely to cause continuous pain on the long-run. Arthroscopic surgery has been associated with good results. However, I would advise you to consult a well trained and experienced knee arthroscopic surgeon for your condition. It is a good sign that the rest of your cartilage are relatively normal in MRI, though the exact picture is likely to be confirmed only during arthroscopy. Unfortunately the images in your rar file did not open up. Kindly send in JPEG format if possible. At present, I would advise you pain killers, relative rest, brace in both knees to prevent further injury to your menisci and cartilage before you plan for surgery."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am a 71-year-old male with h/o HTN and diabetes.

Nephrologist did not prescribe any medicine for that. My general health is good and I walk about 4 km daily. I am planning a week-long vacation to a place which is 10000 feet altitude high. I had been to places that are higher than that height, but I did not stay there for not more than a day. In order to acclimatize to high altitude, I plan to take Lopar SR 250 mg twice a day for three days. Will this help me to stay at 10000 feet for about five days? Are these tablets contra indicated for me? I seek your valued advice in this regard. My wife has COPD, but under control with Seriflo 250 mg rotacaps daily.","Doctor":"Hello. I had a look at your query. And would first like to congratulate you on maintaining controlled sugar and blood pressure. Now I would agree with the entire prescription meant for you. The medicine Lopar (Lorsatan) has some side effects but it is not serious enough to cause trouble within five days. So I do not think you need to worry if you discontinue it in for five to six days. Overall, I think you should be fine. However, I am not sure that the same can be said about your wife. She has COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease). The air in the hills is thin and usually lacking in carbon dioxide that the city air has in abundance. Oxygen is the respiratory trigger for the patients of COPD. So they breathe in when the oxygen content in the body is low. So when the air is thinner with lesser content of oxygen, she may feel breathless. I would suggest that the frequency of Seroflo (Salmeterol and Fluticasone propionate) should be increased. Also, it is better to carry an MDI (metered dose inhaler) inhaler instead of rotacaps. The former is more effective. She can take the MDI at least three to four times daily and also as and when required. I hope this helps."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor,  I am 25 years old.

I do not know what made me think like how humans came to this world, how animals are evolved? Why did I get these thoughts? I started asking people some are like apes, it is God who created if it is God then why this happens? For some reason, my mind was not ready for any answer. If I stick to God, I will be thinking fine, it is God who created man and animals then we found different languages, we made roads, we made money. So I will start thinking from the beginning.

Although it is never possible to make a final diagnosis without interacting with the patient, the available description points toward the possibility of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). The OCD is a type of psychiatric disorder which causes repetitive thought pattern despite the due resistance by the sufferer. If the repetition is not done the person experiences extreme anxiety which forces again to do things or thinks in a particular direction. Although it is one of the psychiatric disorder which needs consistent effort but there are a number of options available for its treatment. Most individuals respond to either medication or ERP (exposure response prevention therapy) a form of psychotherapy. Some of them may need a combined approach when there are severe symptoms. Since it is a treatable disorder it is important to start treatment after talking to your doctor. In case you prefer online consultation you can have one here. I must inform you that personal consultation is better, but if the facilities are not available there is no harm in going for online consultation."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor,I am just wondering what is abutting and abutment of the nerve root means in a back issue.

This case has happened for more than 20 times. Eight months ago I experienced a state of severe fear when I am in a barber shop. While I was getting shaved I started sweating and my heart accelerates. I left the shop before my shaving was over. I went to the hospital the next day and they told me that my BP was high and I need medication to lower it.

But rarely I have this a kind of confusion, on seeing somebody and due to fear of getting their names wrong I moved away from them.

As you are aware that anxiety disorder is characterized by excessive concern about one or another thing. Many of the patients with anxiety problems present with excessive sweating, palpitations or pounding heart and dryness of mouth along with fearfulness or fear of dyeing. As your psychiatrist told you the antidepressant class of medicines are the drug of choice for your problem. Escitalopram is one of the antidepressants which is commonly used for anxiety problem. Ideally, it should be started with 10 mg and should continue with this dose for three to four weeks before increasing the dose to 20 mg per day. During the initial days, it is advisable to prescribe Benzodiazepines group of medicine as Escitalopram takes some time to act. I understand your fear and anxiety but at this moment you need to see a psychiatrist regularly so he can help you to control the progression of anxiety symptoms.

And what is the best method of determining whether or not it is, in fact, Strychnine that I have been ingesting? What kind of symptoms can I expect after long term exposure? Are the symptoms likely to continue after I am no longer exposed? And am I likely to recover?","Doctor":"Hello. What is your age? Since how long have you been ingesting Strychnine? In what form and amount? Though there are one such diagnostic tests available to detect Strychnine poisoning other than typical signs and symptoms like generalized effect of muscles, convulsions, etc. Chemical analysis can be done to reveal the poison.  Yes, continuos use of Strychnine can deposit in the body and can be detected many years after death as well, but not in hair follicles but in the spinal cord. Some amount of Strychnine also gets secreted in milk, saliva, sweat, etc. To know whether it is Strychnine apart from test typical signs and symptoms will conform it. Presence in the body and detection of the same would depend largely on the form of poison consumed. The presence of symptoms must be treated with certain drugs. Long term exposure will cause it to accumulate in the body. I hope this helps."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am having a painless pimple protruding on my penis skin. I am concerned about STD. I carried out blood tests and it shows herpes. Kindly suggest some cream.","Doctor":"Hello. Herpes genitalis usually presents with well-defined erosions or polycyclic lesions. The lesions are usually associated with pain or a burning sensation. Treatment is with oral antivirals. You complain of painless bumps which are unlikely to be herpes. It seems more like it could be viral warts. You may ask me a query along with a clear digital photograph of the lesions for a confirmatory diagnosis."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, My mother is 71 years old. She started having joint and bone pain. She has osteoporosis and she recently took retest last year. Her doctor did some blood tests and then sent her to see both an endocrinologist and a rheumatologist. He thinks it is hyperparathyroid. The rheumatologist gave her a shot for her hip pains and said she had bursitis. She also told my mother to make sure the doctor test her vitamin D levels as this could be the cause. My mom got excited as it did not seem serious. But then the endocrinologist called back and said she has hyperparathyroid and she should consult with a surgeon. I spoke to her primary doctor to ask some questions. Her vitamin D level is 28 and her calcium level is 10.7. From the doctors website information it seems as if she has hyperparathyroidism. However, I have read some conflicting reports and wanted to see if my mom should get a second opinion. It also seems to contradict what the rheumatologist said. My question is do you think she has hyperparathyroidism from the calcium and vitamin D levels? Also, after reading the website, it seems there is quite a lot of variability in the quality of the surgeon. Is this something I should be concerned about? It seems that the surgeon should be able to find the bad hyperparathyroid gland before the surgery?","Doctor":"Hi. Joint pain, bone pain and osteoporosis are very frequently seen in hyperparathyroidism. But the very essential component in the diagnosis of hyperparathyroidism is serum parathormone (PTH) levels which need to be elevated. It can be normal in the case of secondary hyper parathyroidism. So I want to know what is her PTH level. Calcium levels can be normal or elevated in hyperparathyroidism. It is difficult to tell only on reports on calcium and vitamin D levels as calcium levels depend on serum albumin levels also. But I personally feel she has hyperparathyroidism. Now coming to the surgery, hyperparathyroidism can be due to tumors in parathyroid glands which requires surgery but there are other causes of hyperparathyroidism which do not require surgery. Ask your endocrinologist, has he evaluated the cause and then referred to a surgeon? If not I advise you to get nuclear medicine scanning with radiolabeled sestamibi of Parathyroid glands and revert back to me. If you could upload all the reports done till now it would be very helpful and I can advise you even better."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I took an x-ray a few days ago and there is an odd gray mass about the size of a tooth in my gums on the left bottom side. I do not believe. I have been getting discomforts and as a result of that because I am currently getting some pain from my wisdom tooth which is colliding into its neighboring tooth in a slant position. So my dentist wants to send me to a specialist and I am really worried as there is no appointment for a while.","Doctor":"Hello. I believe you are seeing the gray mass in the x-ray and as such you do not have any swelling over the gums which you can visually see. There can be any of the following conditions according to your symptoms: It can be a benign cyst, which usually occurs below the lower wisdom tooth and can be removed by the specialist through a small surgical procedure which will not cause much discomfort to you in the near future. It can sometimes even be after prolonged infection of any teeth like if the wisdom teeth are slightly tilted, it can cause an inter-dental infection resulting in encystment of the infection causing a radiopaque mass seen in the x-ray. It will heal in the long term after using antibiotics for five days at least, else the same above said procedure would be done by the specialist. It can be also a hard tooth-like odontome which is usually benign and should be removed by a specialist as it can in the future sometimes turn malignant too. I hope this helps."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am 59 years old. I was diagnosed with hepatitis C alcoholic cirrhosis, acute pancreatitis and that was almost two years. I am currently taking Levothyroxine 50 mg once daily, Labetalol Hydrochloride 100 mg once daily, Lisinopril 20 mg once daily. I was in the hospital at first to stabilize my condition. My hepatitis C cleared but still of course I cannot change the damage to my liver. I was told I would only be given five to ten years if I would quit drinking. I kind of fell off the wagon about six months ago, about three liters a day. I weigh about 120 kg. I went to my family physician, he ordered a liver profile and complete blood work. I am going to get it done tomorrow, but the only concern I have is this day I have been having not much but had some black stools. Does this mean that my liver is failing? I tried calling my specialist but they had already left their office. Should I go to the ER or just wait till I call my specialists? I quit drinking about a week ago. Can you help me with some advice?","Doctor":"Hello. Black stools are indicative of acute gastrointestinal hemorrhage. Melena or black stools can also turn into a medical emergency if a lot of blood is lost and hence my sincere advice to you would be to go see a doctor as soon as possible. This does not signify liver failure. However, with a history of drinking, the current status of the liver can only be assessed through a liver function test or an ultrasound. But melena does not mean that your liver is failing.  I will advise you on the following until you get to the doctor. Take Omeprazole 20 mg one tablet immediately, followed by one tablet every morning in the empty stomach. Sucralfate syrup two teaspoons immediately, followed by two teaspoons after every meal. This will help in coating the ulcer lining and help in healing. I hope this helps."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, My baby is 2 years 8 months old. His right kidney is enlarged with poor and delayed functioning. I tested DTPA and IVU. It was seen that the left kidney is functioning and the right kidney has obstructive uropathy. My doctor said to get an operation to remove the block in the right Kidney. But my baby has no symptoms, illness. He is totally fine and normal. He is a little baby, What can I do? Please advise.","Doctor":"Hi. I have seen the reports. (attachment removed to protect patient identitiy).  The reports indicate that there was some obstructive uropathy in the right side, that has been corrected. But the DTPA (diethylene triamine penta acetic acid) shows almost equal function of both kidneys, it means functionally the right kidney is also equal to the left. IVU (intra venous renogram) shows obstructive uropathy that has been corrected. The delayed excretion is due to obstruction. For functional status, we see DTPA and not IVU. The second one is for the localization of the obstruction or anatomical abnormalities. So the conclusion is, the scan indicates that functionally both kidneys are equal. We need to do renal function test, blood, urea and creatinine that measures the total function of both the kidneys. The report of the same was not available, I think it must have done and must have reported you if abnormal, I am sure that is normal. Now let us short discussion regarding this case. This obstructive uropathy causes the derangement of kidney function due to pressure effect, this depends on the duration of the abnormality. If damage has occurred that is unlikely to revert back to normal. But further damage can be prevented by an early intervention that has been done in your case. You must remember that some of the normal population is having single kidney with normal life span and life style, many of them not detected during their lifetime. My purpose of this is that it is fine with a single kidney also. Plan for your case: 1. Monitor renal function test every three months if normal or more frequently if abnormal. 2. Monitor growth (height, weight) and other nutritional deficits and get them corrected. 3. Monitor blood pressure once in a month if normal. 4. Monitor DTPA and DMSA (dimercaptosuccinic acid) six-monthly. 5. Keep in touch with your doctor as per his advice. 6. Vaccination against preventable diseases. I am sure that your child will be fine if you follow adequately. Review as per your requirement."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am a male 43-year-old. I have redness on the inside of the penis foreskin and burning sensation on a small part of the penis prepuce.

Doctor suggested to put knee splint for nearly a month, and after that, she went to physiotherapy and her knee is very stiff now. She could not able to bend her knee, and having excess pain. Almost her BP is raising during physiotherapy and the pain stays for a day. Is this normal?","Doctor":"Hello. You have mentioned that your mother had her knee replaced two months ago. I am assuming it is a primary rather than a revision. I will be concerned as much as you are as by six weeks we expect at least a 0 to 90 degree knee bend. By this, we mean that the patient can bend her knee sitting on the edge of the chair and have her foot planted on the ground comfortably. If this is not the case then we need to look at her progress with physiotherapy. If this is slow but steady and the patient is making satisfactory progress weekly and is able to actively participate in the physiotherapy without much post-therapy pain, then I will recommend continuing with physiotherapy but keep a strict eye on the developments and progress. If it is neither i.e. range of motion is less than 0-60 and the patient is struggling with physiotherapy then you seriously need to go and see your surgeon. And I will recommend a MUA (manipulation under anesthesia) which will improve her ROM (range of motion) and make her life with physiotherapy much easier. Also, if you wish you could upload her x-rays post-operatively and a picture showing her ROM and may be I can help ou further and will be able to guide you towards the next steps that you need to take. In the mean time ice the knee after each physiotherapy session."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor,I am just wondering what is abutting and abutment of the nerve root means in a back issue. Please explain.

Our family friend suggested me to consume Kalarchikai medicine, powdered mixed with pepper and honey to have it for one mandalam (48 days). I have completed nearly 44 days by consuming one small ball of the mixture every morning and before two weeks I got my periods. Then I had checked whether the cysts were dissolved by having an abdomen scan. But still, small multiple follicules have been seen in it with both ovaries enlarged. Kindly suggest me what I can do further. I got married before one and a half years and I am much worried about my pregnancy. I have gallstones as well.","Doctor":"Hello. I just read your query. See Kalarachi Kai choornam is helpful in amenorrhea. As far as small cysts are concerned they are unmatured eggs which failed to induce menstrual cycle previously, as a result, they got collected in the ovary and they will remain in the ovary. Now, you have got your periods you can start trying for conception. But I advise you to do it under the supervision of a nearby gynecologist because egg size is important while conception and that you can know by ovulation study. Ovulation study is performed under the supervision of a gynecologist. For gall stones, surgical intervention is required generally.

But two days after intercourse my stomach starts to hurt and I am spotting blood. I have read about spotting to be a sign of pregnancy but after a week after intercourse can it just be my period? My period had to start in nine days, but my periods are irregular. Can they come up to more than a week early or late? Please suggest I do not know what is going on.","Doctor":"Hello,  Welcome to icliniq.com. I have gone through your query with diligence and would like you to know that I am here to help. Based on the information provided, I would like to rightfully start by saying that condoms are 98.9 % effective in preventing conception. The 1.1 % is due to a poorly manufactured condom or due to inadequate care taken to follow the instructions of use. In my opinion, if you followed the instructions of use, there should be nothing to worry about. As for the spotting, this could purely be due to the sexual act itself. Many women have mild spotting after sexual intercourse, some simply due to the excessive contraction and relaxation of the muscles and some due to rough sexual intercourse. As for an implantation bleed, this takes place quite a few days after the sexual act, so it cannot be assumed to be a sign of pregnancy. This, in my opinion, is most probably due to the sexual act itself, or due to an early onset of your period. Wait and watch for a few more days, and if the spotting subsides then this was purely due to the sexual act. If it gets heavier then this is an early-onset period triggered by sexual intercourse. Please also make sure you keep track of your menstrual cycle if at all you do not experience your period now. If there is a delay in your periods, then conduct a home pregnancy test around two weeks after the sexual act and write back to me for further guidance. Do not worry, pregnancy is unlikely. I hope this helps."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I have a strange problem with my hair. 60% of my hair is straight, but the remaining are medium to curly hair. The strange thing is that if I pluck a strand of this new curly hair, the thickness thereof is uneven along the strand, i.e. it starts with a thick hair, after a few millimeters it becomes less thick, then after a few millimeters it becomes thick again and so on until it reaches the end of the hair and rotates on its axis giving the touch aspect curly strand irregularity is noticed. On the other hand, if I pluck a strand of normal thickness it is the same from the root to the tip. What should I do to have hair again all the same thickness along the strand? According to what I searched on the internet, I think I have acquired partial curly hair. I would like to know the causes and what to do about it? I will appreciate in advance for your response.","Doctor":"Hello. I understand your concern. Some people do suffer from this problem. There is no permanent care. However, there are certain options that you can try. Recently liquid keratin treatments are available which has longer-lasting effect and keeps your hair straight for at least 20 hair washes. Any professional hair stylist can guide you about this. There are some good chemical hair straightening creams available, and this gives your hair a fine texture for a long period of time. Again your hair dresser can guide you about how to use it and which one is the best for you (there are some good brands available like Hair straightener or Hair Straight everyday). Try to pick up one with keratin. Even chemical relaxers are useful, however, their effect is very short-lived and I will ask you to avoid it. Do remember that you need to constantly go for such treatment regularly, like monthly once, sadly there is no permanent cure. I hope this helps."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I got MRI of my body done eight years back. The results were good. The radiologist did not find anything clinical relevant. The past three months I suffered from several weird conditions. Ringing in the ears, while the tones shift in frequency (I guess this is not an usual aspect of tinnitus), sometime seeing stars or flashes and headaches. I decided to make a new MRI of my brain, to make sure everything is normal. The new MRI shows some differences compared to the one made earlier. I was pretty shocked when I saw the images. In regard of a second opinion, I would like some more information about abnormalities found in the recent MRI, just to get as much information as possible about my brains health. I would like to ask you a few questions regarding the images from my latest MRI. 1. Could you give your opinion about the images and possible abnormalities? 2. Could you explain about the cortexes where the possible abnormalities are in? 3. Is the area around my mouth or sinuses in the recent MRI looking normal? 4. What is the bright spot in picture 13a? 5. What is the bright straight line at the hight of my nose at picture 11? Cancer appears in the family and I just wanted to be sure. I do not have dental implants. Do you notice anything strange around the mouth area?","Doctor":"Hello.  After having gone through the images, my first message to you is: Nothing to worry (attachment removed to protect patient identity). Absolutely nothing to worry or simply think about. Just wash them out of your mind. All you need to do is lead a healthy life with healthy habits. My findings in your recent MRI: Prominent cisterna magna aka mega cisterna magna, tiny T2-bright spot in the right lentiform nucleus, likely representing an old tiny infarct. Retention cyst in right maxillary sinus. None of these findings have any clinical significance, nor do they have any significant effect on your living or longevity. The old tiny infarct is tiny enough that you never knew that it was there. However, if it were larger, it could have troubled your living, so it is something to remain conscious about. Mega cisterna magna (enlarged CSF space behind cerebellum) occurs in <1% of people and is mostly considered a harmless normal variant. However, people with MCM are often considered to be prone to infarcts, so it would be advisable that you avoid or control other factors that also cause infarcts, especially when there is already an infarct (thankfully tiny, though) like controlling hypertension / diabetes (if you have), avoiding smoking and alcohol, etc. Retention cyst is a fluid-containing pouch that can develop in the nasal sinuses. It is harmless, in fact not worth mentioning. Your mouth and sinuses do look normal, except for the retention cyst in the right maxillary sinus. Unfortunately, none of your files is labeled 13A. However, there is a bright spot - it is the retention cyst in the right maxillary sinus. The bright line is an artifact generated by the machine during imaging or image processing. Regarding your worries over familial cancer, there is nothing your brain MRI to increase your worries. Perhaps regular follow-up is sufficient. I asked about dental implants because without the DICOM images, I was a bit confused whether the bright spot (representing the retention cyst) was in the sinus or in the gums or teeth. Now, I am confirmed that it is in the sinus and your teeth sockets are normal."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I brush two times a day, and also whenever I wake up from small nap, I brush my teeth. But, my mouth smells after 30 minutes of brushing. Please help.","Doctor":"Hello. Start using antibacterial or Chlorhexidine gluconate mouthwash. This is best for bad breath, stinking mouth and halitosis. Use three times a day for two weeks. Another very helpful method for the cure of bad breath is saline water mouth rinses. Take a small cup of lukewarm water and add 1/4th teaspoon of salt in it. Do rinses three times for ten days. This will help. But chronic halitosis or mouth stinking are not a healthy thing. You must get the cause for it identified, whether it is due to any systemic problem like acidity, stomach ulcer, etc., or due to mouth breathing habit or due to poor oral hygiene. Try to fix the problem accordingly first. If you need scaling, get it done and then start with mouth wash or rinses, you will get rid of bad breath for good. Followup after two weeks. Note: Excessive and harsh brushing may damage your teeth. If your oral hygiene is good you need to brush only twice a day with a gentle hand."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor,I am just wondering what is abutting and abutment of the nerve root means in a back issue.

For further information consult a neurologist online -->"},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I am a male, recently 20 years of age. About a year ago I started noticing something weird with my left peripheral vision, although I could not put my finger on it. It was more like a weird sensation. I had just moved to another country at the time, so I can imagine I was quite stressed. As time passed the stress seemed to fade but I had some periods where I felt really distant, and as though my vision was causing it, but I could still not point out anything specifically. I once then went for a relatively intensive jog, and the following day I noticed the first black dot in my vision along with some more not clearly noticeable ones. I called in with the local clinic for blood tests and to check different values with nothing proved to be wrong. A couple of days later, I went out to the park, seeing how doing some activity I usually liked doing, felt. I felt a tremendous \\"low\\" where I felt completely exhausted and everything felt kind of dreamy. The next day I decided I would go visit the clinic again and managed to book with the local university hospital, where I underwent more elaborate testing and even a talk with a psychologist. (I must mention at this point, my main concern was exhaustion, and this distant feeling I was having, not the floaters that started to take shape). I felt no need to continue with the psychologist, and the results turned out with nothing wrong. A couple of more days later I went mountain-hiking with some friends over a weekend, and did not see any more floaters for the duration. But afterwards, getting some proper sleep at home, I noticed a substantial increase of floaters in my vision, as well as the flashes appearing when the floaters pass by light-sources. It is safe to say that was the last time I remember not being bothered by them. From what I can recall, they kept increasing slowly, for about a week before I decided to check with an optician regarding my concern for a torn retina, but no such signs were found. Since this time 4-5 months ago, I cannot really put a finger on if they have continued to increase, but it is not going anywhere either. It has had an huge impact on my daily life and bothers me with lingering thoughts and concerns. I prefer dark surroundings, but when I go out during regular daylight or worse, I can see more floaters than I can count. I have heard they increase with age, but this sudden increase had and still got me worried. They still are not so clear as to obstruct my vision, but passes by my point of focus from time to time. What could the initial cause be? Is there anything I could do to hinder or prevent further development, or even reduce them? Or is these one of those things you just have to live with?","Doctor":"Hello. Floaters are fairly common in the population. They are more common in people having refractive errors like myopia, astigmatism, etc. Since you are having flashes along with floaters, it is good to have a fundus examination of your eyes. I note that you have seen an optician few months ago and nothing signficant was found. If floaters and flashes are persistent, it is better to consult an ophthalmologist for a comprehensive eye examination after dilating your eyes. Conditions like retinal tears, fluid under the retina need to be ruled out. Other conditions like vitreous detachment can cause similar symptoms but they are very rare at your age, usually happens above 40 years. Regarding floaters, your brain will gradually learn to ignore them in your visual field and will become less prominent over time. If floaters are big and obstructing your vision, there are certain procedures like floaters which can break them up and make them less noticeable. Risks vs benefits need to be discussed with ophthalmologist following eye examination."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I had an ultrasound scan of the uterus done in 32nd week of my pregnancy, and the report says the cord is around the neck (type A).

I also have not been getting too much calcium and protein because I have been avoiding dairy products. Should I be drinking more milk and if so, how much?","Doctor":"Hello. Your average expected height is close to 5'6. Best way to help increase height is doing stretching exercises three to four times a week for 20 minutes in a 30 minutes session. You can try Glucosamine for a year but if it is not helping then taking it beyond that may not help. You can try Protein shakes, Calcium 800 to 1000 mg/d and Vitamin D 1000 to 2000 IU/d supplements to avoid the deficiencies.

However, for the past 6 months, my symptoms and use of the medicines has diminished to the point I have not had to take the DDAVP for six months. Etiology unknown as to why I developed DI. Have you ever experienced a person going into remission with DI? Or should I be concerned as I have been having some facial numbs and arm numbness and sometime my equilibrium seems of?","Doctor":"Hello.  It is rare but yes it is possible that over a long period of time, diabetes inspidus can auto correct itself. Over time some, ADH nerve terminals are able to form at the base of the hypothalamus, resulting in the resolution of DI symptoms and the development of an ectopic posterior pituitary. In your case that might be happening and it is a good thing. DI over a period of time is known to cause muscle weakness, and can lead to nerve disorders. I will recommend you to consult a neurologist for your facial numbness, he can perform some tests on you to get the correct picture. Meanwhile you should take a Multivitamin supplement which has Methyl cobalamin and Folic acid (tablet Neurobion Forte once daily for around a month) and check if there is any improvement in your symptoms. It helps in nerve conduction, so might be helpful in your case. Regarding the spontaneous emission, we have to wait and watch. Theoretically as I said it is possible, so hope that is the case for you."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I have eyes flashes for about five years now.

Although I did a lot of tests for retina, what else I can do insted of waiting to see if this problem stops by it self? And I have dryness also.","Doctor":"Hello. Flashes in front of eyes is a classical sign of retinal detachment and posterior vitreous detachment. You should get your retina checked by a vitreo retinal specialist. Since you had trauma near your eye just before these flashes started, there is a strong possibility of posterior vitreous detachment. If your retina is fine maybe it is your brain. But this can be certainly told only by an ophthalmologist. Sometimes during accidents or falls, the occipital lobe (the part where vision center of the brain is lodged) may get injured. Or the optic nerve might be compressing. Again, this can only be told by a thorough examination and head CT (computed tomography) or MRI (magnetic resonance imaging). Flashes in front of eyes is a very important symptom and a dangerous one too, and you should get treatment immediately. Furthermore, if you want a better opinion from me, please follow up with the following details: 1. Spectacles, if any. 2. Previous history of cataract operations. 3. Age.

I had my RF ablation done a 20 days ago and my ectopic, NSVT episodes have come down by 90% and I am feeling healthy generally. I had my echo, ECG, Holter, cardiac MRI. Echo, cardiac MRI are normal. Cardiac MRI was done post RF ablation and also has come out to be normal. MRI was ordered to rule out any structural abnormalities and to rule to ARVD, and cardiomyopathy. I am feeling back ache, shoulder ache, and mild chest discomfort now continuously for a few days. It looks very much like muscle and back pain that I have always and is not related to exertion as some times I feel it even while sleeping. I have not been doing any physical exercise for a couple of months and have put on some weight too. With normal MRI, echo, ECG except for ectopic beats, can I conclude the pain is not cardiac related? Attaching here with my reports. Does the MRI report also talk about ischemic factors or should I under go any further cardiac tests to rule out cardiac factors? If not cardiac, which specialist should I consult now for my back pain?","Doctor":"Hello. I had gone through your all reports. (attachment removed to protect patient identity).  Your Holter monitoring suggestive of premature ventricular beats some time occasionally, sometime in bigeminy, other time in couplet or NSVT (nonsustained ventricular tachycardia) this could contribute to irregular pulse or palpitation. MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) not suggesting any ischemic areas, and your RVOT (right ventricular outflow tract) also not unduly dilated. There is a very mild defect in the mitral valve but that is not contributing to regurgitation or any symptom so nothing to worry and yes, you can exclude cardiac factor but only after some investigation like x-ray whole spine (cervical, thoracic and lumbosacral region). For your shoulder and back pain, I want to ask a few things. Since how long you are suffering from this? Is this pain radiate to arms also? Back pain is confined to which area? Lower back or upper back? Did you have an episode of palpitation along with chest discomfort? Until then, I will advise you to use the hard bed without a pillow, do some physical exercises.

I have several phobias and have recently acquired a new one, fear of death. I cannot stop thinking about it and it is seriously interfering with my life. I have trouble getting up in the mornings and going to work, I do not feel like doing anything anymore. This has been going on for over two weeks now and nothing feels the same to me anymore. I do not feel normal at all and nothing seems real. I recently started on Prozac 10 mg and I am currently on day eight. I wake up with a lot of anxiety in the mornings and today I am just feeling very weird. Is this something someone can get over? I just want to go back to normal.","Doctor":"Hello. Your current symptoms of difficulty in waking up and loss of interest in work, with severe anxiety, is indicative of clinical depression. What you describe as death phobia involves obsessive thinking about death. So, it is more likely to be a symptom of OCD (obsessive-compulsive disorder) too. OCD and depression frequently coexist or obsessive symptoms are seen in depression too. Fluoxetine is not the preferred drug for anxious depression with OCD symptoms, because it increases anxiety initially in the first few weeks. You need to take a Benzodiazepine along with it in the initial few weeks (Clonazepam, Chlordiazepoxide, etc). Benzodiazepines work better than Vistaril (Hydroxyzine) PRN. Also, 10 mg per day is a starting dose. I would prefer using Fluvoxamine rather than Fluoxetine because it covers initial anxiety and it can be started at an effective dose. To answer your question, it is not something that you can overcome on your own. You will need medicines. It will respond to regular and proper medication. Secondly, if you are feeling weird, talk to your doctor and ask if he can give you a Benzodiazepine. The initial anxiety on Fluoxetine gives a weird feeling. Also, ask if he can give a different antidepressant instead. I hope this helps."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, My father had a sudden weight loss. CT abdomen was done.

I have late-stage cystic fibrosis, and I am experiencing a few months of exacerbation that has led to me needing oxygen full time. A few weeks ago I began, for the first time, to titrate my O2 saturation vigilantly to between 90-95%, to combat Co2 retention. Previously, even when sick and using O2 full time, I had not retained Co2. But on my recent ER visit when I was in pulmonary distress (very short of breath) my pCo2 was 65. I was advised to titrate it. I had been advised before, but I had not always done so rigorously, because frankly it just felt uncomfortable. This time I stuck to it, however, because I was very nervous about increased Co2 retention. My pCo2 has wavered around, from 65-62-57-62-58, in about three weeks. The thing that has significantly changed, however, is that I am no longer sensitive to low oxygen saturation. My breathing is much more shallow, and I can sit comfortably at 90% and not even feel bad. It is scary because I can also be walking around and desaturating to 85% without even feeling it. I used to be able to know my oxygen saturation just by feel and how short of breath I was. My breathing, as I said, is very shallow even as I desaturate. It is only when I exercise to a certain point, at high levels of O2, that I am able to inhale and exhale involuntarily and deeply. I have some different issues that make me wonder if the protocol for titrating oxygen at low saturations for Co2 retention is the right treatment for me, and I am going in circles trying to figure it out. My doctors do not seem too concerned about my Co2 retention in general, given my late-stage CF and that I am about to be listed for a transplant, but I always want to figure out what is the best thing to be doing. I have a right to left pulmonary shunt. It is demonstrated when I lie down. My O2 saturation actually rises while lying down, and rises higher if I lie on my left side vs right. So I believe that this would be a component in that venous blood is being recycled into arterial blood but I do not have a grasp of how that could effect Co2 retention (only that it can lower my O2 saturation). Secondly, I am very anemic. My hemoglobin has dropped from 9-7 g/dL in the recent three weeks. I have always been anemic, but I have become even more so in the past three weeks, despite having been sick with exacerbations for months. The last three weeks have been different. (For example, I am also experiencing low magnesium for the first time, and we keep supplementing, but I cannot get my levels up). Lastly, my lungs have improved and infection has cleared somewhat, but I have not been able to come closer at all to being off oxygen. I know I do need to accept that maybe this is not a reality. But regardless, my O2 needs are lower, yet as soon as I exercise or move around even a little, they drop rapidly. Before three weeks, it was much less extreme. Now, I can sit resting on 1 liter and have a saturation of 97, yet as soon as I get up and move for 15 seconds, it drops quickly to the 80's. There are all these components, lungs (shot), anemia (no red blood cells to carry), and pulmonary shunt (diversion of oxygenated blood), that I am trying to piece together to figure out if titrating my oxygen to lower numbers is actually helping me or hurting me?","Doctor":"Hello. Well, that was a wonderful and well-detailed query. I will answer your query in parts. Regarding your insensitivity to low O2 saturation: Well, this is an expected development in long-standing lung problems. Continuous exposure to low oxygen levels over long time will decrease the brain's sensitivity for low oxygen and hence that is the reason you breathe shallow in spite of desaturation. So the body's next line of defense for low oxygen is CO2. When the brain's sensitivity to oxygen is reduced then the brain uses CO2 level to trigger breathing. But because of your advanced cystic fibrosis exchange of Co2 and O2 is not happening adequately at the lung level and hence your body is retaining Co2 because it is not able to remove it out. My advice at this point is to do breathing exercises, take long inhalation and long exhalation. Also, do incentive spirometry exercise. Coming to your hypothesis of right to left shunt you are absolutely right. But shunting could be at the lung level or at the heart level. In your case, the chances of shunt being at lung are more likely but still, tests should be done so that there is no shunting at the heart. For that, I advise you get echo with contrast with positional change maneuver. If your venous blood is being recycled into arterial blood then the total Co2 content of the blood increase (as venous blood contains more CO2 than arterial) and thus the Co2 gradient (the difference between arterial Co2 and alveolar or in simple terms lung Co2) decrease and Co2 elimination is directly dependent on Co2 gradient. Higher the gradient more the elimination and less retention and vice versa. Anemia contributing to O2 desaturation and Co2 retention: If you are anemic then your blood carries less O2 so at rest your O2 demands would be less but on exercise your O2 demands increase a lot which cannot be met due to low O2 carrying capacity of your blood, thus leading to profound O2 desaturation. But what is not know is why are you suffering from anemia? What is the cause? Because if we can correct your anemia your O2 requirement even on exercise can come down. I advise if any evaluation from your anemia point of view has been done kindly upload so that I can help further. Until your cardiac evaluation for intra cardiac shunt and anemia evaluation are completed, I advise you to keep titrating your O2 to maintain spo2 > =95% both at rest and on mild exercise. Till correction of any shunt (if possible) and correction of anemia is done you will desaturate on exercise and hence increase O2 during exercise."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am suffering from dysentery (not sure) from last couple of months. I found blood in my stool. So the doctor suggested to do colonoscopy test. Colonoscopy report says that there is one small papilla near anorectal junction, may be cause of the bleeding. The doctor gave me tablets and till then everything was fine and the same doctor told me that it is because of dysentery. But from the last couple of weeks, there is too much of bleed in my stool with lower abdominal pain and fever every night. Motion is kind of semi-solid and 4 to 5 times in a day I have to go to toilet. I have consulted many doctors but nothing is work out. Can someone please put me in touch with some speciality doctor? I also had treatment of homeopathy for two months without any success. I am totally frustrated.","Doctor":"Hi. Frequent motions along with blood for weeks is not due to dysentry. Also a small papilla causing this amount of symptoms is very unlikely. So what else it could be? It can be inflammatory bowel disease, malignancy, chronic infections, tuberculosis.

Needed support of wall (sometimes) or a person. 4. Unable to walk on uneven road.","Doctor":"Hi. It appears that the patient is having neurological problem at multiple levels. 1. Causes for imbalance while walking:  - Problem in cerebellum (part of brain), unlikely in this case as the MRI of brain was normal (attachment removed to protect patient identity).  - Weakness in one part of the body might have happened due to stroke, even then MRI brain should have shown that. - Weakness in both lower limbs due to problems in spinal cord. This is more likely as loss of control over urine and motion can also be seen in spinal cord problems and the test mentioned by you have not evaluated spinal cord problems.  My advice is get one MRI whole spine done and upload me the report.  2. BP tablets will not cause any of these symptoms, so I advise to continue the BP tablets so that BP is maintained less than 140/80.  3. Vertin and Vertizac can be stopped.  4. Stop Deplat- A, Rozucor instead start tablet Ecosprin -AV.  5. Because of taking previous all those tablets he might be having acidity problems which gets exacerbated by any citrus fruits like lemon, so, I advise him to take antacid like Syrup Mucane gel 10 ml 3 times a day before food.

I have emetophobia, which is a phobia of vomiting. This is not just \\"oh, yeah no one likes to throw up\\". This is a debilitating fear that effects a person's everyday life. Pretty much every second of everyday is spent wondering and fearing that I could possibly throw up, even though this is obviously something that happens rarely. If I ever feel sick this results in me shaking uncontrollably, I get that scared. So, I read online that when one has Norovirus for example, it is the intestines that are infected, and vomiting is just the body's useless response and does not help you get better. I wanted to know if the same goes for food poisoning. Would I be okay if I took antiemetics if I felt sick and knew that I had eaten something bad? What are the consequences of doing this? I know if that ever happens to me I will take them unless it could be deadly or something. I do plan on getting help for my phobia in the future. Until then, I will do this. I have a great deal of self control with the pills and do not take them just because I feel panicky. I have had them for a long time and have yet to take any, and will not unless I know for sure that I am sick. But I want to know this for future reference in case I need them one day. Also I think it is important I mention that I am otherwise healthy adult and have no health issues in the past.","Doctor":"Hi. First of all I would like to clarify that vomiting is not a useless response of the body. It is body's way of conveying that something wrong is there that needs to be corrected. For example in food poisoning the body vomits so that it throws away all the food that is in the stomach so that the body is free of toxic substance. Also, vomiting can happen in conditions other than gut related like some problem in the brain, eye, liver, pancreas, etc. And sometimes vomiting may be the only sign or clue to detect those problems. So unless the cause for vomiting is diagnosed just suppressing vomit by medication is not right. Like in food poisoning after taking anti-vomiting medicines vomit may stop but not the food poisoning which requires antibiotics. So, my advise is yes you can take antiemetics when you feel sick but you should also consult a doctor to find out what made you sick. But till you consult a doctor you can take antiemetics, no problem with that. I advise you take tablet Ondansetron 4 mg when you feel nauseous. Also as you said take a psychiatric counselling for your phobia."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor,I am just wondering what is abutting and abutment of the nerve root means in a back issue. Please explain.

I went to physical therapy, the pain resolved, and I continue to do the exercises for 10 minutes every other day. No more pain though. The thing is even before the pain (years before) and still now after the pain is gone, I seem to have a slight numbness or I guess I would not call it a numbness but rather I have less feeling on the left scrotum and penis area in comparison to the right side. Maybe 25 % less. Could this be from the herniated disc? It was there years before the pain and is still there now after the pain from the herniated disc has resolved. I have also noticed other parts of my body have more sensation on the right side as apposed to the left. The more sensitive the area the more of a difference there is up to 25 %. Is that normal? Is it possible to have a herniated disc only cause slight numbness for years without any pain at all? Also it should be noted this sensation of lessened feeling on the left side compared to the right presented itself a few months after I had a varicolectomy on the left side. Maybe the incision caused a little nerve damage? I would hate to think that this lessened sensation was getting worse over time at such a slow rate that I did not notice it until it was too late. I do not think it is getting worse. Should I worry about this? Also, now that the pain is gone does that mean that the disc is back where it should be or did the exercises only get rid of the symptoms?","Doctor":"Hello. Varicolectomy on the left side might have damaged some nerve twigs which may be the reason for this kind of diminished sensation over left scrotum and penis. This will not cause any problem and you need not worry about it.The herniated disc is of small magnitude which is not expected to cause neurological damage except for lower back pain. It might not have gone back to its original position though pain subsided. You should avoid strenuous activities (lifting heavy weights, extreme bending, etc.). But if you have diminished sensation in whole of your left side of body, you should look into spinal cord lesion in neck region or brain lesion."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I have noticed dark (do not know if they are dark-brown, more greenish, or black) flecks in what looks like otherwise very normal stool.

One side is paralytic. We are trying to seek advice as to if we can do something more for him. I can attach the MRI brain report. The doctors have kept him in ICU under 72 hours observation. Please suggest if something can be done.","Doctor":"Hello. From your description and the MRI report, it is quite clear that the patient is suffering from what is commonly known as brain stroke (attachment removed to protect patient identity). It occurs when part of the brain loses its blood supply and the brain cells of this area die out, resulting in loss of function of the affected area like consciousness, speech, movement (paralysis), etc. My hospital has several patients of the same type everyday. In most cases, it is a recoverable condition, albeit sometimes the recovery may be very slow and sometimes incomplete. The most dreaded effect of the stroke is the loss of respiratory function, as in that case, the patient would die immediately. Hence, the 72 hours observation in the ICU is a sensible choice. Is there anything more you can do more him? Yes, of course. While the doctors and nurses are trying to do their best for the patient, there are quite a few things that you can do to help this family. Foremost is to explain to the patient's family that his recovery may be slow and there is nothing to lose heart. Secondly, the family members should refrain from trying to enter the ICU too often to see him. It may cause an infection in the patient at this vulnerable stage. After the patient comes out of the ICU, depending on the facilities available at the hospital, it is to be ensured that the semi-conscious or unconscious patient receives full hygienic care like cleaning mouth and teeth, eyes, ears, private areas at least thrice daily. If the patient is fed through a nasal tube, the head-end of the bed is to be raised during the feeding process and upto about 15 minutes afterwards. In many cases, these may be done by the nursing staff, so you do not have to worry. Overall, in the immediate present stage, it is mostly a matter of \\"wait for the treatment to succeed\\", comfort the family and follow the advice of the doctor."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am a 23-year-old male.

Most of us behave in this way only. There is nothing abnormal in masturbating once you get an erection after seeing sexy pictures. By the way, masturbation is natural sex which is practiced mainly because the other partner is not available. This is the way of releasing sexual tension by self. Regarding your neurosurgery incident, I like to assure you that there is no relation in the majority. If you had a gross change in your personality and sexuality following surgery then also you need to be assessed for further management. If you had any change after surgery or your frequency is too high than desirable then book an appointment with me. I will help you with every possible means."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I have multiple small cysts in both ovaries (PCOS). Our family friend suggested me to consume Kalarchikai medicine, powdered mixed with pepper and honey to have it for one mandalam (48 days). I have completed nearly 44 days by consuming one small ball of the mixture every morning and before two weeks I got my periods. Then I had checked whether the cysts were dissolved by having an abdomen scan. But still, small multiple follicules have been seen in it with both ovaries enlarged. Kindly suggest me what I can do further. I got married before one and a half years and I am much worried about my pregnancy. I have gallstones as well.","Doctor":"Hello. I just read your query. See Kalarachi Kai choornam is helpful in amenorrhea. As far as small cysts are concerned they are unmatured eggs which failed to induce menstrual cycle previously, as a result, they got collected in the ovary and they will remain in the ovary. Now, you have got your periods you can start trying for conception. But I advise you to do it under the supervision of a nearby gynecologist because egg size is important while conception and that you can know by ovulation study. Ovulation study is performed under the supervision of a gynecologist. For gall stones, surgical intervention is required generally. Medicine is not of much help."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, A 34-year-old female is having thick red rashes on the face. Please suggest.","Doctor":"Hello. The thick red rashes on the face can be because of many reasons like allergic contact dermatitis, papular urticaria, irritant contact dermatitis, and many more. I need to know more details like for how long are they present? Are they itchy? Are they transient or persistent? Kindly answer my questions and if possible kindly attach a picture of the lesion so that I can see the lesions and help you to my best."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am 36 years old and weigh about 100 kg with no medical conditions except for hypothyroid. Can I get pregnant?","Doctor":"Hello. You surely can become pregnant. Keep a watch on your weight and keep thyroid under control by maintaining TSH (thyroid-stimulating hormone) levels around 3.5. Obesity usually is associated with insulin resistance and may be PCOS (polycystic ovary syndrome) in your pelvic scan. First, take a fair trial especially on your ovulatory days (pregnancy days), and work on the above factors. You will have to continue antithyroid drugs during pregnancy also."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I suffer a lot from headaches. Sometimes I have this pain on my whole head, but one side pains more. Sometimes I just have this pain on the back of my head. My neck and everything just pains I cannot even keep my eyes open or put my head down, or sleep. I have these headaches almost every day it is like off and on the whole day. Sometimes I spew, or I feel nauseous. I only take strong tablets like Syndol, Myprodol, Pynstop, and Damadol. But sometimes these pills do not work for me. I do not take Panado, Disprin or Grand-pa, it does not work for me and makes me spewy like. I would like your doctor's advice because these headaches have been going on for a very long time, and every year it is getting worse. Is this serious? What can I do about this? What type of headache is this? I know taking so many pills is not good. Please advice.","Doctor":"Hello. If you would have presented to me as an outpatient, I would have advised you to do mental relaxation exercises, yoga, and meditation. If I am asked to make a clinical diagnosis on the basis of medical history, I would say tension-type headache (TTH) without any doubt. Headache at the back of the head with associated neck pain, inability to put the head down and difficulty in getting sleep all are very classical for TTH. Meditation and yoga will definitely help if it is TTH. Regarding drug therapy, my advice is to stop all the current medications you are taking and start taking tablet Tryptomer (Amitriptyline) 25 mg half tablet for initial two days and then full tablet daily while going to sleep in the night. Please take the medicines under the guidance of a physician only. I hope this helps."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am a 23-year-old male. I have no symptoms and I am not taking any current medication. Three years ago I once went to the hospital because I felt my heart was beating really fast, and they did some EKG scans and a blood test on me saying that everything is normal. They also gave me the Holter monitor and when they checked the results they said this was normal. I do not smoke or drink alcohol maybe three times a year I will drink. I used to do some shisha but that has stopped for the past three years. Since then I have never been to a hospital for the health of my heart. However, since then, my heartbeat has just been higher than everyone else but I do not get headaches or any other symptoms. I used to stress a lot. However, things are going well now and it has cut down. I wake up at times during the night but fall back asleep very easily. I have done gym and dance classes for over a year and I feel fine when working out. I went to the GP just a week ago due to my girlfriend having some concerns. I asked them to do a regular check and they said my heartbeat at that moment was 98 and he said this was fine. However, my girlfriend gets really worried about this and feels that something will happen to me. She just needs some medical advice in order to get her the assurance. She has been checking online for some answers and it is said stuff like arrhythmia, tachycardia, etc. She also says that the normal is between 80-100 bpm and why is mine on the top end? Is it a serious cause? Or does heart and pulse rate vary? Also, I have been checking the prevalence of heart diseases, etc., online and it is very rare for someone at my age. What more should be done?","Doctor":"Hello. Palpitations or the feeling of fast heart beat is an extremely common symptom. I understand your GP has done the usual tests and has reassured you. I would need a bit more history. Have you fainted anytime? Have you got your thyroid functions checked? Do you have history of any family member dying suddenly, like in sleep? Is your blood pressure normal? If none of the above mentioned problems are there it is likely that your symptoms are benign. Just watch out for fainting episodes. The heart rate you mentioned is perfectly normal. The best way to get your heart rate even lower is to exercise regularly, athletes have very low heart rates. Also, you have to address your stress levels and need to pro-actively take steps to reduce your stress levels. Only if the palpitations are really persisting and are really disabling we need to do further tests."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I have three kids. My oldest is 16 years and she is a bit hard to deal with. I have been noticing her change of moods everyday. My mother, older sister, and younger brother told my middle son, that they hate her, no one wants her close. She had a rough break up, she says she hates life and has no friends. I understand the pain that she feels, but what worries me is that after a great day she suddenly has a mood where she cries, shuts off the world, without anyone telling her anything. She has suicidal thoughts. I have noticed she gained wait and lost interest in fun activities. She stays up all night crying on the phone texting or I do not know. She cries a lot. I try to talk to her, but she does not talk at all and just cried. She listens to sad music. I could say she has bipolar disorder (depressive). Is it possible?","Doctor":"Hello. Going by the description of your daughter's life circumstances and events, she seems to be in depression definitely. Is she in bipolar depression can only be determined if she exhibits the following. 1) Cycles of depression and mania. 2) There should be discrete episodes of depression lasting days to months (like the one she is currently) and mania also lasting days to months. 3) There ought to be periods of normalcy between maniac and depressive episodes. 4) Maniac episodes consist of irritability or euphoric mood, over activity, decreased need for sleep, over-talkative, grandiose, hyper sexuality, the flight of ideas and pressure of speech. And yes, the treatment will depend upon whether she is suffering from unipolar depression or bipolar depression. Another important thing I like to highlight is her gaining weight. This can be due to depression per se, or it may due to underlying medical problems such as hypothyroidism, which in itself could lead to presentation mimicking depression. She should be investigated to find the cause of gaining weight. Finally, the most important thing I would like you to look at is her suicidal ideations. This should be taken very seriously. You should keep the following things in the mind: 1. Never take a person’s expressed wish to die non-seriously even if expressed in anger. 2. A person who repeatedly threatens suicide but does not commit suicide is at higher risk to commit suicide. 3. It has been seen that a person who has committed suicide has had given some sort of forewarning. 4. Always keep a vigil on people with chronic illnesses and psychiatric illnesses. 5. Once a person has attempted suicide but could not succeed, extra care should be taken. Rules to be followed when a person expresses a suicidal idea or has attempted suicide are: Contact a psychiatrist to assess the person’s suicidal risk by scales. If the person has been identified with a psychiatric illness it should be treated promptly. Keep an eye on the person and keep dangerous things out of his reach. There may be a need for hospitalization. Do not criticize a person for the act but extent full family support for the speedy recovery and moral support so that the person does not repeat the act. Depressed patients coming out of depression are at a particularly high risk of suicide called paradoxical suicide and should be under supervision until complete recovery. So it is very important for you to contact a psychiatrist and start treatment as soon as possible. I hope that your daughter comes out of this depression quickly and leads a healthy life ahead."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I have recently been feeling nauseous and fatigued. I have a paranoia about being pregnant, but I am not sure if I should be worried or not. For about a year I have been consistently taking the birth control pill, every night at the same time. The last time I had sex was the day before my period was supposed to occur (according to my BCP schedule). It was without a condom, and my partner ejaculated inside of me. The next day I got my period and it was normal. A week after I finished my period I started to feel nauseous. I stayed on the pill and had my period again at the correct time. It was a bit lighter than normal but still enough to fill a tampon or two. I have just started back on the pills and feel slightly nauseous again. Do you think I have cause to be concerned? Or is everything normal?","Doctor":"Hello. The nauseous feeling you are experiencing on and off is most probably related to the birth control pills you are on and by the history you are giving, there is a least chance of being pregnant. So you need not worry. Nausea is a very common side effect with pill usage. I would suggest you take an anti-emetic tablet after seeing your doctor for a few days. It must subside with it, if that does not have any effect, then you may need to switch over to a different combination pill that would suit you. Sometimes even hormonal changes in the body during and after menses or at the time of a forthcoming menses could cause nausea. Make sure you drink lots of water."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor,I am just wondering what is abutting and abutment of the nerve root means in a back issue. Please explain.

First I want to know whats your height before determining whether your weight is less or normal. Also how old are you? Many people up to the age of 25-26 will not gain weight and look slim and later they start gaining weight without doing anything. The simple principle of weight gain is you have to consume more calories. Take more fatty food like red meat, cheese, ghee, nuts, etc. Also, eat two eggs daily that will help. I advise you to do some exercise daily initially aerobic exercise like jogging and after a few weeks start gyming. Also, get these blood tests done to know whether are you losing or not gaining weight because of some diseases. 1. Fasting Blood sugar. 2. TSH (thyroid-stimulating hormone), done in the fasting condition."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, My routine urine examination shows: Trans-hazy. Reaction - 6.0pH. blood - ++. RBC - 15-20 hpf.

I have gone through your query and understood your concerns. In my opinion, the picture you have sent may be either warts or molluscum. As both mentioned diseases are contagious you must be careful from now onwards. If you have a weak immune system then it will take time to go away. I would like to suggest you go to a dermatologist once so that they can scrap the area and see that in a microscope. For now, I will prescribe one ointment that is Imiquimod cream. Use this cream three days a week (Monday, Wednesday, and Friday). To use the cream, follow these steps: Wash your hands. Wash the area to be treated with mild soap and water and allow it to dry. Apply a thin layer of cream to the area to be treated, just before going to sleep. Rub the cream into the skin until it disappears. Wash your hands. Leave the cream on the area for six to ten hours. Do not bathe, shower, or swim during this time and no sexual contact at this time. After the treatment time is over, wash the area with mild soap and water to remove any cream. If there are any side effects with that cream contact your dermatologist."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I would like to know how to reset my circadian rhythm from being advanced to a more normal schedule. I have been going to bed around 9 pm and waking up at 5 am. I would like to shift my rhythms to waking up at 7 am and going to bed around 11 pm. I get very sleepy at around 8:30 to 9 pm, but if I push through and stay awake until 10 or 11 pm, I still end up waking up at 5 am without an alarm. It is as if my body does not want to sleep in. It is winter where I live, so sunset happens around 5 pm, so staying outside to get bright light is not an option at the moment. It feels similar to jet lag, is this something I could fix with properly timed Melatonin supplements and staying in the bright light of my house in the evening? Any help would be appreciated. I am physically healthy otherwise and I am not taking any medication.","Doctor":"Hello. It is nice to see that you are so aware of your sleep rhythms. Advanced sleep phase syndrome (ASPS) is common in the elderly and not so common in your age. However, your symptoms match ASPS and I will suggest some techniques to delay your circadian rhythm. Ensure that your room has the curtains closed at night. Try wearing a cloth eye mask if you are comfortable wearing it. Avoid going outside the early morning. The idea is to delay your exposure to bright light very early in the morning. If circadian rhythm disturbances are common in your family, or there is a long past history of the same in your case, you can consider investing in a bright light lamp. Our indoor lights are of negligible intensity as compared to sunlight (100 lux vs 10000 lux). So exposure to indoor light will not help much. However, there are bright lights that emit bright light of significant intensity. You can buy them online. Exposure to them in the evening can help in delaying your advanced sleep phase schedule. The whole idea is to minimize your bright light exposure early in the day and increasing it in the evenings. Melatonin supplements could help theoretically, but you need to take it late at around 11.30 pm, so the effect will last till early morning.  Sleep schedule is called so because it is a habit. It cannot be learned or unlearned in a day. You will not see results in a day or even a week. Regularly practicing sleeping late in the day for two to three weeks should help you. I hope this helps."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, In a 17-month-old female child. We keep treating the symptoms but not the overall problem of why these things keep happening. Hardly any tests have been ordered, and we are constantly just treating the symptoms. The problems are: Bronchitis, and right ear infection for which antibiotics and nebulizer tx are given. A month after double ear infection and labored breathing for which antibiotics and nebulizer are given. Labored breathing continues along with fever, right ear infection and left ear drainage. Other histories,double inguinal hernia surgery when three weeks old. Tongue and lip tie surgery at 11 months. What could be causing this? What other tests should we be looking into?","Doctor":"Hello. Thanks for the detailed history. The history which you have described basically shows that the child is suffering from repeated lower respiratory tract infection, which usually presents as cough, fever, breathlessness for which nebulization and antibiotics were given. Our respiratory tract, ear, nose, and throat are interconnected organs and any issue with one of the structures especially nose and airway can indirectly involve the ear, so the child is having repeated ear infection which is technically known as acute suppurative otitis media. Now, the cause for repeated lower respiratory tract infection in a 2-year-old child are many, which may be innate deficiency of immunity, genetic problems with respiratory epithelial cells (for ex Kartageners syndrome, Immotile cilia syndrome). Rarely unnoticed foreign body in the bronchus can present with such repeated chest infections (lower respiratory tract infection). So unless a further evaluation is done it is very difficult to identify the cause. The child may need to undergo tests such as CT (computed tomography) scan of thorax, bronchoscopy, etc. You need to visit a pediatric pulmonologist for a detailed evaluation. One thing to say is such repeated lower respiratory tract infection with a middle ear infection is not very normal and proper diagnosis needs to be made."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I have haemoglobin D traits.

When I tried to pop it I noticed that it was hard. It hurts when I walk and I now have three bumps. Two of them are flat now.","Doctor":"Hello,  Welcome to icliniq.com. We appreciate your concern about your skin eruption. Before I am able to help you in this regard, I would like to have the following additional information: What was the location of the original and recent bumps? Specifically, were they on the upper side of the toe near the hairy area or over the soles? What has been the duration of the first bump? Can you post a photograph of the same? In case the bumps are on the upper side of the toe, in particular, if they seem to be arising from or near the hair follicles, then they could indicate furuncles, which are deep-seated infections of the hair follicle and though they can arise in healthy individuals, they are a little more common in diabetics. They are painful, warm and become hard, but often show a visible yellowish pus point. In that case, we would have to suggest a short course of oral antibiotics and anti-inflammatory medicines and suggest an antibiotic cream. In case they are on the sole i.e. undersurface of the toes, then they could be corns. But corns typically are of long duration, appear over pressure prone areas of the toe and do not subside on their own. They also hurt on walking. They can be treated medically as well as surgically. Thus, to be able to guide you for the best treatment, I need to have your answers to my three questions raised above."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, My mother is 75 years old. She had been treated for TB (tuberculosis) of the abdomen as her ultrasound of abdomen finding was thicken bowel loop. In general terms, it was informed about TB in her abdomen. Accordingly, medicines were given to her as per the advise of a local MD doctor. Treatment continued for three months and due to some discontinuation of medicine it relapsed and again she was diagnosed with Thicken bowel loop as per USG. Again treatment continued. However, while undergoing treatment she lost sensation in her legs and complained of losing sensation in her legs and numbness in her feet and was unable to put on slippers in her feet with difficulty in moving. She also complained that while moving she felt as if she was moving on a bed of soft cotton. Subsequent treatment by neuro experts revealed that overdose of treatment of her TB in abdomen resulted in this condition and she was diagnosed for peripheral neuropathy and was advised for biopsy for proper diagnosis. Meanwhile, she fell and hurt herself which was later on diagnosed that her spine at L3 - L4 was compressed due to felling abruptly and accordingly she was advised to take bed rest for three months. Slowly, she recovered from this condition felt pain in her back and was facing another kind of problem as she could not sit for a longer time and preferred to lay down on the bed. Finding her bad condition subsequetly, we also took consultation from other neuro experts at a prestigious institution where she was prescribed Lupivitin one tablet and Sammy one tablet. When condition persisted thereafter she was given Primosa one tablet daily, Neurox one tablet daily, Maxglobin 50 mg one tablet and Defart 6 mg. But, whenever she was given medicine her condition further aggravated. After about six months of treatment by the neuro expert, she has now been referred to the department of immunology for their advice. Meanwhile, we also took advice from a rheumatologist who diagnosed a kind of arthritis and started treating accordingly. He also started the course of Defzacort (steroid) along with other medicines. The steroid was prescribed with a decreasing dose per week from 60 mg per day to 6 mg per day. However, after taking about two months of steroid course her condition deteriorated and had severe breathlessness. Her blood sugar level also shot up and ultimately she was hospitalized and the treatment of steroid withdrawn. After 15 days of treatment at the hospital she recovered to her previous condition.

I have carefully gone through the details provided by you and have short-listed the following possibilities. Isoniazid-induced peripheral neuropathy, which occurs in a few patients who are on anti-tubercular drugs (including Isoniazid-INH). The specific treatment for drug-induced neuropathy is Pyridoxine (vitamin B9), available under the brand name of Pyricontin 100 mg tablets. You may, therefore, start immediately with 50 mg Pyridoxine per day for two months initially. The decision to continue further will depend on the response and, whether the neuropathy is reversible or has reached an irreversible stage. In addition, the addition of vitamin B12 (Methylcobalamin) 1500 micrograms/day would be of great benefit. Compressive Myelopathy, due to compression over the terminal end of the spine at L3-L4 level, following trauma. If that is the cause, then surgical decompression is the only treatment of choice. The neurosurgeon will get a repeat MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) myelogram done and depending on the findings, remove part of the discs or bone which is pressing over the nerves supplying the legs. Consult your doctor and apprise him of my opinion. I am certain that he will agree with me, order the required test, and based on the reports we will arrive at a certain diagnosis and prescribe suitable treatment as advised.

Firstly, during our baby dentition stage, we have two incisors, one canine, and two molars (on each side). 10 teeth on each jaw, a total of 20 teeth. Premolars come into play only during the adult dentition stage. And to your second question, yes, this is absolutely normal at the age of 10, to feel some of your teeth getting loose.

Baby teeth look small than the adult teeth. The color of the baby teeth is dull-white whereas the adult teeth are brighter yellowish white. Right now, you will have permanent incisors (top four and bottom four), permanent first molars (top right one and top left one, and bottom right one and left one, totally four) fully erupted and probably bottom permanent canine erupting, one on each side.

Our family friend suggested me to consume Kalarchikai medicine, powdered mixed with pepper and honey to have it for one mandalam (48 days). I have completed nearly 44 days by consuming one small ball of the mixture every morning and before two weeks I got my periods. Then I had checked whether the cysts were dissolved by having an abdomen scan. But still, small multiple follicules have been seen in it with both ovaries enlarged. Kindly suggest me what I can do further. I got married before one and a half years and I am much worried about my pregnancy. I have gallstones as well.","Doctor":"Hello. I just read your query. See Kalarachi Kai choornam is helpful in amenorrhea. As far as small cysts are concerned they are unmatured eggs which failed to induce menstrual cycle previously, as a result, they got collected in the ovary and they will remain in the ovary. Now, you have got your periods you can start trying for conception. But I advise you to do it under the supervision of a nearby gynecologist because egg size is important while conception and that you can know by ovulation study.

She was 2.5 kg at the time of birth. I am using Lactogen 1, as the breast milk of my wife is very very low. I informed the pediatrician who takes care of my baby that we are giving 3oz but my baby after taking 1.5-2.5oz is refusing to accept as she is sleepy and we are unable to intake her anymore. Sometimes the baby is sleeping for four to five hours without consuming and sometimes she is sucking her fingers after two to three hours and when we are giving the feeding bottle she is taking 1.5-2 oz. The main problem is that we failed to understand whether my baby is hungry or she is sleepy as in both the cases baby sucks her finger. After explaining the same, the pediatrician said that she has not gained much weight and advised to have urine and blood test for CBC and TSH. When I asked him that whether can I change the formula milk he said that all are same and if we wish, we can change but has not given any suggestion. Please help me whether I need to change the formula milk and can use Dexolac 1 by replacing Lactogen 1? I cannot afford costly formula milk. Also, please guide me that how much oz I have to give and how much gaping is needed? Also when the baby is sleeping, shall I awake her and give the feeding? Please suggest.","Doctor":"Hello. No need to change the formula milk, continue the same formula milk, as the baby grows there is no hard and fast rule that the baby takes milk every two hours. The feeding should be on demand, whenever the baby wants milk she will cry. The best method to see whether milk is enough or not is to see the number of times the baby is passing urine. If it is six times a day that means the milk is enough. Since your baby was preterm the growth might be a little slow, you should be worried only if the baby is not tolerating feeds like if she is vomiting too much or having too much of loose stools."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, My penis skin end has got tiny cuts around and it is not healing for more than one month.

She is currently taking iron tablets twice a day (three weeks back she did Hb test, and it was 9 g/dL) and calcium tablets. She has occasional leg cramps, especially when waking up. Last week her gynecologist prescribed her Nurokind-LC twice a day for two weeks (she said leg cramps can occur during labor). As Nurokind-LC is class C, is it safe to take it in this dose? Can we take a reduced dose (one tablet for one week)? Please advise.","Doctor":"Hello,  Welcome to icliniq.com. There is usually dilutional anemia at this stage of pregnancy and the requirement is much more. She has been prescribed Nurokind-LC tablet because of cramps in the legs as it is a neurovitamin and also for prophylaxis of megaloblastic anemia as it contains folic acid and methylcobalamin. You may take it once a day and in addition to that, I will advise you to improve diet containing iron and things that increase absorption of iron in the body. For this, if your wife is a vegetarian then she should take jaggery instead of sugar and things made by that. Beetroot is a very rich source of iron for vegetarians taken as such or in some fruit juice. If non-vegetarian liver and chicken made at home are very good and baked fish for omega3 fatty acids. Leg cramps can occur any time as such also and not only during labor. She should take plenty of fluids including coconut water which is a rich source of potassium and very helpful for preventing cramps. Keep moving her legs and feet and avoid long-standing or hanging feet. As she has already taken a double dose of iron tablets for three weeks you may repeat her Hb (hemoglobin) after another one week and see, or she can be given iv (intravenous) iron after consulting your doctor."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I started to take a birth control pill. The pill name is Diane-35, it is taken for 21 days and seven days for rest. I have just finished the first pack of 21 pills, and as far as I understand, that my period should come in these seven days, right? And also I have read on the internet that if you do not wait for seven days to start a new pack and instead immediately start a new pack, you will miss your period, is it true? Is it fine to do if it is the first pack I have taken, will it mess with my cycle as I am still adapting to the actual pill? If no, is there any other way to delay or miss a period, because I really need to?","Doctor":"Hello. Yes, it is correct that if you have taken these pills for 21 days, your periods are expected to come in the next few days, as it will cause hormonal withdrawal which leads to cause bleeding. It is true that if you continue to take these medicines your periods will be delayed. And if you want to delay your periods, continuing these pills without any break for the next 21 days is the best option.  The only problem which you may face with this is heavy bleeding when you will stop these after the next 21 days. You will not be messing it up with your normal cycle if you continue it for the next 21 days. Just keep one thing in mind that you should not miss any pill as this can cause bleeding or spotting in between the cycle."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am having pain at my back neck since morning and could not even move my neck. 2 years ago I had same, MRI showed disc bulge at C3-C4 and C6-C7 is causing thecal indentation. Central disc protrusion at C4-C5 and C5-C6 is causing thecal indentation.","Doctor":"Hello. Looking into your problem you had chronic neck pain I should say and you are struggling with it since long time (2 years). MRI from the past (attachment removed to protect patient identity) is showing that there is problem from C3/4/5/6/7 but major level that is producing pressure symptom in your spinal nerve is C4-5 and 5-6 has central disc protrusion.  I would love to see that film that gives us real guide how to produce and plan for surgical treatment. Best option is Endoscopic cervical disscetomy at two level 4/5 and 5/6 and if either go ACDF(a nterior cervical dissectomy and fusion). But today you got again back pain and spasm of neck muscle. Meanwhile I would suggest to take muscle relaxants and neuroleptic drug and cervical traction. You can do cervical traction at home and everyday do cervical traction exercise which will prevent spasm of neck muscles.  Drugs for you:  1. Capsules  Gabapentin Actavis 300 mg, PO,after food, twice daily for one week. 2. Tablet Chlorzoxazone 500 mg three times a day for one week."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, Is there any treatment plan for stage 4 endometrium cancer with lung metastasis. The uterus is removed but it recured in the lungs (but no recurence at the surgical site). Please suggest.","Doctor":"Hello. As per the information provided it seems stage 4b of endometrial cancer. Which is clinically the last stage. In allopathy, treatment choices depend on many factors including age, associated medical conditions, the general condition of the patient and other diseases patient may be suffering from. One thing is common that surgery is not an option. The available option is chemotherapy. Many drugs are recommended for this stage including Cisplastin, Paclitaxel. Multiple drugs can be combined. Since uterus has been removed already so hormonal therapy will not help. But whether chemotherapy should be given or not, if yes then which drug to use, depending on the other factors mentioned above. If the patient's general condition is good and age is less and there are no other associated and co-existing diseases then we should consider chemotherapy. But if the age is above 60 and/or there are other co-existing diseases like diabetes or renal diseases then we should not consider chemotherapy. In Ayurveda, there are some medicines but they are not clinically proven. But in such patients basic treatment as per Doshas (Vata, Pitta, and kapha) help is giving relief and can help in decreasing clinical symptoms. Technically, I will need many details regarding his body composition and clinical symptoms before I can advise any treatment plan. Grossly, Since it is a disease originated from Vata sthana and spreaded to Kapha sthana and due to time effect usually all three doshas are disturbed. Sadabahar has been used in such cases with considerable success. Guduchi is also used. Cow urine has been proved to help in such cases. Final treatment depends on a detailed assessment of the body composition and doshas."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, My son is 19 years old and has been diagnosed with Graves' disease. He had it for nine months. He is now on 2.5 mg of Methimazole and his TSH, T3, T4 are stable. I know the disease never goes away but he is a college athlete and we need his energy back and more stable environment health-wise. One endocrinologist was saying surgery because he is an athlete and the other says radio-iodine. Not sure with sports which one is better. Please let me know which one works better for Graves'? My worries on radio-iodine are, infertility? He is only 19 years old, will it cause other cancers? Will he go bald or teeth get damaged? How much radio will he need? How often do people need two rounds? With surgery, he does not want a scar. But I am concerned about having hyperthyroidism after. What would you do surgery or radio-iodine? Please answer my concerns about both procedures.","Doctor":"Hello.  I would suggest radio ablation is the better option if he is a non-smoker, if he has no eye signs, and if the gland is not very large.  As far as your worries are concerned, 1. Fertility is no question. Yes, we suggest avoiding a baby for six months, but your son is too young to father a child.  2. Radio iodine is very specific for thyroid, so no other organ is affected.  3. Again baldness and teeth are not affected as it is not radiation therapy. It is in the form of a tablet and gets absorbed in the thyroid gland. 4. Radio ablation dose will be judged by his thyroid activity and thyroid weight. It will be around 10 millicuries. 5. In case of recurrence, or very active gland, or underdosing there can be a failure requiring repeat dosing. Surgery is not recommended until the gland is big enough to cause compression of the trachea or esophagus causing difficulty in breathing or swallowing of food."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I had intercourse with my girlfriend and it slipped. Also, my girl just started her menstrual cycle at about the same time. After about two weeks later, I noted slight wetness at the tip of my penis and had some irritation. I took Azithromycin three tablets. The irritation stopped, but slight wetness at the penis tip remained. It is very slight wetness at the tip, as during the day every few hours we go to urinate and is only on the tip. The wetness can mainly be seen in the morning when I get up after eight hours of sleep. I got blood tests and VRDL is negative. I seek your advice on medication and what could this be?","Doctor":"Hello. The wetness you are experiencing may not be an infection, it could be due to friction-related issue after intercourse causing some inflammation. As you have already run the tests and taken a course of antibiotics, there is not much to worry about. Observe the discharge for a week if it gets foul-smelling or you develop a fever or an itch over the area you may have to see the doctor. In the mean time get a urine microscopy and routine test to rule out any urinary tract infection. Avoid nylon undergarments and use cotton ones instead. Use a condom always during intercourse and make sure you do not have an allergy to latex."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, My father is 56 years old. He has diabetes for the last ten years and high BP for the last six years. Last year he had undergone angioplasty operation with two stents put in two arteries. After the initial medicines, now he has been put on Atorva 40 mg once a day, Embeta 50 mg in the morning, Ziglim-M2 in the morning and evening and Clopivas 75 mg in the evening. Earlier, Brilinta 90 mg was given, but we asked the doctor to change it as it is costly. He has been complaining of constipation for two months now, for which if he takes any medicines ease, but then again this constipation comes on and off. This complaint has raised since his operation. There is no prior history of constipation. Can you kindly suggest something for the same? Also, since the last three weeks, his sugar levels have risen to 153 mg/dL, in spite of the medicines he is taking. Please suggest.","Doctor":"Hello. I have read the history and the prescription of your father. With diabetes, hypertension, and heart problems, taking many medications and a restricted diet may cause constipation. He should eat more green leafy vegetables. He can also safely take Lactulose syrup every night 10 ml for his symptoms. It has no side effects and can be used by him. It is available in various brands like Enulose, Generlac, Kristalose. If these brands are not available, just buy him whichever brand is available in the nearby pharmacy. The drug name is Lactulose. Regarding his sugar levels, you have not mentioned whether it is fasting or after food. If the blood sugar is taken after breakfast or randomly, then the value is almost normal. No new medications need to be added. But if It was the fasting sugar value, then it is almost 40 mg too much. Taking tablet Glucophage 500 mg after lunch will reduce the levels to normal. Kindly give him this tablet along with others for 15 days and please do fasting and post prandial (one and a half hours after breakfast) and contact me."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am 46 years old and diabetic. Two weeks ago I dropped a heavy thing on my toe and now my nail looks weird and now I am having pain in my foot. I want to know whether this is gangrene or a bruise under the toenail? I am currently on Novolog.","Doctor":"Hello. I have seen the photographs. (attachment removed to protect patient identity).  The photograph sent by you shows some ecchymosis over the nail base and the adjoining skin. This is due to the weight that fell on the toe. Many patients come with similar complaints to me and most of them heal without much interventions except in those cases, where there is any fracture of toe bones (phalanges). In your case, the diabetes is what we should be careful, as it can result in infection of the ecchymosis and resultant pain in the toe as well as the foot. I suggest the following medications for you: 1. A course of antibiotics, Cefixime 200 mg twice a day after food for five days to take care of infection if it has risen. 2. Tablet Chymotrypsin-Trypsin, anti-inflammatory to reduce inflammation, edema, and swelling, take twice a day before food for three days and there after depending on the swelling take once a day. 3. Tablet Paracetamol 650 mg twice a day for pain. However, if the pain is very severe take a combination of Aceclofenac 100 mg and Paracetamol 325 mg. In the latter case, take the combination after food and an antacid Ranitidine hydrochloride 150 mg before food. 4. Do not put any tight dressing on the toe or foot and keep it elevated while on the bed. Please observe for two days following my suggestions and if you feel better then it is good. However, if the pain does not relieve or is worsening, we need to get an x-ray toe and foot done to check for any phalanx fracture. Also, we must do your complete blood count to check for any rise in the cell counts due to infection. Do take your insulin and other medications for diabetes without fail. If sugars are kept in control then it is less likely that infection will complicate. I hope this helps."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am a smoker and have been smoking for 20 years. I can feel the stress of smoke while I breathe normally. But now I have constant minor chest ache probably in the lungs. I also have been facing a problem of pain in the neck and lower pain. This increases in the night when I am lying down. Can you suggest medicine to cure my lung conditions? I am prepared to give up smoking.","Doctor":"Hello. First of all congrats on the resolve to quit smoking. Half the job is done. Now please walk the talk. The other half. Whatever damage has been done will gradually reverse back. Also, start on some breathing exercises and yoga and good healthy eating habits. Now coming to your problem, since you have have been smoking for 20 years, we must rule out any neoplasm in the respiratory pathways. For the same a chest x-ray PA (posteroanterior) view is essential. I would also suggest some blood investigations namely, complete blood count inclusive of but not restricted to ESR (erythrocyte sedimentation rate), TLC (total leukocyte count), DLC (differential leukocyte count), RBS(random blood sugar), Hb (hemoglobin), etc. Do you produce cough or sputum or blood in sputum? If so we need to take a sputum sample for AFB (tuberculous bacilli). Neck pain can be simple muscle ache or sprain. The pointers to this sort of pain are aggravation at certain positions. Relief with hot fomentation can also be pointing to such sprains. As a temporary treatment plan I am suggesting the following: 1. Steam inhalation with Karvol plus capsules in the water (similar to Vicks inhalant capsules). 2. Paracetamol 650 mg for pain relief. It can be taken twice to thrice a day depending on the pain. 3. Multivitamin tablets, to my patients I usually prescribe Supradyn tablets or Supradyn activ tablets. 4. Good nutritious food comprising plenty of green leafy vegetables and adequate amounts of proteins and energy. 5. Diclofenac gel like Voveran or Myolaxin may be applied after hot fomentation of the neck to relieve any spasm. Also with regards to your height and weight, as per what you have given, the weight is quite high. It should be brought down by 25 kg to have a healthy BMI (body mass index).

CT is a structural imaging method that relies on assessment of lymphnodes (LNs) based on their anatomy viz.size,shape, margins and enhancement patterns. Among these, size is still the most common criterion, a short axis diameter of more than 1 cm is generally accepted as a threshold for malignancy in most studies. However, the diagnostic sensitivity of this standard is weakened by the fact that many a times malignant LNs can be normal in size (false negative) and many infective nodes can be enlarged in size thus giving false positive results on imaging. Nowadays, CT is combined with PET (Positron emission tomography) to get both anatomical and functional information. It is called fusion imaging and is mainly used to diagnose and stage metastatic cancers such as lymphomas. CT also uses ionizing radiation (X-rays) that is another disadvantage which needs to be considered.  So to sum it all, structural imaging methods such as ultrasound, CT, conventional MRI do not distinguish benign LNs from malignant ones with 100 % accuracy. Conversely functional imaging methods such as DWI (diffusion weighted), PET have low spatial resolution and are time consuming. Therefore now we are seeing a shift towards fusion imaging techniques such as DWI-T2W1 MRI, PET/CT, etc., as these techniques bypass the above mentioned shortcomings."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, During masturbation I just rub the tip of the penis and not the entire penis.

One of them got the first blister of chicken pox and totally she got 30-40 blisters a few on back, hands, scalp, chest and 4-5 blisters on forehead. Now since yesterday, they have formed a scab. Second twin got the first blister on the chest five days later, and the second blister after that, a total of two blisters and till now no scab is formed. They both got vaccination when they were small. My question is whether the second twin who got only two blisters, has she got enough antibodies of chicken pox so that she is safe not to get it again in the near future?","Doctor":"Hello. You need to understand that chicken pox (varicella) vaccine does not guarantee that one would never get chicken pox. It tries to give control over it and if it fails, chicken pox occurs. Most of the times the severity is low, as the person already has pre-formed antibodies against it. As far as scab formation is concerned, they would surely appear if it is chicken pox. This is because any chicken pox infection heals by scab formation. The formation of scab may vary form person to person and in many people, they may appear late. Now, as far as your particular query is concerned, the scab formation or lesions are not markers of developing antibodies or immunity. It is usually seen that a person who develops chicken pox once does not get it again. But we have seen people and it is now well accepted, that a person who has got chicken pox once may get it again in the life time.

If you do not have severe chest congestion, he would treat you with anti-allergic drugs like Levocetirizine and Montelukast. He may add Deriphylline or Doxophylline for the chest spasms. If your chest congestion is very severe and there are wheezes and rhonchi's, then inhalers containing bronchodilators like Salbutamol would be required.

No pleasure feels when I masturbate. I hate to masturbate. Nowadays I have no sex interest. Ejaculation is not pleasurable. Please help me with this problem. I do not have any bad habit. I am fit and I sleep well, but I mastubrate twice a day. Now a days my penis is not raising when I see a girl. Please suggest recovery. And I attach a picture below to know whether my penis looks normal.","Doctor":"Hello. I have seen the pictures. (attachment removed to protect patient identity).  From your account it is clear that you do have an erection, tough it last for a shorter duration only. However, a decreased sexual interest and pleasure can be because of multiple reasons, common among them is stress and anxiety. Stress or anxiety can lead to reduced sexual performance as well as reduced penile erections. I will suggest you to not to be too worried about it and give your body some time to relax. Apart from that masturbation does not cause any harm to your sexuality. And the shape and anatomy of your penis seem to be completely adequate."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, One of my fillings broke off a week ago and the next day I was in extreme pain. I went to a dentist where she prescribed me Amoxicillin 500 mg and Ibuprofen 800 mg for seven days. A day after my medication was finished I was getting extremely sharp pain in the broken tooth and jaw, it was hot and throbbing and kept waking me up in the night. I could not put any pressure on it ans Ibuprofen did not decrease the pain at all. I finally went to the dentist for a filling unrelated to what was going on but she instead put a temporary filling on the one that is hurting. But two days later back on 800 mg Ibuprofen the pain has not stopped and it still is continuing to hurt as bad as it has before. She suggested that the molar behind the broken one needs a root canal, but I have to wait for four weeks for it to be approved. Now she is also suggesting that I get a root canal for the badly broken one to try and save it but out of the two, the broken one is causing more pain and I do not think I can wait an extra four weeks to get it approved. Should I just have that one extracted?","Doctor":"Hello. You are probably having unbearable pain due to the increasing infection below that badly broken tooth. This can be managed by opening up the infection and giving an open dressing to relieve the pain and pressure. Once opened up, the pain subsides and you can wait for another four weeks to get the root canal completed. If you think you cannot manage the pain for another four weeks, then proceed with tooth removal (for the badly broken one). But you have to get it replaced. Wish your pain comes down sooner. Hope it helps."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, My 13-year-old sister has been diagnosed with various mental disorders since the age of 2. My parents have taken her to doctors since then because they have noticed that she was not developing like the other children. Almost every doctor gave another diagnostic such as autism (each doctor suggested a different type of autism) and mental retardation. When she was approximately 6 years old, she was also diagnosed with epilepsy. At first, the crisis was happening only while sleeping and they were detected during an EEG by a doctor. He prescribed the first anti-epileptic drug which was Ospolot. My sister felt very sick from it so another doctor told us to stop the medication. We did and then she started having a different type of crisis, absence crisis while awake. The doctor then prescribed Topram. Throughout the treatment with Topram, another type of crisis was added beside the absence, that is myoclonus. The doctor then prescribed Depakine instead of Topram. The absence crisis stopped, but the myoclonus stayed. Besides Depakine, she started taking Rivotril as well. With this combination, she stopped having a crisis for 3 months, but then the myoclonus started again and nocturnal epilepsy crisis was added as well. During this period, the doctor tried to replace Depakine with Lamictal (Lamotrigine), but my sister became intoxicated from it and started suffering from the Stevens-Johnson syndrome. She had to be at the hospital for one week to detox. My parents went to a different doctor then and he added Topram (Topamax / Topiramate) besides Rivotril and Depakine. This did not work again. My sister felt very sick from this combination while having a crisis both while being awake and asleep. She was then prescribed Depakine and Levetiracetam. The crisis while being awake stopped, but those while asleep still happen. At the moment, she takes Depakine, Levetiracetam, and Ospolot, but the nocturnal crisis persists. We do not know what to do anymore because the side effects of all these anti-epileptics have done a lot of damage. My sister is always very sleepy and drooling all the time. She already has mental issues so this just makes things so much worse. I know I wrote a lot, but I thought you should have as much information as you can. Here in our place, doctors are not that well informed about these diseases, so they do not really know how to deal with it. We also cannot afford to go to other countries anymore to check with other doctors. Any advice is very welcomed.","Doctor":"Hello doctor. I read your query and understand the feeling and problems faced by you. As I can see epilepsy is the main problem at this moment and even a combination of three drugs is not making her seizure-free. Despite her treatment, she continued to have seizures and in the medical language, she is known to have refractory epilepsy. I must acknowledge here that treatment of refractory epilepsy is one of the most difficult treatment in neurology and need considerable effort on part of doctors ad family members. Despite the effort we are not 100% successful in doing so. Regarding her treatment I will like to consider one of the two below mentioned strategies. Firstly, I need to know the dosage of current medications. If there is anything that can be changed I will prefer doing so as the current three medicines are rightly prescribed. The dose can be increased or decreased for one or more drugs. My second preference will be to try Trileptal (Oxcarbazepine). This meditation is less sedative in compare to her existing treatment and a definite role in the treatment of refractory epilepsy. Before a change can be made talk to your doctor about these two options. I hope this helps you."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, For the past week or so I have been feeling a wired sensation in my right cheek sometimes on the bone other times in my mouth. I have seen my general practitioner, psychiatrist as well as eye doctor and chiropractor. They seem to think it is a combination between my anxiety and the tense muscles in my neck. I just recently had a cervical MRI for an unrelated issue and they said that the brain stem controls this area and was seen as normal on the MRI, so there is no concern.","Doctor":"Hello. I understand your concern and would explain that as long as your brain and cervical spine MRI are normal, there is no reason to panic. We can exclude MS or any serious disorders affecting the central nervous system. In my opinion, your symptoms could be related to a pinched nerve. An electrolyte imbalance can mimic this situation too. For this reason I would recommend checking thyroid hormone levels, vitamin B12 plasma levels, blood electrolytes."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, My baby is 2 years old and has plagiocephaly. Can it be cured normally?","Doctor":"Hi.  Plagiocephaly or flat head syndrome is caused when baby is kept in supine position most of the time. This usually occurs when the baby is small and it gets corrected by changing position of head frequently. In your case, the age of child is 2 years so most of the sutures in head are fused and skull bone has also formed. If plagiocephaly has persisted for so long then it is a bit unlikely that it will resolve now. However, for better judgement, I would like to see some pictures of head of child and an X-ray of head to look for sutures."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor,I am just wondering what is abutting and abutment of the nerve root means in a back issue.

I had a stroke as well that left infarcts on my left parietal lobe and caused problems with my speech and I was not able to use my cellphone correctly. Thankfully I had no lingering damage. Two months back, I had my 3 month MRI rescan and it said the artery had healed and the infarcts were smaller. I have had a sinus infection again which started about a week and a half ago with a cough again. Earlier in the week I was having on and off dizzy spells for a few days and that has passed. Now I am having sensations in the right side of my face around my cheekbone, cheek, top of right lip, around the right side of my nose. I can also feel it around my right bicep, and sometimes my right calf. There is no drooping of my smile or eyebrows. I can raise my arms without drooping. Everything seems to work correctly.

They usually go away as the illness resolve. It does not mean you have new stroke. With left parietal stroke, one can expect sensory symptoms over right side and depending on your location, body part, need to see your previous MRI which can help identify if your face region was in previous stroke region or scar tissue is there. If you are very concerned, then you can go for another MRI brain to look for any new stroke.

Two weeks ago, she had severe diarrhea and around her thighs and around her genitals, there was inflammation. The doctor says that because diarrhea is a type of virus and inflammation of the fungus. The doctor prescribed Clotrimazole and burns ointment and Yomogi. Two days later, fever started and in the body, eruptions that were in the form of fungus were released, that caused itching. The apparent shape of the grain is juicy. This time the doctor prescribed Triamcinolone ointment and syrup Amoxyclav and Hydroxyzine. According to the doctor, this virus is contagious.","Doctor":"Hi,  Welcome to icliniq.com.  I have read your question in detail and I know that you are very concerned about your child but do not worry. By what you quote it seems that your child probably has got acute gastroenteritis with inflammation at thighs and scrotal region. In my opinion, you should give syrup Ofloxacin (5 ml = 50 mg) 2.5 ml two times a day for three days and apply a Zinc Oxide cream like Rashfree cream for five days. If no improvement in 24 hours, then do a stool routine microscopy test to confirm the diagnosis. This is not viral as fever and diarrhea have been for more than 3 days.

Those spasm gets triggered when I do sudden movements like when suddenly get up from chair and start walking, I get spams. It lasts for 5 to 10 seconds. Spasms look like my legs and hands are rapidly contracting and cramping just like tetanic cramps. I consulted neurologist and he told me that those spasms are due to deficiency of vitamin D which leads to poor absorption of calcium. He has given me Vitamin D treatment for six months and told me that my spasm will completely vanish. One month has passed since I have started the treatment and I am seeing improvements. Still I get spasm but intensity has reduced. Still 5 months to go. So will I get rid of them? I am feeling anxious about them. Please give me your opinion.","Doctor":"Hi.  I must assure you that you are in right hand and right thing communicated to you about the tetanic spasms which you are experiencing for the last 15 years. Majority of patients (read all) show good response to Vitamin D supplementation when there is deficiency and same can be hoped in your case. I would like to add something at this level. Since you are taking Vitamin D but not the Calcium. This leads to inadequate calcium to absorb and low calcium and spasms.  Talk to your neurologist to add Calcium or increase at least 500 to 1000 mg per day. This will ensure that there is enough calcium to absorb since absorbing machinery is overworking due to supplementation of Vitamin D. The Calcium supplementation is likely to cut short the duration of symptoms."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am a 56 year old male. I was told that my creatinine level is 2.3 after my last HbA1c.

First of all, we need to make sure whether this rocking movement is happening, or it is just your feeling. So I advise you to ask someone to observe you and confirm whether that kind of movement is happening or not. If it is confirmed that the rocking movement is there, it indicates that there is some problem in your brain (cerebellum). It could also be due to the side effects of Lamotrigine. You have two options: 1. Either discuss with your doctor and ask for an alternative to Lamotrigine. If your symptoms disappear two weeks after stopping Lamotrigine, then it means your problem was due to the side effect of Lamotrigine. 2. Get MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) brain and revert back with the report. I hope this helps."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I had a pimple that bursts.

This will flatten out the scar to prevent the contracture. You can apply Contractubex cream four to five times a day for three months. This should solve the problem. However, the mark of the scar shall still be visible and cannot go away completely. For that, you need to undergo scar reduction surgery. We dermato-surgeons routinely perform after one year.

Below are the finding of the CT scan of the chest. Same I am uploading for details. Now thedoctor is suggesting for bronchoscopy for further diagnosis. I am not sure whether to go for it as it is an expensive process. A lot of diagnoses is already done (x-ray, tests, CT scan, etc). But I do not much faith in hospital or doctor, as I feel, he is making money from all tests and I am feeling fine, with no problem, as the problem for which I had gone to the doctor is cured. I want your advice, whether bronchoscopy is required or not? Or refer me some alternative treatment or medicine or precaution.","Doctor":"Hello,  Welcome to icliniq.com. I have seen all reports attached to your query and justify your concern about an invasive procedure like bronchoscopy. (attachment removed to protect patient identity).  The history you mentioned is quite clear but many important points are missing too. Without which it is very difficult to advise which appropriate test should be chosen next. Physical findings and clinical examination for nodes in the cervical (neck) or axillary area is very important as they can be biopsied for exact tissue diagnosis. Simultaneously tuberculin test can be done to rule out tuberculosis.  As per the CT (computed tomography) scan, you have some nodes surrounding the lungs in the hilar area. Most commonly they are due to tubercular infection. But other causes have also to be ruled out like sarcoidosis or any other infections or malignancy. As per your history, after antibiotics, you are feeling better now and do not have any other active symptoms. So it should be your clinical history and physical findings that will guide us for the next investigation to be done.  To rule out tuberculosis or sarcoidosis, we need some histological proof. So as I said earlier, if any palpable nodes are present, it should be excised for tissue diagnosis and bronchoscopy can be avoided. If no external nodes are palpable or excision biopsy is nonconclusive then the only way to get the tissue diagnosis is taking biopsy through bronchoscopy through hilar nodes. Thus once the tissue diagnosis is done, then only definitive treatment can be advised. X-ray or CT scan only shows the nodes but for tissue diagnosis, a biopsy is must. So the next investigation should be planned in the context of present symptoms and physical findings. And it is the sole decision of the treating doctor to do any invasive test if required. What I can say at the moment is any investigation is justified until definitive tissue diagnosis is obtained. So the priority is for excision lymph node biopsy and then for transbronchial or trans esophageal biopsy of hilar lymph nodes. I think the whole idea of doing bronchoscopy is clear to you now. So just follow your doctor's instructions till the tissue diagnosis is done. If you still have any doubts feel free to write to me. Tuberculin test. TB (tuberculosis) or sarcoidosis or any other infection or malignancy. As per the definite tissue diagnosis."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am out on a business trip. Yesterday, after 14 hours flight in which I wore my contacts (which are 30 days disposable Air Optix ) for about 20 straight hours, I took them out. After that, the vision in my right eye became cloudy and blurry but no pain. No issues with my left eye. It was difficult to get the contact out of my right eye. It was somewhat stuck to it. I just woke up and the vision is a little better in my right eye, not quite as cloudy and blurry (but still not normal). But now there is some pain and irritation. This is after about six hours of sleep. Is this something that warrants me getting immediately back to my place to see my eye doctor or can I wait to see him when I get back (early next week)? I do have some Prednisolone pills with me that I have been taking for a sinus infection. Presumably, those would help with the eye swelling if that is an interim option?","Doctor":"Hello. This might be due to dry eyes. The contact lens should be worn maximum for 8 to 12 hours only. The contact lens wear for a long time also cuts down the oxygen supply to cornea, which gets oxygen from the atmosphere. If the eyes are not red, discharge, watering you can continue wearing contact lens. If there are redness wear spectacles. You can use Teardrops four times a day. You can continue your treatment for sinus infection. Do as told above and let me know."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am having pain in the spine. I am taking painkillers, calcium tablets and doing exercise. I have done my HLA B27 test. Can a person suffering from ankylosing spondylitis take fat burner supplements to reduce weight? Would it have any adverse effects?","Doctor":"Hello. There is no study directly correlating fat burner supplements and their possible effects in patients with ankylosing spondylitis. Fat burner supplements often contain caffeine which reduces fat by increasing your metabolic rate. Caffeine also has an untoward effect in bones wherein the bone density reduces, a condition that we refer to as osteoporosis. Interestingly, osteoporosis is also frequently seen in patients with ankylosing spondylitis. Hence, it would be my assumption that fat burner supplements may worsen osteoporosis in patients with ankylosing spondylitis. It is always better to stick to natural methods of weight loss, and such supplements are usually discouraged. Often, FDA (Food and drug administration) finds out that some of these supplements are not adequately tested for their negative effects on health before they are made available to the public. I hope this helps."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am 18 years old. I use to sleep very much about 11-13 hours a day. I sleep late at night and wake up very late. This is creating a great hamper in my study as well as my daily life. Now, what can I do in order to get rid of this devastating problem?","Doctor":"Hello. What you are describing is a common sleep disorder known as delayed sleep phase syndrome. It is a disorder of the body clock. This clock is tuned by bright light and blue light. Chronotherapy: Sleep in a room where the sunlight will bathe your eyes in morning, even during sleep. Once awake, spend your first hour in the sun, either having tea, or reading newspaper or jogging. In short, increase the exposure to sunlight in the morning, both when you are asleep as well as awake. Do not sleep in the day at any cost. At night time, reduce your exposure to blue light emitted by TV screens, laptop, phones, etc., by 1) Minimize the usage at night. 2) Install blue light filter or flux applications in your devices. You can also use amber-colored goggles when watching TV or using a laptop, etc. 3) Have curd or a diary product at night. 4) Go to bed at the intended time, make your room completely dark, do not use the night lamp even. Use a band to cover your eyes when on the bed. Do not use your phone while on the bed. If these measures are not helpful, take Melatonin supplements like tablet Meloset 3 mg one hour before the intended time to sleep and hit the bed at the intended time to sleep. Another option if you are fine with taking medicines, is tablet Agomelatine. It makes falling asleep easy and makes you awake and alert in the day. It also has mood-enhancing property. These measures will reset your body clock and solve your sleep issue. I hope this helps."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I had an epidural injection in the left lower back for left leg pain and two months later, I am having pain in the leg and pain in right buttocks. I have been diagnosed with severe loss of disc space in L4-5. Is it unusual for this to happen? Is it logical to say that once you treated the left side that something could develop on the right side? I have done my MRI spine.","Doctor":"Hello. From what I understand, you had an epidural injection at the left L4-5 interspace, and two months later you developed a new pain on the right side, and you are wondering if the injection has anything to do with this new pain. Epidural injections are usually advised based on the side and location of your current radicular symptoms and the MRI (magnetic resonance imaging). Your physician may have suspected left L4-5 radiculopathy based on the above-mentioned findings. The effect of the medications that are injected usually lasts not more than three to four weeks. The idea is to cool down the inflammation till a time when your body can get used to the lesser space for the nerve or shrink the compressive elements with time. Since you do have a loss of disc space in L4-5, I assume your symptoms are related to spinal stenosis. Often, the symptoms begin on one side and may progress to the other side over an unpredictably long period of time. The onset of your right side pain may have been incidentally two months following your left-sided injection. I hope this helps. I will be happy to look into your MRI images to see if an epidural on your right-side L4-5 interspace may be right for you. Review MRI. Worsening spinal stenosis, L4-5 degenerative disc disease. Possible need for a right-sided epidural."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am 26 years old and I developed premature ejaculation out of nowhere around a year ago. Before that time I was the complete opposite. It used to take me too long then, I thought something was wrong with me. Now I can barely last three minutes. And it is weird because sometimes I can cum without even penetrating or touching my penis. I went to the urologist and got tested for STD, ultrasound testicle and bacterial lab test and everything came back normal. But for some reason, I feel like he has something to do with prostate or something because I have tried the cream and that did not work. So it is not a sensitivity issue, it feels like it is something going on in my penis tubes and my prostate. I think I may have prostatitis and the doctors just do not know. Please help.","Doctor":"Hello. First and foremost thing do not panic. That is the most damaging thing in your problems. Prostatitis generally does not cause premature ejaculation. Sometimes premature ejaculation can develop in case the frequency of intercourse is not much or because of stress. Symptoms of prostatitis are pain or discomfort in the urethra, discomfort in balls, lower back or lower part of abdomen, pain in thighs, painful ejaculation. Even these symptoms get aggravated by stress. PME is only a problem if it is causing distress in the relationship with your partner repeatedly. The timing of three minutes is not abnormal. So stop bothering about the timing unless it is causing a problem in your sex life. Treatment of PME is tablet Dapoxetine 30 mg SOS before sexual activity or local anesthesia (lignocaine) gels or sprays on the penis to be applied a few minutes before sexual activity. In the absence of other symptoms as mentioned above, I do not think you have prostatitis."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, How flexible should a normal person be? I have been stretching two times a week for four years and I have not improved at all. In fact, I have become worse. I do winter guard and we stretch for about 25 minutes before practice. Our show this year is called meditation and we all have to pick a yoga pose, but I cannot do most of the yoga poses because I am inflexible. I have found only two that I can do. Also, I had hip dysplasia when I was born, but I wore a Pavlick brace and they said it corrected it. Could that have something to do with it?","Doctor":"Hello. At the outset, one’s flexibility should decrease muscle soreness, prevent joint and muscle injuries, improve performance and range of motion after his/her normal physical activities. It is not important to touching the foot on the head. But you supposed to perform yogasanas as you mentioned, I give you few tips to follow. Poor postural habits and our daily movements result in reduced joint mobility. Stretching exercises improve a good range of motion and prevent joint stress injury as well. Stretching exercises gives enough relaxation both physically and mentally. 1. Take a hot full bath before starting your physical exercise. 2. Drink warm lemon honey water after 20 minutes of your bath. 3. Go for 10 minutes walk and 10 minutes jog. 4. Start your exercises with joint exercise (all joints). 5. Start stretching exercises after the joint exercise. 6. Then start suryanamaskara practice for six rounds. 7. There are so many yogic postures to improve flexibility for beginners (child’s pose, bound angle pose, fire log pose, cow face pose, downward-facing pose, extended cat pose, extended triangle pose, etc). Do practice six to ten times each and every poses daily. 8. Consult a nearby acupressure consultant to improve flexibility pressure points and reflex pressure points. 9. Less your solid intake and increase liquid diets like fruits and vegetable juices. 10. Drink hot milk with added jaggery. 11. Include flax seeds and walnuts daily. 12. Early to bed and start your practice early in the morning. 13. Avoid all kinds of stimulants. I hope your flexibility will increase soon. Follow after a month."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I am just wondering if retainers can be used to realign teeth? I have had braces off for a month and have worn mine religiously but it feels like my teeth are relapsing a little bit despite this. Is this possible? Namely, my teeth before braces were not aligned properly, had spaces, and my ortho had trouble aligning them, as they are straight but going across diagonally, but we worked on this and got it better. When my braces came off, they felt straight, I was really happy. Now, it seems like my teeth are going diagonally and not aligned anymore and is causing anxiety. I want my teeth to come straight down and not be slanted. Also, can my two front teeth be improved by filing? I have already visited my ortho once to have my essix fixed, and my Hawley's was severely tightened during that time, so I feel like contacting them just a couple of weeks later again.","Doctor":"Hello. Once the braces are removed, you have to wear the retainers for at least eight months. You have to wear them literally all the time. Else there are high chances for relapse. And yes your front teeth can be filled using tooth colored composite restoration. You just have to visit the dentist every 30- 45 days to lightly activate the retainer. Please be careful regarding this. If the teeth relapse beyond an extent, then you probably will have to restart the treatment all over again. I hope this helps."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I have gum recession due to bruxism and aggressive brushing. None of my gum measurements are over 3. Should I get a gum graft now or should I wait?","Doctor":"Hello. For further doubts consult a periodontist online -->"},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am 35 years old. I am having breast implant explantation surgery in four days. I have bad anxiety and the thought of anesthesia really scares me. I am a mother and the thought of being over sedated or not waking up at all is frightening. My surgeon has agreed to use local and MAC anesthesia, because I did not want general. Can they give me just light sedation so I am not totally out? If my surgeon would have agreed to just do local with a pain pill I would have been on board. Unfortunately, he did not go for that. I do trust my surgeon, he placed my implants almost 10 years ago and now the left implant is deflated (I have saline implants). I am also worried as when they asked if I smoked I was only thinking of cigarettes and said no. Then I called and told them I do smoke Marijuana daily. They told me to stop five days before. But I am worried now since reading online that some prefer two weeks clean. Will this cause me to be at an even greater risk now? Also, I have a minor cold and cough, no fever but coughing some sputum up. Nothing major and stopping smoking weed could be a contributing factor now. I do not smoke cigarettes or drink alcohol. I have a history of congenital cervical spinal fusion (two discs), TMJ, and anxiety, panic attacks. I exercise regularly and I am on no other prescribed medication besides Xanax 0.5 mg at bedtime which I only actually take a half tablet of when needed and that does the trick for me. I take an Emergen-C immune plus vitamin pack daily and a Stress-B complex daily (which they have not told me to stop). I am an RN and have been trying to rationalize and reassure myself that it is a common procedure and others older and in worse condition have surgeries all the time and are fine. My mind frame is so different than it was 10 years ago, where I easily trusted surgery and after augmentation was fine. I am praying daily that I will just be fine and I am over thinking everything too much. Any insight and thoughts would be wonderful.","Doctor":"Hello. It seems you are worrying a lot about small things. About the anesthesia, you need to understand the reason behind why we give GA (general anesthesia) and not local in such surgeries. The doctor is going to open the breast tissue and will be inserting the implant and then closing it carefully not to get a visible scar on the breast. If the patient moves the body by mistake, then there can be a wrong cut made on the skin or elsewhere which will spoil the purpose of beautification. To stop the movement, we give GA. If you can control your body movement, then LA (local anesthesia) might be an option. He cannot do this on a tablet for the same reason, you will move on pain and he will make mistakes. And there are no side effects for any sedation, everything gets back to normal in one day. Five days marijuana stoppage is fine. It does not cause any effects on the breast augmentation process. As long as fever is not there, there should be no problem with the cough also. I think you are all fit to go in for the surgery and I am sure you will come out of it with enhanced elegance. Just feel relaxed and do not worry about smaller issues at all. Let me know if you have any other worries and we will sort it out for your confidence booster."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor,I am just wondering what is abutting and abutment of the nerve root means in a back issue.

Then I had checked whether the cysts were dissolved by having an abdomen scan. But still, small multiple follicules have been seen in it with both ovaries enlarged. Kindly suggest me what I can do further. I got married before one and a half years and I am much worried about my pregnancy. I have gallstones as well.","Doctor":"Hello. I just read your query. See Kalarachi Kai choornam is helpful in amenorrhea. As far as small cysts are concerned they are unmatured eggs which failed to induce menstrual cycle previously, as a result, they got collected in the ovary and they will remain in the ovary. Now, you have got your periods you can start trying for conception. But I advise you to do it under the supervision of a nearby gynecologist because egg size is important while conception and that you can know by ovulation study. Ovulation study is performed under the supervision of a gynecologist. For gall stones, surgical intervention is required generally.

Can this be a sinusitis issue?","Doctor":"Hello. Sinusitis complications can result in cellulitis around the eye, pain and decreased vision. Mostly ethmoidal sinusitis can cause this problem. Internal to cheek is maxillary sinus which if infected normally does not cause visual disturbances. However, any maxillary sinus mass pushing the globe of the eye upwards can cause visual problems. To be sure of the same we need to take a CT (computed tomography) scan of paranasal sinuses to see the exact anatomy of your sinuses and also any pathology present in the same. For how long have you been having the cheek swelling? Do you have pain? Any loose tooth, painful tooth, or infected tooth? Any difficulty in swallowing or breathing? Any color change of the overlying skin of cheek? Have you suffered a sinusitis problem before? Do you get headaches or facial pains? Have you had any treatment for the same before? Regarding eye problems, I suggest you consult with an ophthalmologist in our panel for the best treatment. Meanwhile, kindly elaborate on the details I have asked you so that we can find if indeed you have a sinus problem that might be causing the blurry eye. I hope this helps. CT scan PNS (paranasal sinus). Complete blood count. Avoid dust smoke winds. Take plenty of warm water. Take food rich in all nutrients required by the body. If any previous prescriptions or hospital discharge cards or investigation reports are present, and if relevant to this problem, kindly attach those with the next query."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I have a question relating to my deceased father. I obtained his medical records after his death. While searching through his records to gain a better understanding of what may happen to me, I found he was positive for the rheumatoid factor and had been diagnosed with ankylosing spondylitis. However, the HLA-B27 gene test was negative. I brought this to my rheumatologist and she told me she thought he had something else, but would not elaborate. Does anyone have an idea of what she may thought because she still has not told me? Since then I have switched rheumatologists for that reason. My father passed away from leukemia brought on by myelodysplasia. I would like to know because doctors still have no idea what may be plaguing me. I have seen multiple doctors for my slightly high CK levels. I have been tested for myelodysplasia, rheumatoid arthritis, multiple muscle diseases, sarcoidosis, and many more. I have not received any answers as of yet.","Doctor":"Hello. Well, I do not think you should be worried about anything. Firstly rheumatoid factor is not transmitted genetically unlike HLA- B27 (human leucocyte antigen). Secondly, it can be positive in a lot of people but does not cause any symptoms. Thirdly, you have been tested so far and it has all been negative. Leukemia does carry a family history but you can get your blood checked every six months. One thing you need to understand is, there are no medications as such which can you take which can prevent autoimmune diseases. If it has to happen, it would or else not. But yes, stress would definitely make things worse. So I would suggest just take it easy since you have had negative tests and enjoy your life. Keep a regular health check. Eat healthily and exercise regularly. You have not got any answers since you are healthy. I hope this helps."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am a 20-year-old male. I have dark color in my forehead. I do not know why this happens to me? I use dye for my white hair, on behalf of this do my forehead look like this? Please suggest.","Doctor":"Hello. As you said, you have your face dark colored, it can be natural. But as you said you are in habit of coloring your hair, it can be possibly an allergic reaction to the color ingredients or the soap you are using. It can be an allergy to any cosmetic creams or powders if you are using any. You have not specified any other allergic symptoms like itching after color, or any dark colored patches anywhere over the body. Because itching anywhere on body is a sign of an allergy. So I advise you, next time when you use any colorant, always do a skin allergy test before use.  Also, do an allergy test to rule out any other allergies. Avoidance of the allergen is the best treatment of allergy. So, avoid using any creams or powders as cosmetics. Even after avoiding the allergen, you still have symptoms then you should consult a dermatologist for further evaluation and treatment.  I hope this helps. Any allergen. Skin allergy test. Antihistamines and steroids cream. Avoid cosmetic creams, powders and soaps."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am 35 years old.

See you have been a chronic smoker and even smoking tobacco less smoke cause harm to your lungs. For the sake of your better health, you need to stop smoking right away. You should also start doing spirometric exercises at home. In the market, you can easily get three-ball spirometric exercise system that is also not too costly. You should continue to do walking and jogging. Once you stop smoking you would find gradual improvement in your exercise capacity.

Thyroid peroxidase autoaby - 12.2 TSH - .70 Free-T4 - .9 Free-T3 - 3.1. She also checked my iron levels, Ferritin - 26. She has advised me that I am in the normal range and my issue is depression and I need to exercise more. She has prescribed Wellbutrin 150 mg. I understand that according to the ranges listed on the results I do fall within normal, but I seem to be on the very low end of the range. Is it possible that my thyroid is causing my issues even though they are in the normal range? Would it be worth getting a second opinion from an endocrinologist?","Doctor":"Hi. Your symptoms very well fit into thyroid problems but if the thyroid reports are normal (even if it is in the low normal range) it excludes thyroid diseases. One thing that you can do is to repeat TSH (thyroid-stimulating hormone) test after two months. But also get tested for adrenal problems by doing serum cortisol levels in the morning and evening samples. Depression could be the only cause in your case and with continued usage of Wellbutrin (Bupropion) you may notice improvement, but do get these tests and revert back.

Please suggest.","Doctor":"Hello. Many patients come to me with similar complaints. Especially during the winter season when it is windy. As per your description, you seem to suffer from bronchitis. The presence of thick phlegm indicates it is a bacterial infection. The values of hemoglobin, ESR (erythrocyte sedimentation rate) and TLC (total leukocyte count) are within normal limits. Absolute eosinophil count (AEC) is slightly towards the higher side. High AEC is mostly due to the infection that you are suffering from. For these complaints, I would suggest a course of antibiotics which have good action on the respiratory system, a course of anti-inflammatory tablets, mucolytics and antihistaminics for a week. During the course of treatment please refrain from smoking, going out in dusty weather, drinking or eating spicy, cold, and oily foods. Take steam inhalation thrice a day and drink plenty of warm water. A small chance is that it could be due to asthma or allergy.

Also during this summer, I was told by my doctor that I tested positive for Chlamydia. A day after my doctor's visit, I noticed that on the left part of my upper lip, there seems to be like a rise in the skin. There are no bumps, no burning, or no itching. I have become very stressed about this because as I examined the lips of others, that part of my lip was starting to look strange compared to others. My partner and I both got our treatment for Chlamydia and waited seven days before having sex again. Now I am experiencing a couple of things that I was not before. My partner is not experiencing anything. I noticed that I was experiencing some itching in my vaginal area (at the top where hair grows). It is not a cluster of bumps, but it is white and very noticeable to the naked eye. I am thinking that it is just public lice but not so sure. Next, I have noticed that I have what feels like two cuts (one on each side) near the bottom of my vaginal area. It does not burn or itch, it is just there. I have experienced some smelly discharge but not a lot. I have not been with anyone else except the same guy I had from the summer. Can you tell me if I might have a certain virus or infection?","Doctor":"Hello. I have read your query. Chlamydial infection is the most common sexually transmitted infection worldwide. You had been advised to take antichlamydial treatment for both the partners and you have taken treatment for the same. But the abstinence period is usually two to three weeks after treatment before any sexual intercourse. Since you are experiencing a mild amount of foul-smelling discharge which is usually present in the chlamydial infection. You are supposed to look to a doctor in your area for the treatment for the specified time and work out on the abstinence period.

So the doctor prescribed DV 60K once a week for two months and then once in a month. I am having this medicine for three months. I was fine and had no pain. Now already I took 15 pills in a period of three months. Now I am having pain all over the body. Hand pain, joint pain, and lower leg pain, even I took rest but it is still there. I did blood work. Everything looks fine and within normal range except high cholesterol. My calcium level is good 10.1 mg/dl. I feel tired and fatigued all the time. I got watery stools for the past three months, I know this is not diarrhea. My stool is clear and no WBC in it. My urine is clear. I got a gland on the floor of teeth and a small lymph node in the neck. I completed an antibiotic course for it, but they are not going to its original size. My question is why am I having pain all the over the body even when I am having a high dose of vitamin D (DV 60K)? My calcium level is good but why I feel bone pain? Why I am having watery stools? I am vitamin D deficient so do I have cancer?","Doctor":"Hi. See muscle pain or joint pains, watery motions are some of the side effects of vitamin D. These symptoms can also be seen in thyroid problems or diabetes. You have mentioned that your blood reports are fine, but have you been tested for thyroid and diabetes?

You should get an ECG (electrocardiogram) done, which may or may not pick these disturbances as these are intermittent. So, 24-hour Holter monitoring may be necessary. Alternatively, you may wear smart watches with ECG monitors like Kardia monitor or other smart watches. They can guide us regarding the heart rhythm during symptoms and clinching the diagnosis. So, there is a possibility of cardiac disturbance, which are not usually worrisome but we need ECG to confirm the exact cause. I hope this helps you and get back if you have any doubts."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, My mother, 72 years old, is having intermittent frontal, occipital and parietal upper sinus pain and pressure with dizziness. I took her to the ER last week because she was having dizziness with blurred vision and the pain. They did a CT scan and it came back negative of any lesions. What can I do to help her? We tried several OTC medications- nothing. The ER doctor prescribed Meclizine 12.5 mg for her dizziness, however the medication makes her feel like she is \\"out of her body' and real drowsy and fatigued. She has a follow up appointment with her primary doctor tomorrow.","Doctor":"Hello. I am giving you some suggestions in the wake of the conversation we had. The symptoms are not classical of ENT sinus headache. It appears more towards neurological. Meclizine is a strong antihistaminic with anti-vertigo properties based on its central nervous system depressant actions. Some people develop hallucinations with the drug. Perhaps your mother also developed the same. Stop the drug. For vertigo administer her Betahistine tablets. 16 mg tablet thrice a day and start tapering after four days. I suggest you give her a course of antibiotics after discussing with your physician to remove any focus of infection that could be present in the sinuses causing pressure and headache. Also try steam inhalation as frontal sinus headaches tend to get relieved by steam. Kindly consult with an ENT surgeon and a neurologist as further consultations. An ENT specialist can help rule out sinus headaches, ENT infections or ascertain ENT cause for vertigo. If no such cause found a neurologist can help find out the cause. Show the neuro your CT report."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor,I am just wondering what is abutting and abutment of the nerve root means in a back issue. Please explain.

I do not know why this pain is happening and I have never experienced anything like it before. My period was due and I am a few days late this time. I have not tested for pregnancy yet. Today I started spotting some pink discharge and a very small amount red blood. It was not in the underwear and I found it only when I wipe. I am getting concerned and do not know what is going on. Could this just be early pregnancy? Or is it something worse?","Doctor":"Hi. Well, firstly I would like you to get a blood test done to rule out pregnancy. It is serum beta hCG. You must also get a vaginal ultrasound done urgently. The reason I am asking for these tests is either you could be having these symptoms because of an ectopic pregnancy or an ovarian cyst. The pain may be an indication of the process of either expelling out from one side of the tube or rupturing and thinning of the tube. The more serious of the two situations is the possibility of ectopic pregnancy, which can be ruled out by the tests. If it is a cyst, then it can usually be made out by an ultrasound.

They are not crystal floaters but appear in bright sunlight as transparent dark lines and in dimly lit rooms, when they move over light, they appear white. A couple of days ago I was driving at night and might have seen a flash, but it also could have been lightning in the sky off in the distance but I am not sure. Since then I have not seen any obvious flashes but have been questioning whether I am seeing small, barely visual ones.

I will definitely pay out of pocket for an exam if scheduling sooner could save my vision.","Doctor":"Hello. I reviewed your history. The symptoms of flashes of light with the presence of floaters along with the history of diabetes require evaluation. Waiting for two and a half weeks will be too long considering your profile as you are having type 1 diabetes. Five years is the time period we give for the screening of diabetic retinopathy in type 2 diabetes, but in type 1 there is no time frame as such and this can occur early also.

These exercises will stretch all muscles of your body.

The symptoms are mostly neurological, eyesight, fatigue, depression, anxiety, and nausea. I am currently taking 500 mg Depakote ER and 150 mg Lamictal ER daily for seizures and have been taking them for several years now. My questions are not related to my medications necessarily. I am wondering if it is possible for the body to absorb heavy metals like lead, thallium, mercury and cadmium for example from new body piercings, specifically earlobe piercing, if the needle or jewelry is dirty or has toxic metals in them. I have been chronically exposed to puncture wounds with needles that could potentially have toxic metals in them for many months and I am worried that I may be poisoned. What should I do? More details about the presenting complaint: The symptoms were sudden and stronger originally than they are currently but I still have symptoms. The symptoms started a few months back. I had several puncture wounds before that. Previous history of the same issue: I have never experienced these symptoms before. Current medications: Depakote and Lamictal.

Lab tests performed: I had a lead blood test and a metals acute poisoning panel blood test a few days ago but I do not have the results yet.","Doctor":"Hi. The mentioned symptoms might be due to the antiepileptic drugs also, so do not confuse too much. Due to climate change, changing the brand, stress level, changing dietary patterns all can facilitate antiepileptic drugs to produce the above symptoms. Consume more fresh fruit juices three to four times in a day, that will make you fresh.  Once you get a blood test report, you may know whether there is heavy metal poisoning. If it is positive, do not worry, there are better chelating drugs to remove metals from body.

Maintain a proper posture of your back while working and sleeping.

Swine flu is caused by a virus called H1N1 and H3N2 group of influenza viruses that are widespread across continents. Since they spread by aerosols, which means that a person having swine flu can spread it by just sneezing and coughing and people around can get infected by inhaling the droplets in the air coughed or sneezed out. Vaccination is one of the effective ways of preventing swine flu although it may not be 100% effective. Get yourself vaccinated before the onset of the flu season every year. If you are an asthmatic or having chronic respiratory problems it is all the more recommended to get yourself vaccinated for flu. The best treatment is prevention, by maintaining hand hygiene, cough etiquette, i.e. covering one's mouth and nose while coughing and sneezing and turning away from surrounding people, frequent hand washing. Once you suspect that you have flu, take adequate rest, hydrate yourself, seek medical help as soon as possible."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor,I am just wondering what is abutting and abutment of the nerve root means in a back issue.

Doctor send me home with no brace and asked me to just take it easy. They advised me not to lift heavy weight and it will heal in six weeks. I am feeling good but there is a little sore. I did not have any pain killers for three days now. Will they heal like a normal fracture?","Doctor":"Hello, Welcome to iclniq.com. You have mentioned a car accident about a week ago in which you fractured T2 and T4 vertebrae. For any spinal fracture, opinion is based upon: 1) Detailed neurological examination of the patient. 2) x-ray and if needed MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) of the involved region of the spine to know the status of the bony alignment and the spinal cord. Since you have been advised six weeks of light work, not lifting any heavy weight, etc, it appears that you just have a very minor crack of the involved vertebrae. But I will reserve my opinion once I have all the information in the form of clinical examination findings and related investigation reports. Also if the fracture is minor or undisplaced then sometimes doctors do not prescribe braces because rib cage provides enough splintage. Car accident. X-ray and MRI dorsal spine with images. Rest or mobilization with a brace (further opinion reserved until I can see the fracture configuration). Do not bend forwards acutely. Do not lift any heavyweight. Follow up after three to four weeks with x-ray images."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, So for the past couple of weeks, I have been very itchy and will break out in little bumps. I went to the doctor to find out if it was an allergic reaction or something else but they were not very helpful. They prescribed me Desonide for the breakouts. I have been using it but it has not helped with the itching. I also talked to a pharmacist and she asked if I had ever had experience with eczema and I did when I was a baby, but I thought I had grown out of it. She recommended me taking Claritin for the itching and using a moisturizing lotion and to continue using the Desonide. I have been doing this for a couple of days and I am still itching like crazy. I do not know what else to do.","Doctor":"Hello. I have read your query. Profuse itching over your body leading to a little red bumps could be an urticaria or an allergic reaction. Since it is from two weeks it can be acute urticaria. Urticaria uaually comes down in 24 - 48 hours to appear in other areas. These can also be called as hives. Complete blood count along with differential count IgE (immunoglobulin E). Acute urticaria. Anti-pruritic creams like Sarna or Ritch cream. Can use steroid like Mometosone if the itching is persistent over the area. If there are too much of red bumps and itching is not controlled you can use a low dose oral steroid Prednisone 5 mg for a week along with oral antihistaminics Hydroxyzine 10 mg in the night and Fexofenadine 120 mg in the morning time."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I have noticed two marks on my labia. They neither cause me pain or discomfort. I have labeled them in the photo. I believe one of them is an ingrown hair. I am not sure what the second is? I did not have sex for a few weeks and while doing sex I used a condom with the same partner. I am wondering if this looks like herpes or HPV? Does this look like an std? Is this a concerning presentation of my labia?","Doctor":"Hi. I have gone through your history and picture and understand your concern. (attachment removed to protect patient identity).  These spots could be due to inflammation or a simple fungal or bacterial infection. Apply some ointment on it and keep watch on it (size, color, and pain). I hope this helps."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am 29 years old. What would be the specific symptoms of alcoholic neuropathy? I am having some nerve issues, they conducted two separate neurological exams (no conductivity testing just the general exam) but the neurologist did not find anything abnormal. I am a mild to moderate drinker and have been drinking for about six years. I do not binge drink or drink more than a glass or two of alcohol every other day or so. I eat very healthfully and work out. I have had all sorts of bloodwork and nothing has come up (Ac1, B12, thyroid, etc.). My MRI is scheduled in five weeks to rule anything else out.","Doctor":"Hello. I read carefully your question and would explain that your symptoms are not typical of alcoholic neuropathy. Anyway, tremor is very common after years of alcohol intake. I would first recommend checking vitamin B1 plasma levels and vitamin D plasma levels for possible deficiency. I agree with your neurologist, on the fact that when reflexes are present we can exclude peripheral neuropathy. But sometimes, single-fiber EMG (electromyography) would give more information on possible small fiber neuropathy. In the meantime, I would recommend taking magnesium supplements in order to help to improve your situation. You should discuss it with your doctor on the above tests. I hope this helps."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I have been suffering from recurring tonsillitis since I was a child. I was told at one point that if I was to be diagnosed with tonsillitis again, I would have to schedule to get my tonsils removed. However, I have had it quite a few times since. I also suffer from frequent tonsil stones accompanied by pus, or just pus all together. It is really been a bother as I am becoming older and I am tired of frequent emergency room visits ending in the same treatment. The pain and severe swelling have been going on for two days now. My right tonsil, however, always appears to be swollen. I also have mucous in my nose that is draining from the back. Nothing is coming from my nostrils themselves. I am taking over the counter Chloraseptic for the pain, but it is not working. Along with vitamin C packs and cough drops. I visited my previous doctors a few months ago, they gave me a shot of penicillins and two other shots that I cannot remember.","Doctor":"Hello. Your tonsils are definitely infected. You need a course of antibiotics, decongestants, pain killers and good gargles. Additionally, we need to have a look at your nose to rule out if there is any rhinitis or sinusitis that is triggering the tonsil infections repeatedly. I would suggest a Z Pak 500 mg for you take it for five days one tablet once daily. If that is not there get Claritin. Take Sudafed and Deslor (Desloratadine) once a day. Get Benzydamine gargles and mix it with water and gargle thrice. Take Tylenol (Acetaminophen) as per pain. Since you are saying you got thick post nasal drip I would suggest some mucolytic and nose drops as well take it for four days. Otrivin and Mycinex would do. Once the current infection subsides I would want you to get a nasal endoscopy and CT (computed tomography) scan of nose and PNS (paranasal sinus) to rule out sinonasal problems. Do revert back for further help and guidance."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, My husband has been feeling fatigued for the last six months with disinterest in activities.

Please check those and let me know what is the problem with him.","Doctor":"Hi. I have seen the reports. (attachment removed to protect patient ability).  Based on your query, my opinion is as follows. Blood smear appears macrocytic with ovalocytes suggesting vitamin B12 and folic acid deficiency. Few macro platelets are also noted, which is in line with vitamin B12 and folic acid deficiency. It could be possibly early stages as the hemoglobin level is normal. The lipid profile is a bit abnormal. Weight reduction with diet should be adequate. No medications necessary for now. Repeat after six months to check any improvement. Liver function tests show borderline abnormality. If any specific cause like alcohol or obesity present, it requires correction. Otherwise, not to be worried for now. The thyroid profile is near normal. Nothing to suggest thyroid cause. Requires improvement of nutrition, particularly vitamin B complex supplements. Also good hydration at least six to eight liters of water per day, along with moderate activities and protein-rich diet are necessary. No particular cause present in the tests conducted for any fatigue.

We are planning for a child but cannot get success. We have sex regularly. Now I have some doubts please clarify me in detail. I am over weight (pear-shaped). My height is 156 cm and weight is 68 kg. For my height and age, the ideal weight is only 50 kg. I am following a healthy diet by reducing the carbs and increasing the fiber and others. I am doing the walking and some low intensity exercise like squats but my relations compelled me to leave it as it will cause miscarriage. Whether my over weight cause any problem in my pregnancy? Does this irregular period affect pregnancy? I had a fungal infection in my vagina before marriage. I took tablets, I have more other problems that the black skin in that area.

We have more foreplays after these 25 days and also we have tried some other position like doggy, cowboy, etc. earlier it was only a missionary position. Does it have any problem? Do I have to go to the gynecologist? Do traveling in car or jumping affects pregnancy? After intercourse, the sperms leak out of my vagina. My hubby feels like every thing ejaculated has leaked out. Is it usual or not even after doing in the tilted position it leaks out. What is the solution? The society makes us so confused all are giving advices. So we need proper guidance. Please help us.","Doctor":"Hi. Being overweight or obese definitely increases complications during pregnancy like abortion, low growth of baby, development of diabetes and hypertension. It is better to attempt weight reduction (if possible) before achieving pregnancy. Irregular periods, if it is between 25 and 35 days normally it does not affect the pregnancy, as such cycles are generally ovulatory. The black marks are less likely to be due to fungal infection. Those generally indicate insulin resistance in obese individuals. They may disappear slowly once you lose weight. Itching is not normal, need to check once with a gynecologist to rule out infection. Normally, foods are not known to affect the chance of pregnancy. Just do not take an overdose of nutritional supplements, as it may affect baby if you conceive. Slight rise in temperature normally occurs due to the hormonal effect and is considered normal. Slight pain after intercourse is no problem and needs no treatment. Traveling in a car or jumping does not affect pregnancy. Just do not try vigorous exercises in the first three months of pregnancy. Normally, semen leaks out after intercourse and there is nothing to worry, as what leaks out is generally plasma, sperms normally go into the uterus immediately after deposition in the vagina. Still, if you are worried, you can keep one or two pillows below your hip to keep the semen inside for the longer duration. Apart from those answers, we normally do some tests for women who are trying for pregnancy. Those are hemoglobin, random blood sugar, TSH (thyroid-stimulating hormone), Rubella IgG (to know immunity against rubella), HIV, HBsAG (surface antigen of hepatitis B virus). You can get those done if interested. These are to safeguard your baby. I hope this helps."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, My question is about a septoplasty operation for anesthesia. Doctor says I need this operation but I am scared of the anesthesia. Mostly scared about awareness and being paralyzed. Can someone give me a brief summary of drugs used during general anesthesia for a septoplasty? Is it possible to not be given a muscle relaxant, or paralyizng drug? If I were to be given a paralyzing drug how long would it last?","Doctor":"Hello. First of all, you need not get scared about getting general anesthesia for your surgery (septoplasty). For your surgery, general anesthesia is the best option for anesthetizing you. One more point is that you need not be afraid about awareness and being paralyzed since your anesthetist will administer drugs at the correct dose which will prevent you from having awareness during surgery. While administering general anesthesia, the anesthesiologist would be administering drugs (eg. Propofol) which will first put you into a deep sleep, further he may also administer opioids (eg. Morphine) so that you would not be having pain during and after surgery. Thirdly, he would also add an inhalational agent (eg. Sevoflurane) to keep you in deep sleep (anesthesia) so that you will not be aware during the whole period of surgery. For septoplasty, administering muscle relaxants for putting an endotracheal tube into your trachea for administering anesthesia is one of the safe options for administering anesthesia. I would advise you to have less anxiety about muscle relaxants since it is best to have it for our surgery. most of the anesthesiologists are experts in using muscle relaxants for administering general anesthesia so the complications due to muscle relaxants are very less in experienced hands. There are different muscle relaxants based on their duration of action. Your anesthesiologist would be using the right muscle relaxant (usually drug will of short duration) for you. Once the surgery is over, the effect of muscle relaxant will also be over based on its duration of action. The anesthesiologist will administer an antidote type of drug to reverse the effect of muscle relaxant. Relax before you go for surgery, do not worry about the complications due to anesthesia like awareness and muscle relaxant. Your anesthesiologist will administer safe general anesthesia for you."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I have gained 50 lbs in the last six months. I have pitting edema in my legs, ankles, and feet, by the end of the day my feet and ankles are severely swollen and the skin feels stretched. When I go to squat down my legs feel like a balloon that is about to burst. My arms and hands are swollen, I have a ring that I used for eight years and used to be loose on my finger, but now I cannot even get it on my finger. I am so fatigue every day, no matter how much sleep I get. My eyes feel heavy, I find myself nodding off at work. I do not ever feel like hanging out with my friends even. I have major mood swings. I cry about things that normally would not make me cry. I get really uncontrollable anger and find myself wondering why I am so angry but I just cannot seem to control it. I have had very little interest in sex with my boyfriend and I live together and we went three months without sex because I just have not had the interest in it, or felt like I do not have the energy to actually have sex. I get occasional tingling in my hands. I will be sitting and doing my makeup and my hands will start to feel a tingle. Or I will be driving to work and my hands will feel almost numb sometimes. I am so thirsty all the time and I am one of those people who drink the recommended amount of water daily. I am now snoring when I sleep which I never have before. And I feel like I sleep so deeply. Every little noise used to wake me up and now I sleep through really loud thunderstorms, etc. I have battled insomnia for a number of years but now my body is at the extreme opposite. I sleep, but I do not feel rested. I cannot seem to control my own body temperature. I am either burning hot or freezing cold, I cannot ever just be comfortable. Especially at night, I do not even sleep with a blanket and I do not even put the sheet over my legs because my legs especially get unbearably hot. There are a plethora of other random, seemingly unrelated issues, but I will not take up your time with all of those. I have seen my primary care concerning all of these issues and despite my TSH being 5.73 two weeks ago. He was hesitant to call my hypothyroid and still referred to me as sub clinical despite the fact that I am extremely symptomatic. At my urging, he repeated my TSH two days ago and it came back a 3.0. But I know that there is new research showing that anything above 2.0 can be considered hypothyroid when there are symptoms associated. My T3 was 246. My FT4 was 1.1 and I have not gotten my anti-TPO antibody back yet. The basic metabolic panel came back fine-kidneys, liver and heart all checked out fine too. My BP was high 154/93 mmHg when I had an ER visit two weeks ago and then again with my PCP ten days ago, but was back to normal 118/69 mmHg in this most recent visit. I am frustrated because I am almost certain it is Hashimoto's, or possibly even Cushing's disease. PCP ran a random cortisol urine test which came back normal, but I know that test is not exactly the gold standard for Cushing's diagnosis. But my PCP seems completely unconcerned and seems to want to diagnose me as depressed or having some other psychiatric disorder that I do not feel is appropriate. I am the happiest I have ever been with my life right now, I cannot imagine I would be depressed. My gut tells me its thyroid, or something else endocrine-related. The fatigue is worse every day. I am currently taking Ocella. Please help.","Doctor":"Hello. Well, your weight gain is most probably due to fluid retention in the body and it is the same fluid retention that is causing edema of your legs, arms, and hands. The cause for this fluid retention could be low protein levels, kidney problem or heart problems. I would advise you the following tests: 1. Serum creatinine.  2. Liver function test.  3. 2D echo. Now coming to your fatigue, thirst and tingling sensation it could be due to diabetes, Vitamin B12 and D3 deficiency. Hence, I recommend you to get tested for the above conditions. Coming to your snoring and feeling unrest even after sleep. Probably you might be having a condition called sleep apnea syndrome where you may having obstruction to airflow during sleep causing repeated, transient choking spells and hence you snore and feel drowsy after you wake up. This condition can be confirmed by doing a test called sleep study. Kindly get it done and revert back. The main cause for the Sleep Apnea syndrome is you being overweight. So kindly start reducing weight. As your thyroid is considered you do not have hypothyroidism. But yes Cushing's is a possibility and you are right. You need to get serum cortisol tested at 8 am and 4 pm. But kindly get the other tests advised by me also and revert back. I hope this helps."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am a 47-years-male. I am still unmarried and virgin. I am struggling with a humiliating problem and unable to contact any andrologist directly. Hence, I am humbly requesting your kind help with your valuable advice. When I was 27, I was unable to get sexual erection though impulse was there. I contacted a local urologist, he gave me Papaverine injection to my penis and advised to use Libidol tablets at that time. I did not find any improvement. Later, I approached a famous sexologist in our city. He said nothing is wrong in me and wrote Mustang, Alprazolam and Fluoxetine tablets. Accordingly, I used, but no result I observed. My sister is a gynecologist and I gone through her old medical books for sexual impotence and gathered some information on various tests. Later, when I was 29 years, again I met the same urologist and expressed my willingness to go for a Doppler ultrasound test and attended, which revealed that there was arterial insufficiency. Basing on the report, the urologist suggested me to go to a particular place to approach famous andrologist there. I went and met the andrologist. He conducted the Rigiscan test for two days and gave Prostaglandin E1 to my penis and injected some distilled water into my penis through the machine for maximum enlargement of the penis and suggested me to use simply Nuzak capsules (Fluoxetine content) without saying any further. Again I approached our local famous sexologist and showed the reports. He said nothing wrong with me. I asked him whether to go for hormonal tests also. Based on my interest, he suggested me to go for FSH, LH, serum prolactin and testosterone tests. In that hormone test, he identified that the serum prolactin level is more than the specified range (around 1%) and hence suggested me to use Proctinal tablets half tablet a day for 30 days. I followed his instructions accordingly and after some time, I observed good and long-lasting erections and maximum enlargement of the penis when attained erections. Sometimes, due to foreskin, a little bit of discomfort also caused when penis maximum enlarged due to erection. I used to get excellent erections both day time and night time. As I said, still I am a virgin and whenever I failed to control myself, I used to do masturbation. But within 30 minutes, I used to get excellent erections further. This was happened until I attained 43 years. Later, there is a gradual change and now not getting day time erections and during night sleep. I observed though there is an erection, I am getting around 50% hardness only and not getting good erection and maximum enlargement of penis as earlier. I do not have any sugar or BP issues. I never took alcohol and I am purely vegetarian. Now I am getting pressure for marriage. I am unable to take a decision whether to go for or not keeping in view the sexual erection problem. I do not know whether I can make happy of my lady and give birth to a child. I saw that Aswagandha capsules boost sexual erections and hence using for the past one month. Also read in websites that horny goat weed (750 mg) with maca (150 mg) also gives good results in correction of erectile dysfunction and hence, recently bought one and using for the past one week one tablet per day. Some websites also suggesting to use Pycnogenol with L arginine for good erections. However, I would like to have a specialist consultation. Hence, could you please help me by guiding the way I have to follow to get rid out of this embarrassing problem? Also, suggest to me whether horny goat weed with maca is good or bad. If any medication is suggested, I can follow it. Earlier, I gone for self hormonal tests and found all FSH, LH, serum prolactin and testosterone were within the normal range. If you need any more clarification, I can provide you. Could you please also guide me till what age, a person gets strong erections to perform sexual inter course?","Doctor":"Hi. I have read through your query in detail. Please find my observations below. The normal prolactin levels in males are 2 to 18 ng/mL. If your latest prolactin levels are in normal range then it is acceptable. You have mentioned earlier that there was arterial insufficiency due to which there was no proper erection. It is important to know if there is any persisting arterial insufficiency right now. If it is found then this should be treated first. Surgical treatments are available but non-surgical treatments should be first applied. Following treatment guidelines might be of help to you. Please note that every treatment might not bring about a good results in every patient and one or more treatment options should be used to watch for positive outcomes. The treatment for erectile dysfunction is the following. 1. Life style changes including a healthy diet, free from mental stress and avoiding alcohol and smoking. 2. Physiotherapy and sex therapy (this is only for those who are in a relationship). 3. Any androgen deficiency due to age is to be corrected. For this testosterone levels are to be measured and medicines like L-carnitine or DHEA (dehydroepiandrosterone) are given. 4. Phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5) inhibitors like Sildenafil, Vardenafil or Tadalafil might show positive results when given in the recommended dose. 5. If there is hyperprolactinemia then medicines are there to reduce prolactin level. 6. If above does not work then intracavernosal injections might help under medical supervision. 7. The transurethral administration of Alprostadil (Prostoglandin E1) gel also helps many patients. 8. There are special vacuum devices which can be used with intracavernosal injections or PDE 5-inhibitors. 9. Ligation of penile veins and arterial revascularization are the surgical methods used. It is important to know that please try the above methods of treatment under medical supervision one at a time and know which is the most suitable treatment. The sexual performance of a male decreases after 40 years and is more on decline after 60 years. At 47 years, you should get a semen analysis done to know the quality of sperms produced and if it is favorable for pregnancy. The choice of adoption of children is always there if you are not able to have children in the natural method. I hope this helps."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I had a smoking history of three years. Three months back there were a few blood drops were there in the phlegm while clearing the throat. Out of curiosity I had few like chest x-ray, chest CT scan with contrast (lymph nodes were there but in CT reports it was written like no significant lymph were seen), and PFT. All tests are normal. I have a few questions which are striking me. What is the accuracy of chest CT? Do this really rule out the probability of something like lung cancer? There is no weight loss but some chest congestion is there. I am feeling difficult to breathe and I am having heavy breathing. What can be this if my PFT is clear? Can this be lung cancer? Do I need to test further? Please suggest.","Doctor":"Hello. After going through your case, I do not think there is something to worry about the possibility of lung cancer as it can be just a smoker's bronchitis. As you said, you do not have any symptoms at present and all the tests including x-ray CT (computed tomography) and PFT (pulmonary function test) are within the normal range, there is nothing to worry about. The chest congestion blood flecks in phlegm and breathing difficulty you suffer are because of underlying bronchitis due to smoking. As far as investigations like CT scan and x-ray are concerned, they are very accurate in finding out the underlying abnormality. So no need to doubt even x-ray and CT are normal. The most important thing now is how to prevent further damage to the lungs and restore normal breathing. For that, I strongly recommend you stop smoking right now. Smoking cessation is the only way to improve your lung health. You can take the help of your family doctor in smoking cessation. If you find it difficult, he may prescribe you some medicine. I would advise you to do some exercises on a daily basis or gym as per your schedule as it would boost your stamina and exercise tolerance also. So all the best and do not be anxious about lung cancer but stay determined to quit smoking. Smoking. Bronchitis. Quit smoking, Nicotine chewing gum."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am suffering from psychosis, anxiety, depression and panic disorder which used to be at its peak before few months.

And also I want to know how to use nicotex? I was recommended to take after every two hours gap, but I want to know for how many minutes it should be chewed? Will this be helpful?","Doctor":"Hello. Now, have you been diagnosed with psychosis, anxiety, panic disorder, and depression? What were the other medicines apart from nicotex gums which were prescribed to you? Was any improvement noted after taking those medicines? Now, solving your doubt. Nicotex can be taken as many times as you would take a cigarette or whenever you had a desire. Cigarettes contain harmful chemicals apart from nicotine whereas, nicotex contains only nicotine which is not so harmful to lungs. You can safely take nicotex gums. If ECG (electrocardiogram) is normal then no major issues with heart are likely. Your symptoms appear to be because of anxiety more than due to nicotine. You chew nicotine as long as it loses its taste. Let me know about your symptoms more so that I can help you more."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am a 29-year-old female.

Vertebrae has a central canal where the nerves from the brain run to reach the legs. At each vertebrae level, there is a shock absorber called the disc. Often this gets displaced due to the pressure put on it and it starts to put pressure on the nerves that run down the leg leading to what is called sciatica. You have a disc between number 4 and 5 vertebrae that is the source of your pain in the legs more so than your spine and lower back. You have not sent me the films for me to judge the actual size of the disc, not everyone requires surgery. You should be on Pregabalin 75 mg twice a day. You should be having physiotherapy or chiropractic treatment which seems to be working. If a good trial of six weeks to three months is over and you have more leg symptoms than back, then you need attention surgically."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I saw today that my husband has this vascuar lines and petechias in his middle back but I could not do a diagnosis. I am a general physician but not a dermatologist. Is this condition a vasculitis or something I should worry about?","Doctor":"Hi. I have observed the picture and also gone through the history of present and past illness (attachment removed to protect patient identity). I could observe that there is tendency for the lesions to assume a shape that is generally seen due to excoriation. This implies that the primary lesion or symptom induces the subject to scratch resulting in this picture. Vasculitis tends to be diffuse and involves various body areas and more so on the dependent parts like lower legs and feet. Most such patients tend to spontaneously recover over time. However, an attempt must be made to find out whether any local factor might be operative like an insect or bug bite, postural pressure on the area, any disorder that would cause itching like heat rash or an allergy to some agent that is off and on applied to this part of the body.The petechiae seem to have resulted from scratching. Careful observation leads one to the cause in good number of cases. For symptomatic relief, one can consider giving anti-allergic medications."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, Can you please provide me with your opinion on a white patch under my tongue. It does not rub off and just noticed it a few days ago. I am currently on Losartan 100 mg.","Doctor":"Hello,  Welcome to icliniq.com.  I understand your concern and saw your clinical pictures. (attachment removed to protect patient identity).  These pictures look a little blurred and a clearer picture will make the diagnosis easier. It could be a drug-induced lichenoid reaction or lichen planus probably caused by Losartan. Generally, anti-hypertensive drugs such as this are known to cause lichenoid reactions and lichen planus when medicines are taken for longer periods. Please look for skin lesions also. And visit the dentist, if required the doctors may advise you to go for a biopsy procedure. On clinical examination and with biopsy, it is easier to diagnose and the cause can be determined. If it is drug-induced, the offending drug will be stopped and will be replaced by another one. If the cause is idiopathic (of unknown origin), then it can be managed with a topical corticosteroid cream.  I hope this helps."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I am a 26 year old male.

Snoring can be a serious concern to the sufferer as well as the spouse or partner due to the disturbance. It causes a lot of agony and affects one's mental peace. Snoring is due to some obstruction in the upper pathways of breathing, the upper respiratory tract. The levels can be: 1. Nose : nasal polyp, deviated nasal septum.  2. Nasopharynx : nasopharyngeal growth, cyst, mass.  3. Oropharynx : thick tongue, tonsillar enlargement, thick palate.  4. Lower down : lingual tonsils.  The mode of treatment for snoring depends on the level of obstruction. Also, snoring without obstructive sleep apnea is a harmless condition except for the disturbance it causes. Obstructive sleep apnea on the other hand causes changes in the circulatory system and causes increased effort by the heart to pump blood. It can result in hypertension and can be aggravated by lifestyle diseases also.  It is important to find out if you suffer from obstructive sleep apnea. We need more details as to your quality of sleep, disturbances, lifestyle, occupation, body weight, habits, etc., to arrive at a more decisive diagnosis and give you the right advice. Mode of treatment include medical, surgical measures. A machine called C-pap is very effective to remove the obstruction. Various lifestyle modifications and dietary changes are also necessary in the management of snoring."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor,I am just wondering what is abutting and abutment of the nerve root means in a back issue.

Has been this way for about 3 to 6 years. I have tried skin whitening, and dark spot corrections, even skin tone creams, nothing is working. Anything you could suggest to help.","Doctor":"Hello. I am apprised of your concerns. I think that you are having a melanocytic nevus or mole under the eye. The redness that develops in the eye seems to be unrelated to the presence of mole. Moles can have varying depths which may involve only upper layers of skin or both the upper and lower layers of the skin. That is why, all of them do not respond to treatments that are meant only for skin lesions invading only the upper layers of the skin. The upper layers are called epidermis and the lower one is known as dermis. The best way out for such a condition in which dermis too is involved is to go for treatments that have the capability to go up to the dermis. For most of my patients, especially females and having facial lesions, I advise laser removal as lasers for this condition leaves negligible spot, are inexpensive as compared to other treatments, and have the capability to remove the whole lesion and heal fast too.Till that time that you decide to have it removed, you might like to use a concealer to mask the lesions. Certain other treatments like surgery end up with scarring. That is why, I am not in favor of that. I am sure, aided by this advice, now you are better educated about the options available and will get rid of the lesion soon."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I was seen over the weekend at the ER. They did a CT scan and saw an ovarian cyst that they believed wrapped around the ovary and ruptured. They also saw liquid in the uterus. I have only one ovary as this has happened before years ago.

I called the next day to try to visit a gynecologist for this as I am in all sorts of pain. Since I am not an established patient, they are waiting for a cancellation to get me in, as they are currently booked till two more months. UntiI this I cannot wait.

The fact that there is a large ovarian cyst which has invariably made the ovary bulky and the presence of acute onset of pain in the lower abdomen which if waxing and waning type may indicate a possible torsion of the ovary which is common in the presence of large cysts and is definitely an emergency. It would be better to rule it out with a doppler study first in which tortious blood flow may be evident. It is always better to consider ovarian torsion and deal with it first as the rest of the concerns can be managed symptomatically but not torsion which can cause acute loss of blood supply to the only ovary now and can cause damage and gangrene later. So it would be best if you would report to the ER asap. Torsion ovary, acute PID (pelvic inflammatory disease), acute cyst rupture. Doppler USG (ultrasound) urgent or laparoscopy.

She was diagnosed with a leak in valve when she was admitted a month ago with severe chest pains. One doctor suggests EECP treatment for her. I would like a second opinion, as some doctors also said that cannot work for her.","Doctor":"Hello. I want to assure you that do not worry as everything is going to be fine soon. Thanks for uploading the detailed case history (attachment removed to protect patient identity). I have thoroughly gone through your case and can well understand your genuine concerns. EECP is advised for patients who have chronic stable angina (long lasting chest pain) and is on the medications for the same for long time. When medications (like calcium channel blockers, diuretics, beta-blockers) does not work longer, we consider EECP for such patients of coronary artery blockage.   EECP causes counter-pressure in the coronary vessels and there is formation and opening of new and smaller blood vessels in the heart muscles to supply the areas of the heart whose original vessels are blocked due to disease. These collateral-vessels work as a natural bypass for the heart.   I do not think she will be a good candidate for the EECP as she has a different problems related to the heart. She has dilated chambers of the heart on the left side i.e. left atrium and left ventricle which is causing minor problems with the valves too on the left side but valves in large are working fine.  It should be first managed with medications and follow up. I preferably suggest going for a repeat angiography to see if that previous chest pain was due to the blocked heart vessels. Cardiac angiography, comprehensive metabolic panel. Can be decided on angiography report and may need only medical treatment first. Sometimes in future she may need angioplasty. Follow up is a must in her case."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I have my tubes tied. but in the last two months, I have been having all the symptoms of pregnancy but have spotted too.

If your concern is pregnancy here, and you feel that tubal ligation may have failed then the best way to put your doubts to rest would be to undertake a serum beta hCG (human chorionic gonadotrophin) test now which is negative shall confirm that you are surely not pregnant.  Though tubal ligation is a permanent sterilization procedure and failure rates are 1-3% but seen only in the next three months if at all. This has been three years now and you have been safe so rest assure that tubes are tied. The symptoms that you are experiencing corroborate more with premenstrual syndrome which indicates that your menses are due in the next few days. They include mood swings, sore breasts, nausea, headache, dizzy spells, distaste, increased frequency of urine and fatigue, all form PMS. So just wait for a few days and allow your menses to resume and once they resume they indirectly indicate that there is no pregnancy. PMS (premenstrual syndrome). None. PMS. PMS.

After a while, the bottom of my feet would burn. I think something is wrong with my brain because I have got my vitals checked and everything seems to be fine. I get hot really fast, regardless if I am outside in the sun, or in a hot room. The sun does cause rashes and itching if I am in it too long (not sure if that is relevant). Once I feel hot, I start to sweat a lot, I feel dizzy, and then nauseous with a headache. Every time I feel hot, I feel sick with terrible headaches. Even if it is cool through the house and everything is fine with me, say I will get up to clean and after five minutes of cleaning I feel hot, just from moving around. Also, I have excruciating pain in my neck, back, and shoulders all the time, a lot of time it accompanies a headache. I do have dry sinuses, bronchitis, and costochondritis and I used to drink plenty of water.","Doctor":"Hello. I understand your symptoms. There are two possible conditions which can present this way. One is fibromyalgia, where there is a pain at multiple sites in the body, some other vague symptoms and when investigated, almost all the tests are fine. Second, a less likely possibility is autonomic nervous system dysfunction, some of your symptoms like inability to adapt to heat, drinking a lot of water, anxiety, episodes of migraine may be related to that. The highest control of the autonomic system is from the hypothalamus in the brain, any lesion in that area can produce a set of symptoms like discussed above. You can take Dulane (Duloxetine) 20 mg at bedtime (if you are not known allergic to this one) this would help to some extent for pain relief. You can get an MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) brain done just to rule out any other cause of the headache and autonomic imbalance."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am suffering from genital herpes. My HSV IgG range was 1.74. I am having burning and itching in my inner walls of the vagina for about a week. Please help.","Doctor":"Hello. Let me explain everything. First I will explain about HSV (herpes simplex virus), signs and symptoms. And do you really have HSV or not. First of all HSV IgG (glycoprotein G specific antibody) is not a diagnostic test. IgG shows immunity in the body, not the disease. HSV IgM is the real indicator of acute infection. If it is high it means you have herpes infection. If IgG is high it means you have good immunity against herpes. So there is a basic difference in both. Burning sensation and ulcer are the main sign of herpes but itching never come in herpes. So I am really not sure whether you have herpes or some other infection like fungal. In herpes partner also has herpes problem. Partner also can complain of ulcer, pain, redness, and irritation of penis or area around the penis. Just review your sexual history, which means did you have unprotected sex? How recently you had and did this problem started after sex only? Here I am mentioning the treatment of herpes but I am not sure that you have herpes or not. I suggest taking Acyclovir 800 mg thrice in a day. Apply Acyclovir cream on the vaginal wall and on the ulcer. Both the partners should follow this treatment strictly for 10 days and have protected intercourse mean while. Now let me you how to be sure whether you have herpes or not. Get this test done if this value is high, then you have herpes if not then you do not have. 1. HSV-1 IgM. 2. HSV-2 IgM. These tests are the real indicators of acute herpes infection if one of them or both comes positive then you have herpes and you and your partner should get the above-mentioned treatment."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am experiencing stress at the work place which causes me to have multiple panic attacks.

I finished remodeling a manufactured home and college working full time. Every night starting around 9 pm I start to get stiff and then it slowly worsens by 11 pm. I can barely lift an arm or stand up without pain. Opening a bottle and buttoning pants during this time is a lot of effort too. This stiffness and inflammation also happens in the morning, while getting out of my bed and washing my hair is a real job for me to get done. The key points being by elbows, hands, and knees. Another problem I had that happened as soon as I moved out into my manufactured home is these scratches that do not heal, they look as if they are scars but then there are some that develop that are not from scratches. But it is more like a rash that itch (manageably) and they started on my underarms and the back of my hands, where now they continue to reside there. Now it spread to my legs, stomach and armpits. I have a sore throat now but I do not know if it associated with these problems. Please see the attached photos for the rash I am dealing with. I come from a polish background and my grandmother had RA, but not until her 60s and my parents never have had problems like what I am experiencing now. I am currently on birth control and Zoloft 50 mg daily. i did a thyroid test at the age of 17 and it was negative.","Doctor":"Hello. I have gone through your pictures. (attachment removed to protect patient identity).  The rashes do look like urticarial. It may be induced by environmental changes or it may be due to some other problem coming up. But, they do happen due to some form of inflammation going on. The pattern of your pain is a bit unusual as it happens in the night only. It may be due to your muscles getting fatigued over the long day of work. But, early morning stiffness, does point out towards another inflammatory disease. I am going to advise you on a few tests which you should carry out and meanwhile start on anti-allergics for these rashes. Do update me.

We have a daughter through cesarian and now she is 3 years old. We are using a condom as a safety measure to avoid pregnancy. She uses to have periods more or less normal lasting for five days. This time it came after 40 days with a spot of bleeding and no bleeding for three days after which normal bleeding has lasted for around eight days making it a total eleven days. This has never happened before and is worrying. Should we take this as some of the instance and continue monitoring or should we do some doctor followup? She had a uterus scan some five months back which was normal and a cervical smear test to evaluate cancer risk which was normal as well.","Doctor":"Hello. This episode of delayed and heavy bleeding might have been due to one of the two reasons. Delayed or absent ovulation. It is normal to have occasional cycle anovulatory and in such a case period will be delayed and heavy. If this is the case, there should be no need to worry as such an episode will not recur frequently. She might have been pregnant and it was early abortion and so heavy bleeding. Condom, used for contraception has a high failure rate and it is better to use some better contraception like oral pills or CuT (copper T). If bleeding has stopped completely, again, there should be no reason to worry. You can confirm whether she was pregnant by doing a simple urine pregnancy test. If it comes positive, you need to consult a gynecologist once for further management. Repeat the ultrasound if such episodes recur."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I have rheumatoid arthritis. There is a long waiting list to see a rheumatologist in my place. I am thinking of seeing a private doctor but I have limited funds. How often would I need to see a rheumatologist? I cannot afford it every week or maybe every few months. How often do you think I need a doctor visit? I am hoping to be prescribed a DMARD like Methotrexate. Then when my slot comes up with the NHS I will go there. I take Naproxen which is not enough and I had a cortisone injection in my knee a couple of months ago. The swelling did not go down completely but I walked better. It has worn off now, and I have pain in more joints and a feeling of lumps under my feet. I am on a special diet and my CRP, ESR and high rheumatoid factor have gone down by half. But lately, I feel unwell. I would like to know the frequency of visits needed.","Doctor":"Hello. I have gone through your history. The only part I did not get was, that how come there have been no DMARDs (disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs) for 10 years. It is a bit unusual. If you could throw some light on the history of arthritis, it would be helpful. If it was an intermittent one initially, or now it has become persistent? Well, as per the treatment, if it is confirmed rheumatoid arthritis, they will start you on Methotrexate straight away. The follow-up visits are usually within four to six weeks for the first time, and then after three months. But a lot depends on your treating rheumatologist. Most of them advise liver function tests after two weeks to see if the dose is not giving you side effects. But that can usually be followed up with rheumatology nurse. So once you are through with first visit and improvement comes, then a three months visit suffices. But if the disease keeps bouncing back, then a bit more frequent visits are needed. But hardly before six weeks as that much time, it takes for any new DMARD to act. So it is a bit tough to predict, but do not worry. No rheumatologist will call you back in a week or two. I hope this helps."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor,I am just wondering what is abutting and abutment of the nerve root means in a back issue. Please explain.

About seven months ago, he had an episode of foreign body pain in the eye which the contact lens could not control. His optometrist changed the type of lens after remarking that the lens appeared tight. Although the painful sensations have decreased, they are still present with more of a sore feeling now. His ophthalmologist suggested that he discontinue the Azopt drops he had been using in case the preservative was causing some corneal toxicity. His eye pressure without the drops has read at 18 and 20 on separate occasions, but he does have corneal edema which may affect the measurement. He has had high pressure in that eye previously, but it was mostly lowered by Cyclodiode treatment some eight years ago. The consultant said he had left him on the Azopt drops just as a precaution. My query is that if the bandage lens has worked so well for pain management for 10 years is it possible that it can continue to work? And if the Azopt drops and their preservative had caused some toxic reaction seven months ago, could that still be causing him to feel the discomfort? His consultant suggested out that he could have the eye removed to control the pain, but as he has what he feels is some slight, useful vision in that eye, he does not want to take such a drastic and life-changing step. In fact, he wants to pursue the least invasive course of action to relieve the pain he is getting. I would appreciate any advice you could give as he is in quite a bit of pain.","Doctor":"Hello. I reviewed your history. Bandage contact lenses are a proven and effective treatment option for pain relief in case of aphakic bullous keratopathy. Hence he can continue the same and I do not think these are responsible for the sore feeling of the eyes. For symptomatic relief, he can use artificial tears eye drops like Refresh tears eye drops. The removal of the eye ball called enucleation is the last step required in case of a painful eye and I do not think your husband needs this one at this moment.

I had a pregnancy scare a month ago but started my period finally. The day after my period stopped is when intercourse happened. Two days after that I woke up and I had a little bit of blood in my discharge my cramps were scattered through out the day I thought I was fine though. The next morning I woke up with bad cramps. I felt a trickle down my leg so I rushed to the bathroom and I was bleeding. The bleeding has slowed down since morning and my cramps went from morning to evening in pain. On my mother's side, we have miscarriages, ectopic pregnancies, tubal pregnancies, but no one on my father's side has had any problems with getting pregnant. Also, the nexplanon increases your chance of having an ectopic pregnancy. So I was wondering what this seemed? Should I worry? or is it just me getting my period again? What should I do about it? Please suggest.","Doctor":"Hello,  Welcome to icliniq.com. Considering the fact that you are using nexplanon, it is unlikely that the bleed would be probably due to pregnancy or even ectopic simply because nexplanon is a progesterone implant which prevents ovulation, make the endometrial lining unsuitable for the implant and increases tubal motility with thickening of cervical mucous making it difficult for sperms to penetrate through. Hence pregnancy seems unlikely.  Postcoital bleeding as noticed in your case could possibly be due to cervical erosions or ectopy, which can be possibly caused by an HPV (human papilloma virus) infection or after a rough sexual episode as well. But in either case, a per speculum exam is required along with a pap smear test and an ultrasound pelvis as well to rule out any organic cause. It is not your menses for sure. So advise would be to visit your physician for a local exam first."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I am a 26-year-old male. I weighs about 48 kg. I am writing this because I could not find proper diagnosis and guidance. This year I was diagnosed with bilateral mild hydronephrosis with 4 mm stone in both kidneys and also 4 mm cystitis. For one month I took ayurvedic syrup Calcurosin five to six bottles with Calcurosin capsules along with three kinds of antibiotics. After one month stones were passed and for hydronephrosis I took four doses of Gentamicin injections for two days. During these injections I suffered with severe head ache, vomit sensation, shortness of breath and urine cut for one day. I took this all treatment under a doctor of pharmacy graduate. So after getting all these symptoms I got afraid and immediately consulted a urologist. The doctor advised to have a CT scan kub plain, the report found to be normal. And serum creatinine is 0.7 mg. But even though CT scan found to be normal still I am suffering from pain radiating from back to the front. Abnormal urination like some times very frequent urination and sometimes very less urination. Serum creatinine before a month is found to be 0.8 mg, and last week it was 1.0 mg. At present my symptoms are: Pain radiating from back to front, numbness in hands and legs, leg cramps and leg pain above the ankle and thighs, lower back and hip bone pains, constipation, abnormal urine output, burning sensation and pain in penis, sometimes getting pain in the left side of the chest even during laughing and sometimes it is difficult to breathe in the morning. I am having recurring urine infection and bladder pain after masturbation. Doctor says no problem with masturbation and prescribed an antibiotic. But not addressing why it is happening? In six months I used eight to nine antibiotics. Urine report reads as specific gravity as 1.005. Earlier the urine ph was 5.5, I used Citralka syrup. It came to 7.1 but now it is 6.0. Ten days back I done a ultrasound scan test and found normal. Urine osmolarity shows 85. Why I am experiencing all these symptoms? Why getting abnormal urination some times more and some times less? Why creatinine is increasing (0.7 mg to 1.0mg)? Why specific gravity is low (1.005) which indicates any problem, earlier even during mild hydronephrosis it was 1.022? Why leg cramps, ankle pain? When there is no kidney problem why I am suffering from these symptoms? Is there any hidden problem? Once again shall I go for CT scan abdomen contrast. Will this scan cause any problem as I have already done it six months back but it is only plain. Kindly suggest what is my problem? I am facing all these symptoms only few days after taking Gentamicin injection. Do this injection caused any problem? I read in the internet that Gentamicin can cause Bartter syndrome, renal tubular necrosis. Is that true? I am attaching a photo of my left leg foot which shows some abnormality. Kindly suggest.","Doctor":"Hi. I have read through your query in detail. Please find my observations below. You are underweight and should start weight training exercises and increase appetite to 2200 kcal daily. Gentamicin occasionally causes adverse effects and probably you had some of it. However, since you stopped after taking four injections therefore not much damage was done. Since serum creatinine after Gentamycin was 0.7 therefore your kidney was not affected due to taking injection. If there is a side effect on a kidney after taking Gentamycin then the serum creatinine rises from 1 to 3.0 and this did not happen with you. Also, renal failure reverses to normal 14 days after stopping Gentamycin and you are unlikely to be having it. CT (computed tomography) scan was normal and it means that no stone was thereafter the treatment. In this case, the only reason for back pain might be a residual infection in the prostate. Also, you have taken antibiotics many times and felt better. There is a condition called nonspecific prostatitis and many people have the symptoms which you are having. This requires a long duration treatment. I suggest you get urine culture and sensitivity test done and if required then a cystoscopy to rule out any focus of infection as this might also cause pain and other associated symptoms. Please get your serum electrolytes tested to know if you are having any electrolyte imbalance which is responsible for pH changes and pain. Your symptoms might be due to more than one condition and it is requested that you please discuss in detail with the urologist and get required investigations to know the cause of your problem."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, My uncle has been diagnosed with cancer.

It is quite sad that your uncle has advanced stage of cancer. As you asked me how to differentiate between prostate and rectal cancer. There are three possible ways.  1. Serum PSA (noninvasive). 2. PSMA PET scan (noninvasive). 3. TRUS guided biopsy (invasive).  Doing a PCN (percutaneous nephrostomy) is a very good option as a tumor of such kind usually obstructs the ureter. And depending upon whether it is a prostate or rectal primary. Palliative radiotherapy along with metronomic chemotherapy is a good choice at this stage. But this will improve his condition on a temporary basis only. And if it is a prostate cancer then he can be started on hormonal therapy.

Two-year post-RNY (gastric bypass surgery) I have had two Petersen hernia repairs since the surgery. The gallbladder was removed years ago. Yet since this surgery I get these horrible gut-wrenching pains from sternum to abdomen. It seems like the bowels are twisting for hours, that takes my breath away, then I go to the washroom maybe ten times within four to six hours. I can lose three to four pounds in a day. I do not seem to be constipated as I go every day or other day but perhaps I am. The surgeon does not think it is another Petersen hernia since I had two surgeries to repair them. I have had a gastro endoscope mouth to stomach (shows no ulcers and colonoscopy diagnosed with diverticulitis), a CT scan and an x-ray. I do not take medicines except for 100 mcg Eltroxin. Due to surgery, I am on a lifetime of multivitamins, B12 1000 mcg every second day and Proferrin (iron supplement). I have no allergies to foods. I never had this before when I was obese. The pain is so bad I wish for death at times and it is unpredictable. Would you have any idea what this could be? I appreciate any help you can provide.","Doctor":"Hello. I have gone through your history. The symptoms correspond to cramping pain followed by the passage of stools ten times within four to six hours suggestive of intestinal colic, involving your large intestine. Even your colonoscopy revealed diverticulitis which is the cause of your symptoms. You have to be treated with antibiotics to resolve your diverticulitis which is active and with antispasmodics to relieve pain. Get a stool analysis, leucocytes, Gm stain, occult blood, and protein C and S tests done.

My first appointment with the new dentist, they took x-rays, and the dental hygienist started to clean my teeth. She noticed an excess cement that was from my crown procedure a couple of years ago and stated that it had to be removed because it is irritating the gum in between my crown and my other tooth. By the way, when I was young, they could not save the tooth, so when they extracted it, the tooth or molar next to it started shifting in an angle creating a hole in between the two teeth. Food gets stuck in there, but when my dentist replaced the crown two years ago, I started getting relief. Until now when I went to the new dentist and her dental hygienist told me that she would remove the excess cement. That is where it started going bad and annoying. Food was getting stuck in between the teeth again. My question is, do you think my previous dentist did the crown like that in purpose (putting excess cement to somewhat cover the hole ), or is the dental hygienist right about her findings or diagnosis? Mind you, I did not get examined by the new dentist until after the hygienist cleaned and removed the excess cement. It took her awhile to remove it and my gum was terribly bleeding. I was not hurting, but it was definitely unpleasant. Please advise.","Doctor":"Hello. I understand your concern. I saw the attachment you provided for example and got your point. (attachment provided to protect patient identity).  Removing excess cement stuck in between the crown and natural tooth is a correct procedure. This excess cement flow happens during crown fixing. This should be removed during the crown fixing appointment or the review appointment. But sometimes, this cement flows, very deep into the gums which cannot be seen clinically and easy to miss during crown fixing appointment. It can only be seen in the x-ray. This excess cement irritate the gums constantly and pushes the gums still further down thereby increasing the space between the two teeth. Your gums should be inflamed in that region due to constant irritation. That is why you had gum bleeding in that area when the cement is removed. Please have your next appointment with the dentist. A clinical photo or your x-ray is required to determine the next procedure to stop your food lodgement. Depending on the amount of space present, gum height in that region, your dentist may recommend you to use a periodontal proxy brush (if the space is more and cannot be closed) or close the space by a filling to the nearby tooth, or advise a new crown to compensate the space created by the previous cement flow. And please do note that advice has been given with the details provided and present clinical photo. The x-ray of the current clinical scenario is ideally required for a correct diagnosis and treatment planning. I hope this helps."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am 21 years old. I have too much sweat in hand and legs. I tried medicine but there is no effect. Please tell me how to get rid of it?","Doctor":"Hello. With the information you have given me, I understand that you are 21-year-old male suffering from a condition called palmo-plantar-hyperhidrosis. Here I suggest some methods by which you can get rid of the problem. Please keep in mind that these are just suggestions and one can prescribe a decisive treatment only on the basis of complete examination which includes relevant investigations and a thorough history. However, here are the suggestions: Topical agents: These can be applied and left overnight and washed off in the morning. Have to be done frequently for many days to correct the problem. Some of the agents are Drysol, Glutaraldehyde, Boric acid, Aluminium chloride gel, and Resorcinol. Many more chemicals have been put forward for the treatment of palmo-plantar-hyperkidrosis. Iontophoresis: It involves the passing of electric current through the skin. Two varieties in vogue are tap water iontophoresis and anticholinergic iontophoresis. Botox injections: Intradermal injections of Botulinum toxin A help in reducing sweating due to their anticholinergic action at the neuromuscular junction. Surgical methods include radiofrequency ablation, open and endoscopic surgical thoracic sympathectomy, subcutaneous liposuction.

In the fourth and fifth weeks, I had a fourth-generation antibody-antigen test performed and it came back negative. Should I be retested again?","Doctor":"Hello,  Welcome to icliniq.com. It is a good idea to get repeat testing, here is why. The antibody testing at the fourth and fifth weeks can give you some idea of the HIV (human immuno deficiency virus) status, but the one at 12 weeks after the exposure will confirm the negative status completely. The reason being the window period. The window period is a duration where a person can have HIV but still test HIV negative. The fourth generation is antigen-antibody based testing and the best we have so far for screening. When suspected acute HIV infection or high risk exposure, PCR (polymerase chain reaction) is the best in the fourth and fifth weeks post-exposure. Of note, the window period for a fourth-generation antigen-antibody test is short as compared to other HIV tests available (about four weeks). Usually by this time, 95% of infection will be detected in the blood. In general, there is a three month window period for HIV after a given exposure, and therefore for the fouth generation testing to confirm that a person is more than 99.9% infectious. Hence the 12 weeks retesting is recommended. I hope this helps."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, Eight years ago, my family and I went on a vacation. When my mother got out of one of the outdoor pools, she started feeling a sting on her arms and all of her legs below the knees. She has been to the doctor for this condition and she has gotten numerous ointments. The only ointment that does help the uncontrollable itching and stinging has been Zyrtec. But, she still continues to have itchy and stinging skin. She cannot take any exposure to the sunlight, which is why she wears long sleeves and pants during summer days, along with an umbrella. I recently looked online and I found some symptoms of solar urticaria. When I read them to my mother, she confirmed to have all the symptoms. She does not have any noticeable rashes, but she does say that her skin is extremely stingy and itchy which really impacts her days and some of the sleepless nights that come with this itching. Would it be possible that she has solar urticaria? Would you recommend her to take a photo test to see if it is solar urticaria?","Doctor":"Hello. As you explained that your mother has developed solar urticaria. Here I explain a few other importance of solar urticaria. Intense itching, swelling and rashes develop in sunlight. You can correlate it. Whenever she goes in the sun, she gets these things. If you are able notice this then undoubtedly it is something related to the sun. Many times only itching is the main symptom which your mother has. Now, once it has started, avoiding the cause is the best way to treat. Once you are sure that it is happening due to sun just avoid going out in the sun. Photo test is not a treatment. It is a test to know that your mother has a sunlight allergy or not and it can get noticed by symptoms. So, no need to get tested if you already sure about the cause. Regarding treatment, sunscreen is must. Use sunscreen without fail. It does not matter whether you are going in sunlight or not. You have to use it. It should be thrice in a day. It could be like 9 AM, 12 PM and 3 PM. Anti-allergic tablets like Levocetirizine, Avil (Pheniramine maleate), Teczine, etc. Continue it for three to five months. These have totally no side effect and subside the allergy and itching. Consult a specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and take the medicine with consent. Continue using your ointment with a good moisturizer too. Avoid sweats. Sometimes, sweating itself increase allergy.

There was always +/- in the morning and then I ate breakfast. I had an appointment this week and doctor told me it should be no ketones. What is the risk for my baby? I am very worried now. Is it harmful for my baby and what is the risk? Can my child be retarded because of this or has some cognitive dysfunction? Or neurological or any other problems? Please answer in details.","Doctor":"Hi. Let me start by assuring you that your baby is absolutely fine and will not have any problems in future life. Let me tell you how. Usually, mother always has a poor appetite and poor food intake during the first half of pregnancy. This is due to the hormones of pregnancy. Your weight may even decrease during this period. But God has bestowed baby with the quality that it will absorb all the required nutrients from the mother's body. So mother loses all the nutrients, if she takes food during this time, then she will feel better, baby is always fine. During the second half of pregnancy, especially after 28 weeks baby starts growing very fast and needs lots of nutrition. Your weight should have started during this time. To give you a rough idea- baby weight near 32 weeks is around 1.75 kg and in just next 8 weeks, that is at 40 weeks it will weigh more than 3.25 or 3.5 kgs. So you are very well within the normal range.  Ketone bodies are usually negative and indicates your hydration. If you do not take enough amount of water, this will increase. To affect baby brain, the level should be very very high and stay so for many days. When you say that your weight has increased, then there is nothing to worry. To allay your concerns- just have a scan. Take 2 scans at 4 weeks interval. If they show adequate sequential growth, it means baby has got adequate blood supply, nutrients and you have nothing to worry. I would like you to concentrate what you have in hand. You have 8 weeks to go. Just keep eating whatever you like, lots of sweets (if diabetes in pregnancy has been ruled out), high protein diet, plenty of fluids. This will keep you hydrated and also supply sufficient nutrients to baby. Rest assured baby will be fine and with normal brain growth. All you need to further think of is to have nutritious food now on."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I have some skin problem above my right ear. It is the place where a put my spectacles.

Left atrial enlargement. 500 RSR pattern in V1/V2. What is my status?","Doctor":"Hello. The limited details provided in the query suggest that your heart is racing at the normal rhythm that is known medically as sinus rhythm. There is enlargement of the left-sided upper chamber of the heart named atrium that receives blood from the lungs after the lungs have mixed all the oxygen in that blood. Probable causes may be stenosed mitral valve of heart or some abnormality with the musculature of the heart chambers.  The rSr pattern on an EKG (electrocardiogram) V1 and V2 can be due to benign non-pathologic variant of the rSr pattern (may be seen in an asymptomatic and healthy person). Sometimes this is normal variant of the rSr pattern on EKG leads. But if the patient gets a heart attack, syncope or cardiac arrest meanwhile, this rSr pattern is misleading then and is taken as a pathological one. In severe heart diseases that may be even life-threatening such as Brugada syndrome and arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia.  There is a negative P wave in lead V1 and may be normal physiologic variant as seen in less than 10% of individuals (notching of the P wave on EKG). Sometimes this negative P wave is due to real abnormality in case of a left atrial enlargement or right atrial disease. Final suggestion: It is always difficult to explain EKG without actually seeing it, along with all the case scenarios in front of you and also needs a physical examination of the heart with a stethoscope. So, please consult a cardiologist for an in-office complete evaluation of the heart along with signs, symptoms, diagnostic tests and all case history."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I am a 19-year-old female.

But the second one on the bottom which is much smaller still has completely white color and around the vagina blades, I have a little while dots. Also, there are very tiny warts line along the blades. So, when I went to see the GP near my house he had a look and said that there is nothing to worry it is still small. But in my opinion, I think it is quite big. So the doctor gave me a prescription for Condyline paint which he told me to use for three days only per week and I have to keep using it for three weeks and if it does not get better he told me to see him again. Now I have a few questions. Is this mean I have an HPV virus inside my body? How can I make the virus go away permanently? Will Gardasil injection make it go away? If it does not go away permanently, how can I make sure that I have no HPV viruses and so these warts will not come back again? Is this mean that I have this HPV from my boyfriend? How to use Condyline paint correctly? I wash my vagina blades and use the cotton pads to dry it, then I use start to use the Condyline paint. I only dip the swab once into the reagent and then I open my vagina blades so that I am able to paint the two warts inside my vagina as much as I can. Then I paint it all over the very tiny warts in the vagina blades area. Am I doing it correctly? Now I have been using the Condyline for two days, but the very tiny warts that are around the vagina blades started to grow more. Is this mean anything? Can condoms prevent these HPV viruses? If I break up with my boyfriend, will this help my symptoms and health to become better? I am very scared of whether this can leads to cancer? I do not want this to ever happen to me again, how can I prevent this to happen again? If my warts are gone can I have sex with my boyfriend? Will these symptoms comeback again? If I decided to buy the Gardasil injection and injected it now, then the next after two months, then next after six months, but during this time can I have sex with my boy friend? Will the vaccine still work?","Doctor":"Hello. I have gone through your history and pictures provided. (attachment removed to protect patient identity).  I appreciate that you have consulted the doctor and begun the treatment. As rightly prescribed, Condyline (Podophyllotoxin) paint is very effective in genital warts. The right way of application is by using a cotton swab or brush applicator on the clean and dry visible warts. Wait till the paint dries before putting on garments. Avoid application to surrounding normal skin. Repeat application two to three times a week until there is a substantial shrink in size or disappearance of warts. Genital warts that you have acquired are because of humanpapilloma virus (HPV) infection which you might have got through sexual route. Most of the times even if one has an HPV infection, it will be subclinical. The infected person not necessarily will have warts but may still continue to shed infective virus in secretions. Once infected with HPV, its elimination is not completely possible nor its elimination is measurable. However, you can prevent symptoms of HPV infection by boosting immunity against it. Gardasil is one of the vaccines against HPV types. This is most effective in preventing cervical cancer when taken before the start of sexual activity and before 26 years of age. However, you can still take the vaccine as the strains that cause warts and that may cause cancer are not the same. Thus Gardasil can still provide immunity to a certain extent against cancer causing HPV. The best way to monitor cervical cancer is to get regular cervical smears. HPV can be present in normal looking skin too. So, the disappearance of warts does not mean free from infection. It is important to use barrier methods like condoms during intercourse to prevent re-infection and further spread. Since the warts are intravaginal, some lesions may not be visible to you. It is better you take doctor's help to apply on all visible warts. If your partner also has HPV infection, the chances that warts will reoccur or spread are more. I recommend a dermatological examination for your partner also. And it is advisable to maintain abstinence during the treatment and vaccine period to help achieve good immunity. After the successful treatment of genital warts and vaccination, sexual activity can be resumed. However, the use of barrier methods during intercourse is advantageous in preventing re-infection. Having one sexually transmitted infection predisposes one to acquire another. UTI (urinary tract infection) could be one of the symptoms. I recommend both partners to have a thorough check with the STD (sexually transmitted disease) expert for early intervention if required."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I had my two back molars on the top left side of my mouth filled about three weeks ago and after a few days, everything was fine. No pain, nothing. But a few days ago, I realized that every time I drink hot, cold, and sometimes even room temperature liquids there is a sharp almost piercing pain that lasts for a few seconds. (More so with the cold drink than hot or room temperature drink). It does not hurt to bite down but it does hurt to actually chew something on that side. Even when I take a deep breath through my mouth, the cold air hurts the tooth. The pain feels like the liquid or the air is literally going inside my tooth and releasing that sharp pain. I made an appointment to see my dentist and he said the nerve might be exposed. What does that mean? What kind of procedure needs to be done? Or what do you think is wrong?","Doctor":"Hello. First, get a radiograph done for those two teeth, it will tell the status of your teeth. Sometimes, if the filling is high, you experience pain. The filling might be fractured. The nerve exposure means caries has reached till the pulpal horn. Parts of teeth: Enamel: a hard mineralized structure that forms the crown part of the tooth. Dentin: calcified tissue. It is covered by enamel on the crown, cementum on the root part of the tooth and surrounds the entire pulp. Cementum: specialized calcified substance covering the outer surface of the root of the tooth. Pulp: consists of nerves. If caries are present in enamel or dentin filling is done. If caries reaches the pulp, root canal treatment has to be done. The dentist is talking about root canal treatment, in that treatment infected or dead pulp is removed and medicine is filled. Radiograph of those two teeth. Get a radiograph done and plan further. Meanwhile, do lukewarm saline mouth rinse three to four times daily. Use desensitizing toothpaste. Avoid too hot or cold food and beverages."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I need the treatment for the pain in the last disc of back bone. Please suggest.","Doctor":"Hello. The commonest cause of back pain is mechanical, i.e. because of odd posture while sitting, sleeping and also because of lifting heavy weights. I am not very clear about what you have asked in the question that you need treatment for the last disc. Is that a prolapsed disc or disc bulge? Here are a few suggestions to reduce your low back pain. 1. Maintain a proper posture while sitting, make sure that your back and head and aligned in a straight line while you sit down and also while riding any vehicle. 2. Sleeping supine, i.e. with your lying down with your back parallel to the floor and you facing upwards on a firm mattress is known to reduce the pain. 3. Avoid lifting heavy weights until the pain subsides. 4. Stretching exercises of the back and legs are known to help in the reduction of back pain. 5. Warm compresses, i.e. using a cloth that is dipped in warm water or a water bag (pain relief bag) will give some relief. 6. Tablet Paracetamol 500 mg three times a day with eight hours gap for five days may be tried. 7. Diclofenac gel can be applied two times a day over the site of pain. 8. If the pain is very severe or if it is increasing in severity in spite of the above measures, it may be a good idea to visit an orthopedic doctor for a complete evaluation. I hope this helps."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I have a problem with dry eyes, mouth, and vagina. I cannot cry because there is no tear production. I also have episcleritis in my right eye. Now I am afraid that I have sjogren's syndrome. The other thing that is even worse is I cannot tolerate any antibiotics. I discovered that when I had to take antibiotics for UTI, Macrobid, Primatene, and Amoxiclav. They switched so many antibiotics because of such severe reactions, memory problems, not able to concentrate, to think, to remember, then like burning from inside, no salvia, fatigue, etc. I have even done EEG at that time, and it was abnormal. Doctor said that something is slowing your brain. I felt like a toxic reaction, the symptoms lasted for four months. I get the same reaction even from one eye drop named Tobrex. Now I a have few questions. Could this be an autoimmune reaction on antibiotics? I do not have the diagnosis yet, still waiting for results. If that is true how you manage dose reactions on antibiotics? I am afraid of any kind of antibiotics. Is there any treatment that can make me tolerate antibiotics? Or are there some safer antibiotics safer for sjogren's? During childhood days I did not have any reactions to antibiotics. Will they have a major effect on CNS, body, muscles, and nerves? Please help.","Doctor":"Hello. Please do not panic. Yes, this can be an autoimmune disease. In fact as there are dry mouth and dry eyes, clinical diagnosis is Sjogren's disease as you mentioned which is an autoimmune disease. Sjogren's disease is basically of two types, primary where there is no cause for Sjogren's disease and secondary Sjogren's disease where there is some associated autoimmune disease. I would not say that it is due to the autoimmune response to antibiotics. Toxic reaction to an antibiotic can cause Stevens-Johnson syndrome, but that is a severe disease with the different clinical picture. So to summarize this, in my opinion, it is not due to an autoimmune response to antibiotics. There is no relation between antibiotics and Sjogren's syndrome. It seems you are either multidrug-resistant or there is some underlying autoimmune disease causing all these symptoms. The investigation will help in diagnosis and treatment will depend on the investigation reports. In case a patient is not comfortable with any antibiotics, or if some antibiotics cause unwanted response then we can just stop that antibiotic and treat those unwanted symptoms. Nothing more can be done. If all antibiotics were safe in your childhood then these must be safe now, and so, in my opinion, these symptoms are not caused by antibiotics. I hope this helps."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor,  I was using a plug-in mosquito repellants for my baby for long, and she often gets cough and cold. Is it because of that? What shall I do?","Doctor":"Hello. Mosquito repellent liquids can cause allergic cold, and cough in some kids. I cannot say definitely if that is the cause of cold and cough in your kid. But in this season, many kids are suffering from viral respiratory tract infections. So the cause may be a viral infection or allergic cold due to other reasons like cold weather, dust, rain, etc. If you have been using the repellent for a long time and she has not suffered from frequent cold, cough then that may not be the cause.

This abnormal hemoglobin results from point mutation at the stop codon of the α2-globin gene (TAA > CAA) which leads to the addition of 31 amino acids to a normal α-globin sequence. The heterozygous of Hb CS (hemoglobin constant spring) is clinically and hematologically normal with mild anemia in some cases as it appears to be in this case. Heterozygous cases have a good prognosis and a fairly normal life expectancy. The genetic abnormality can only be confirmed by genetic testing."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, My son is 6 years old. He got lung allergy so the doctor gave Levolin 100 and Budecort inhalers and some syrup like Montair LC kid. So my son is getting free from the fever, coughs, and cold by using these medicines. After completion of these medicines course, he is repeating with the same cough, cold and fever. Where as he will not eat any foods like chocolates and other flavored items, but he eats very rarely. On using these medicines is there any side effect in his growing future? I want to know is there any permanent solution for him without using these medicines and being healthy? And he is getting this problem when there are changes in weather and if he eats any chocolate and other foods. My son gets a fever with a high temperature of 101 and goes to 103 degree celcius. Sometimes we used to give him Meftal 8 ml and P-250 or Calpol for every four hours when the temperature was 100. After giving these medicines he was being sweated a lot specially on his head.

After the course of calcium and vitamin D3 sweating problem will also reduce. About the food discuss with your pediatrician as it depends on the individual child. Dry fruits can be given but few children mat have a nut allergy."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, My nose is blocked partly, one side is opened and the other side is blocked. It has been a long time like more than 10 years. When I consulted a doctor before they concluded that it is allergic rhinitis. I sneeze multiple times in one shot, like three to four times. When I consulted another doctor, they asked to get an x-ray of my nose and concluded that bones of the nose are not straight, so it needs an operation. Some doctors said it is polyp that needs to be removed. I did not do any operation, because I heard that it is better to treat without any operation. Now it is still blocked with itching and I sneeze several times. What is your advise? What I should do?","Doctor":"Hello. Let us look at your problems in a systematic way. Nose block on and off and on different sides each time sounds more like a rhinitis problem. If it were deviated nasal septum then the block will be predominantly on one side. Such a block will not be that easily relieved. Deviated nasal septum if diagnosed and causes a severe block, snoring, mouth breathing and difficulties can be surgically corrected and placed in the center. Allergic rhinitis can cause multiple sneezing, itching of nose and eyes, watering of eyes and nose block. The rhinitis can cause itching in the back of the throat and palate also. Allergic rhinitis is a genetic condition that does not have a complete cure. We advise allergen avoidance, taking antihistaminics and steroid nasal sprays. Last, nasal polyposis can be associated with allergy and sinusitis. They cause constant nose block and nasal discharge. They cause post nasal drip. Occasional or frequent headaches, especially in the facial region or brow region, are associated with polyps. Polyps if found to be of higher grades require surgical correction. Coming to the diagnosis of each problem, we need to do the following on you. 1. A thorough clinical examination with anterior rhinoscopy. 2. Nasal endoscopy in OPD (out patient department), which will clearly show deviation or polyposis. Nasal endoscopy is done after adequate local anesthesia and decongestion. It typically is painless most of the time. 3. Non-contrast CT (computed tomography) scan of para nasal sinuses (coronal, axial and sagittal views). The CT is a superior investigation to x-rays and clearly shows the involvement of sinuses, the existence of polyps or sinonasal pathology, deviation of the nasal septum, condition of the lateral wall of the nose, mass in the nasopharynx, etc. 4. Serum IgE (immunoglobulin E), elevated levels signify atopy or allergy. 5. Complete blood count inclusive of but not restricted to absolute eosinophil count. I trust you understand that there are clear treatment protocols for various conditions. Not all conditions can be cured by medicines alone and not all can be done by surgeries alone. Some nasal pathologies will require medical and surgical methods for adequate relief. If there are any reports from previous ENT doctor visits please attach those in the next query. This will help us unnecessarily repeat investigations and help us diagnose faster. Do attach the x-ray film as well as report in the next query. We do obtain some relevant information from x-rays which we can use here. Until we come out with a clear diagnosis and treatment plan, I would suggest you start on Mometasone spray two puff twice daily and tablet Allegra M once daily. If I were to get a patient in my OPD with these complaints I would give these medicines that I mentioned above. Do revert back so that we can help you."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am a 15-year-old cheerleader who experiences bad back pain. I was diagnosed with scoliosis at the age of 10, but everyone that I have met with scoliosis did not have pain like me. I have tightness and pain in my elbows, shoulders, ankles, knees, and hips but the back pain is excruciating. I wake up at least two times every night in pain, sometimes in tears. I cannot take this pain anymore. I have been experiencing it for as long as I can remember. I used to be insanely flexible but now I cannot arch my back without getting lightheaded. Last year, I consulted a doctor to find out what was wrong with me and the doctor did not believe my pain. Please tell me whats wrong with me.","Doctor":"Hello doctor, Sorry to hear that you have pain for such a long time. I am sure you understand that I cannot fully answer your queries without seeing you and examining you. But it sounds as though you have joint hypermobility with scoliosis. This can cause severe pain because your muscles have to work much harder than people without hypermobility to keep your joints in the correct position. So your muscles become tired much more quickly than other people. You have probably already researched hypermobility but a good source of information is the Arthritis Research UK website. The good news is that the condition is benign and does not lead to arthritis in later life. It sounds as though you need a comprehensive physiotherapy program with someone who understands hypermobility and scoliosis. You may also need an MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) scan of your back to ensure there are no nerves being pressed on the back, and finally, perhaps you need to take some painkillers such as anti-inflammatories, Paracetamol or a neuromodulator such as Amitriptyline. You will always need to pace your activities more than other people to prevent excess muscle fatigue.

Doctor told it is a sentinel and no treatment is required. Now two years back I had an anal fissure. It got healed but reappear after every two or three months. I also follow my diet regime and water intake but still, it reappears mildly with mild pain. Will it ever be treated by medicines or I need surgery? Currently, I am not taking any medicines. Please suggest.","Doctor":"Hi. The sentinel pile mass you have is due to an underlying chronic fissure. The issues with fissure are usually aggravated by constipation. The main factor to avoid fissure is to avoid constipation or hard stools or even straining at stools. When you have a chronic fissure you have to follow these measures. 1. Dietary precautions, avoid constipating foods. 2. Good hydration, drink two to three liters of water. 3. Use laxatives like lactulose syrup as and when needed to avoid constipation. These can be used at night so as to have a good bowel movement in the morning. 4. Anal creams containing Lignocaine (Smuth, Anovate, etc) or Diltiazem (Diltigesic) when you have pain. Surgery is done only when you have acute fissure with severe intolerable pain. Not preferred in chronic fissure as is your condition. Pain occurs due to spasm of the sphincter muscle and surgery aims at its division partly. It will be effective only when it is acute. You can now continue your dietary measures, laxatives, and anal cream as and when needed. I hope this helps."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, Can you please explain to me the results of pediatric MRI. Patchy regions of increased T2 signal intensity within the periatrial deep white matter are primarily with the terminal zones. The hippocampi are both relatively small and with mildly prominent flair signal.","Doctor":"Hello. The hippocampus is a structure deep-seated at the level of the temple (at the sides of the forehead). It is significantly small in a condition called medial temporal sclerosis, which can give rise to epilepsy. That is why they have mentioned that the hippocampus is relatively small but, there is no atrophy as such, so the changes in the hippocampus are not contributing much to epilepsy. How to find out whether it is contributing to epilepsy? Your doctor would correlate the MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) findings with EEG (electroencephalogram) pattern and find out. Regarding T2 hyperintensities in the deep parietal region, it is just suggestive of increase water or myelin content in the deep area of the brain behind the ears but in front of occiput. This is not producing any signal changes in other sequences than T2, so this may not be significant at all. I hope you understand this. MRI findings are too technical to convert them in simple terms. I have tried my best to make it simple."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, My husband has a problem with pinhead sperms. Is there any treatment in Ayurveda? Please suggest.","Doctor":"Hello. The pinhead is due to the absence of the DNA material within the spermatozoa (sperm). Thus, a higher number of pinhead sperm are not favorable for conception. Only one healthy sperm is going to reach the ovum, to get a baby. So, even with less healthy sperm, conception is possible. Both husband and wife should be equally healthy enough to get conception. For your husband, traditionally, we give gold, Ashwagandha, and zinc-based polyherbal drugs. At the same time, you also can consume aloe vera based drugs. So, I advise the following for your husband. 1) Capsule Rathina purush one in the morning and one in the evening. Continue till pregnancy get success.  2) In diet, he can take pure cow milk, cashew nuts, sprouted green gram, groundnut, other edible seeds, and drumstick as a vegetable.  3) He should avoid tea, coffee, smoking, chicken, alcohol, and packed foods, fruit juices and soft drinks strictly. All these damages the sperm.  4) Should not wear tight jeans pants. Should not get exposed to continuous heat and radiation sources, these things will reduce sperm quality.  5) Weekly once apply sesame oil to the whole body and head. Wait for one hour and then take a bath in warm water.  6) Daily before bed, take normal water (not cool or not hot, it should be in medium level) or mild-warm water in a tub. Sit in this water by dipping buttocks and genitals within this water. Sit for half an hour. Then come out. My advice to you: Tablet aloes compound two tablets in the morning and two in evening after food. Continue this tablet until you get pregnant, stop in between during menstrual days. Note: a) I hope you had done all the tests for infertility to you and your husband. If any varicocele in testis or hydrocele, that is to be corrected.  b) For you, the ovulation, endometrial thickness are important.  c) There are a lot of healthy couples with normal lab report, without a successful pregnancy. So, I would say that the baby is nature's gift and that you get when the couples have positive thinkings (positiveness in life and mind). So, please keep your mind positive with hope."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am having blood pressure and diabetes.

Tinnitus is often described as a ringing in the ears like roaring, clicking, hissing, or buzzing which cannot be attributed to an external source. Post-traumatic tinnitus usually follows head and neck injuries. Do you have tinnitus in both the ears or in one ear? Any history of hearing loss? Any triggers like exposure to loud noise? Does loud noise or loud music hurt you? Well, for treating your tinnitus other causes for tinnitus need to be ruled out. Compacted ear wax. Drug-induced as if you are on high doses of Aspirin for any other reason. Management involves a multidisciplinary approach. Good to know your CT (computed tomography) and MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) being absolutely normal. I would suggest you go to an ENT specialist for audiometry to see for any hearing loss. Ear wax removal if any. Drugs cannot cure tinnitus, though may help to reduce the severity of symptoms. Take Tryptomer (Amitriptyline) 10 mg half an hour before you sleep, tablet Alprax (Alprazolam) an anti-anxiety drug 0.5 mg at bed time should help you to get some sleep. Avoid tea, coffee, and alcohol. Masking devices: Ear devices similar to hearing aids that produce a continuous low-level white noise that suppresses tinnitus. Tinnitus retraining device, also a wearable device that delivers a mask to the specific frequencies of the tinnitus you experience. Over time, it will accustom you to the tinnitus. Cognitive behavioral therapy and counseling also help a lot.

Our family friend suggested me to consume Kalarchikai medicine, powdered mixed with pepper and honey to have it for one mandalam (48 days). I have completed nearly 44 days by consuming one small ball of the mixture every morning and before two weeks I got my periods. Then I had checked whether the cysts were dissolved by having an abdomen scan. But still, small multiple follicules have been seen in it with both ovaries enlarged. Kindly suggest me what I can do further. I got married before one and a half years and I am much worried about my pregnancy. I have gallstones as well.","Doctor":"Hello. I just read your query. See Kalarachi Kai choornam is helpful in amenorrhea. As far as small cysts are concerned they are unmatured eggs which failed to induce menstrual cycle previously, as a result, they got collected in the ovary and they will remain in the ovary. Now, you have got your periods you can start trying for conception. But I advise you to do it under the supervision of a nearby gynecologist because egg size is important while conception and that you can know by ovulation study. Ovulation study is performed under the supervision of a gynecologist. For gall stones, surgical intervention is required generally. Medicine is not of much help."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, During masturbation I just rub the tip of the penis and not the entire penis. Is it a wrong way of doing?

I suffer from premature ejaculation and low libido. I am not currently on medication. I am non-diabetic and no other medication. Please prescribe Ayurvedic remedies.","Doctor":"Hello. It is more important for you to find the cause of this. High blood sugar levels, lack of essential nutrients in the body, lack of sleep, stress and a bad lifestyle are some of the common causes. My suggestions are:  1. Get a blood test done to rule of high blood sugar and deficiency.  2. Bring about changes in your lifestyle. Have food at the right time daily, exercise for 30 minutes every day. Include plenty of fresh fruits, vegetables and healthy natural supplements like almonds, dates, and walnuts in your daily diet. 3. Aswagandha lehyam, an excellent ayurveda medicine to treat the above symptoms. This is available in all leading ayurveda stores and also in online portals. Take one teaspoon of this medicine twice daily before food. Take it for two months and then follow up with me.  4. Almond oil, is a traditional time tested remedy to treat low libido and premature ejaculation. Take eight drops of almond oil mixed with a cup of unsweetened milk every day in an empty stomach first thing in the morning. Above all, stop worrying and stay calm. Worry will only aggravate the problem."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, Usually, I let my cats go out and play in the backyard. They frequently bring in fleas and bugs in the house. So I get flea and bug bites. I usually get red bumps on the areas of my legs and lower legs. But recently I notice that there is a confined area that looks like a scab. This is how it happened? The area was really itchy so I started scratching it a lot. After this I noticed a fluid or watery stuff coming out of it. After this, I noticed a scab formed in that area. It is dark red and looked strange.  So I took a picture of it and asked a doctor online. He said it was an early form of cellulitis, and suggested some antibiotics for it. I did another consultation with a doctor online, and he said it is a minor allergy like dermatitis from the flea bites and suggested some cream and antibiotics. I am confused. So, I went to my doctor today and she told me she does not think it is cellulitis. However, she can prescribe me antibiotics in case it is cellulitis. I heard most of the time if someone has cellulitis but there being treated with antibiotics the prognosis is very good and the infection leaves in about seven to ten days. If you do not take antibiotics it can be life-threatening. Is it true? The antibiotic I was prescribed was Cephalexin 500 mg one capsule four times a day for 10 days. Is taking four times a day means like in the morning, afternoon, evening, and night? I thought of takiing it twice a day. I am confused. I am going to take a picture of that area. Please let me know if it is cellulitis? It looks like a scab though. Can cellulitis or even minor cellulitis look like a scab? In your opinion should I take the antibiotics? Does it look like cellulitis to you, or just a flee allergy reaction that got itchy? I have attached a picture.","Doctor":"Hi. I have reviewed the attached photograph and can appreciate the scabbed area. (attachment removed to protect patient identity).  It is not cellulitis at all. It is because of the intense itching the area has excoriated and then turned into a scab. No need to take oral antibiotics. You can simply apply topical antibiotics like Neosporin ointment on the affected areas twice daily for seven to ten days. This will resolve the scab. Do not scratch it and let it fall off on its own."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, My menstrual date was on the 4th of the previous month, and I got married in the same month. This my pregnancy test becomes positive and during my abdominal scan doctor said that my baby's NT rate is 3.17 and the nasal bone is short. Five days later again I have done a scan in that my NT rate came as 2.1 mm and nasal bone is ossified, the result was satisfactory. But mistakenly the ultrasound technician put my LMP date 10 days after my actual date. Without noticing it, we have done a double screening and the result came as low risk. Today I went to the hospital to give a blood sample for triple screening, then only we noticed the mistake on the LMP date of ultrasound. Will it affect my triple screening result? Does it mean my double screening test was wrong?","Doctor":"Hello. I have seen your reports. (attachment removed to protect patient identity).  During the first scan, your baby was 11 weeks and the NT (nuchal translucency) was 3.17. That was a high value but it has been seen in nine out of ten babies with thickness 2.5-3.5 mm at 11 weeks will be normal. The next scan shows your NT was 2.1 mm and your period of gestation 12 weeks. As per your truly calculated fetal age, this was low risk. At 12-13 weeks, the normal value is 7mm (50th percentile thickness), 2.8mm (95th percentile thickness). So considering these two values only, you are not at high risk. But I must tell you that the measurement of nuchal translucency alone is less effective for first trimester screening than the combined test (nuchal translucency measurement and biochemical markers). But definitely for this, there is a need to mention the true LMP (last menstrual period). Otherwise, there will be again a mistake and just like the previous one you have to recalculate the whole."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I have neck, shoulder, and arm pain. It swells in my triceps and my biceps hurts like it is torned. I can make simple moves. x-ray confirmed cervical lordosis. Please help.","Doctor":"Hello. I have gone through your complaints and understand your concern. I generally see many cases like this at my clinic. I give them rest, analgesics, anti-inflammatory tablets, and ice packs till the symptoms reduce to some extent. Then I get an x-ray and if necessary an MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) done to find out the exact reason. In your case, there are three possibilities: 1. Soft tissue inflammation, there may be no bony involvement only the soft tissues around the region might be inflamed that may be causing the pain. 2. Neuropathy, there may be a partial or complete inflammation of the nerves in that region that may be the root cause of such kind of pain. 3. Disc prolapse, there may be a compressed nerve in the spine somewhere that might be causing radiating pain in those regions. The possibility of a disc prolapse should be kept in mind. I suggest you get an x-ray as well as an MRI done to find out the exact cause. Physiotherapy, analgesics, anti-inflammatory drugs should help until then. Do get back to me after your reports are ready. But I assure one thing, even if it is either of the above three possibilities, all have a good prognosis and you should eventually get back to normal in a few days.Nothing to worry about.  I hope this helps."},{"Patient":"Hi, This is regarding my husband who is 35 years of age. Four years back, after a nasal septoplasty surgery, the doctors realized that his blood pressure was very high. After doing all the tests he was diagnosed with moderate concentric LVH. My husband who is 5 feet and 6 inches was 98 kgs then. He was put on hypertension medicines and was on diet and exercise and he visits his cardiologist every 3 months. He has now reduced his weight to 79 kgs. In the ECG report taken last year, the diagnosis is Sinus Arrhythmia, Prolonged P-wave and complete Right Bundle Branch Block. The Echo report at the same time says concentric LVH, No RWM. Normal Valves, Normal LV systolic function (62%). Doctor had advised him to continue with his medicines, diet and exercise. What do you make of the ECG and Echo test? Is it fine to continue with the hypertension medicines, diet and exercise. His blood pressure is under control now. Could the LVH be reversed?","Doctor":"Hello, I have gone through his reports. So he has hypertension and he needs to be on medication for long term. However in future with weight loss and healthy lifestyle like avoiding fatty oily and high calorie food, plenty of green vegetables and fruits etc. his requirement for antihypertensive may go down. So his future BP readings would guide regarding that, but as of now he should be on regular BP medications with regular BP monitoring. Best BP readings would be 110 to 130 systolic and less than 90 diastolic. Now regarding Ecg and echo, firstly they are all hypertensive changes and not worrisome. Concentric LVH would be there even if BP is under control and it's not going to cause any problems. ECG doesn't show complete RBBB, however there are early RBBB changes which are again likely related to hypertension and not worrisome. Sinus arrhythmia is normal finding and nothing to worry to about prolonged P wave. So there are changes which are not very significant and alarming. So in a nutshell, he should focus on BP control, healthy lifestyle, get his lipid profile tested and he should be subjected to treadmill test after age of 40 years.

If you miss a dose of Diane 35 and are more than 12 hours late in taking a tablet, follow these guidelines to help you decide what to do. Week 1: Take the last tablet as soon as you remember and take the next one at your normal time, which may mean taking two tablets in one day. Contraceptive protection may be reduced and you are at risk of becoming pregnant unless you take other contraceptive precautions for the next seven days. Week 2: Take the last tablet as soon as you remember and take the next one at your normal time, which may mean taking two tablets in one day. You are not at risk of becoming pregnant and do not need to take extra contraceptive precautions. Week 3: Take the last tablet as soon as you remember and take the next one at your normal time, which may mean taking two tablets in one day.

But I have a problem with my bowel and sometimes I need to wear gloves and use oil with my finger to take the stool out. But a couple of times when I had my periods some of the blood stuck to my finger as I was trying to get the stool out so it entered my rectum. I was just wondering if it is possible to get bowel endometriosis that way?","Doctor":"Hello. I understand your concern about the problems in bowel movements. I think there is some endometriosis island or adhesions or deep endometriosis in the pouch of Douglas, the lowest end in the pelvis, lying just in front of rectum, anus and behind the cervix. The kinking has altered the rhythmic flow of the bowel contents. You can have injection Leuprolide 3.75 mg monthly once, intramuscularly three to six doses. This will temporarily clear any endometriosis and deep endometriosis. Following this period either have medications to stop the period if you are not planning for pregnancy. If pregnancy is in plan, get pregnant as soon as possible. So periods will stop for 10 months.

I had these thoughts for around 2 to 3 years and sometimes I do compulsions especially digital compulsions. My work is mainly on the computer, so even deleting or renaming files create some thoughts in my head. I hear about exposure prevention therapy and I was reading that we can record the thoughts and listen to them till they reduce the anxiety, but I cannot in record the thoughts which are blasphemous. What do you think is the best therapy in my case? As I already have anxiety issues which led me to go to the emergency room (because of panic attacks, probably because of my past addiction post acute withdrawal symptoms), do you think those thoughts would go away along with the anxiety itself?

As you had OCD in childhood and anxiety disorder and taking St John's wort, Omega 3 , Magnesium and Vitamins (attachment removed to protect patient identity). You need to start SSRI group of drug (Fluvoxamine or Fluoxetine or Escitalpram or Sertraline) as St John's wort is not sufficient to manage your all the symptoms.

You need to visit your therapist to do these therapy as you alone might not be able to do these. You need not to take different drug for OCD, anxiety, panic attacks. Only SSRI group of drug will help you for these.

What happened is that day I felt the urge to masturbate but what happened on that day is that I felt ashamed because I felt that I really dirtied the place (because of masturbation) and that the apartment was not mine for me to use it that way. That made me feel shame and telling someone did not solve it. I feel this deep shame whenever I meet anyone because I feel like nobody has ever done this in such a way in such a sequence by sort of taking advantage of the place you were given just because you did not have water which makes what I did bad and I felt if someone knew about it then they would laugh at how I took advantage of this apartment situation, etc. I felt that if I stayed there then maybe it would be something common and no shame would be present. I still have the feeling that because it is scarce that I did something bad and that I am hiding that whenever I speak to any person and that they do not know I did that because it is a taboo. P.S: I do not have problem with that act, I just feel ashamed from the situation of which it happened that is uncommon and cannot shake off remembering what happened and feeling ashamed as a person in my all to day life. Since I started discovering these sexual traits as a child, I always regarded semen as an unclean thing and tend to overwash after masturbation and regard masturbation as something that everyone hides, therefore, it is bad.

I am taking medicines for the past seven days, but no results. And with the same, I am having piles problem as well. I have done my urine test. Please help.","Doctor":"Hello. I just read your query. You did not mention your urine report here. It will help me in prescribing accurate treatment and you did not mention your medicines that you are taking for your infection. Anyways first of all itching can be due to some sort of infection or might be due to negligence of hygiene. First of all, whenever you go to pass urine, wash your vagina with fresh water and clean it with a soft towel. Always keep your vaginal area clean and dry. Change your undergarments daily. Next thing drink eight to ten glasses of water every day. It will help you in excreting waste from your body and it is also beneficial for your piles problem too as it will help to prevent constipation. Take Renalka syrup two teaspoons three times a day with half glass of water for two to four weeks. Take syrup Neeri (AIMIL) two teaspoons three times a day with water for two to four weeks. You can take these medicines with your antibiotics too if you are taking any. Apply V-gel two times a day locally on your vagina. If you have any sexual relationship then take precautions because in infection if you do intercourse it will exaggerate your problem. So do it safely. For your piles you did not mention from how long do you have this problem and does these are bleeding piles or not and some other information that I needed to prescribe you the exact medicine. All I can say that constipation increases the problem of piles so try to avoid the problem of constipation. Take a fibrous diet. Eat salads, fruits and drink plenty of water. Avoid spicy, deep-fried food. You can have Triphala churan two teaspoons at bedtime with lukewarm water to avoid constipation. For detailed treatment about piles you have to send me the details about your problem. I hope this helps. Fungal infection or lack of proper hygiene and constipation. Urine examination and urine culture.

I understand your concern for your son, I hope he is fine. Since then, if he has no further bleeding and no seizure episodes, and is fine with no complaints he can attend the school and participate in sports and other activities.

Even rugby would be risky, so try to postpone rugby training for at least four weeks to prevent any further head injury which would complicate the previous injury.

I have spoken with a urologist and a neurologist elsewhere but they said it should go away on its own and that masturbation should not cause such a thing, but this answer does not satisfy me as it has yet to cease and has been tormenting me non-stop. I do believe vigorous masturbation to be the culprit hence I try to cut back but with the sensation still continuing. The feeling gets really bad especially when I sit down on a seat or lay on my side in bed. And car rides are the worst. I have studies that I attend to, I stay in those to help get my mind off of the tickling but with no success as the tickling bothers me that much. I have difficulty doing anything, and I am afraid to get a job having this feeling all the time. Exercise and drinking lots of water do not help at all. I tried Azos with no relief so I moved on from that. I had a random urine sample taken at the doctors office and it came out fine but I am not sure what they looked for when they tested it. I had my privates visibly examined and the doctor said everything was fine. Also, I had my hormone, testosterone levels checked and the doctor said they were fine as well. I have not taken any medicines or prescriptions for this condition, and currently I am not taking anything. I am so very tired of this feeling as it has been interfering with the things I love the most. Worst part of all this is that since I feel ticklish down there my mind gets filled with all kinds of sexual thoughts stimulating me to masturbate even more making the feeling even worse and more intense than before, there are times I cannot even sleep at night because the tickling or aroused feeling is so bad.

However, there is a huge ideological difference between my mother and me. Our religious views are poles apart and I feel someone is smothering me with those ideologies because I tend to take full control of situations under me. (eg: vegetarian vs non-vegetarian, etc).I cannot seem to express myself clearly. I feel like I should be leaving home and live my life the way I want to. But I always end at the same level and I tend to forget. I feel this has been an ongoing issue in my life. I am going through a divorce and I started having trust issues with people. Please help me and guide me.","Doctor":"Hello. Your dilemma is quite common. It is perfectly normal to have ideological differences with family members, but we can continue to be close to our family. You made a very important comment that \\"I cannot seem to express myself clearly.\\" It is important to sit down with your mother and have an open talk about these issues which is grinding you down. Sometimes parents do not always realize their children are grown up adults and have a mind on their own. Being clear and explicit with your mother about topics to avoid will help to ease your tension. Is your mother trying to be supportive in her way? Going through a divorce can be a stressful experience for anyone. It can have an overall exhausting effect on your life but will gradually get better with time. I can understand your predicament. I think sometimes we have to accept that you cannot change an adult's personality but work around minimizing conflict. In this situation, it will help to just accept your mother as she is and learn to tolerate some amount of disagreement. Gradually develop better-coping strategies. Yoga and meditation can help. Look after yourself during this period. Eat healthily, sleep well, exercise regularly, talk to trusted family members and friends. Do not isolate yourself as it can worsen the situation. If you find it difficult to cope, you can consider professional counseling."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, My son is 14 months old. He had a bad cold and congestion for the past seven days. We consulted our local pediatrician, who suggested a 5 ml of Nuhist twice a day. This medication makes him sleep quite a bit and when I tried reading up about it, there was not much except that some of the components in the medicine are things that should be taken in consultation with a doctor. I just want to confirm, is this dosage right? Should we continue the medicine and in what dosage? Should we be taking care of something in particular?","Doctor":"Hello. The medication your kid is getting is one of the medications for cold. It has the side effect of causing some drowsiness like any other cold medication. The side effect is something that occurs with the normal medication dose. We usually prescribe medications based on weight. I presume your child would be around 12-14 kg. If he is drowsy with that dose, you can give him half the dose, which is 2.5 ml two to three times a day and three days of medication would be sufficient if he is relieved of the symptoms. The main side effect is drowsiness and decreased alertness. If it is not affecting his day to day activities, and his congestion is getting better with medication, you need not worry. Only ensure that he is not left to himself when he is under the medication effect. There are some less sedating medications that can be used, but we use less frequently in kids below 2 years."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, For about three weeks now my right ear is not hearing properly, feels blocked some times and pains some times. My hearing has come down probably to only 30% that I can understand only when some one speaks on this ear. My other ear is fine. I consulted a GP who could not locate any infection and said this is because of the eustachian tube is blocked. He had given me hay fever tablet and Beclomethasone nose spray. I am seeing no difference after two weeks also. Doctor says it might take six weeks some time. I cannot consult an ENT specialist now and I am little worried. Does it really take so long? What can I do to expedite? How do I be sure that it is not any other complication?","Doctor":"Hello,  Welcome to icliniq.com. According to the symptoms you have mentioned the condition in your right ear is called SOM (serous otitis media). It is a collection of sterile glue like fluid behind the ear drum. Nothing to worry about, and yes it takes at least four weeks to resolve but is a treatable condition. Treatment of underlying cause i.e. cough, cold if you have one is necessary. Start on antihistaminics Levocetirizine 5 mg or Fexofenadine twice daily. Instead of spray, it is better to use decongestant nasal drops Oxymetazoline two drops in both nostrils three times a day. Take steam inhalation once in the morning and once in the evening. Perform Valsalva maneuver at least thrice daily for three minutes. Blow air in the cheeks, then close your mouth and pinch your nose and try to expel the air through ears. This maneuver is very helpful but has to be performed under the proper guidance of an ENT specialist or you can log in to youtube and look for videos. Do not apply too much pressure on eardrums while performing. I hope this helps."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, My mother has been diagnosed with probability of lower GI bleed in proximal jejunal small bowel loops through nuclear scan.

But, this time, she is getting blood loss on more frequent duration and thus doctors asked to do nuclear scan to check for any GI bleeding.

I only saw a bump, but I felt the opening so I put it in between my cheek and teeth and there it was an opening and some white yellow stuff.

The bumps were not itchy and were just on her stomach, back and limbs. We initially thought it was eczema, as we already know she suffers from this or measles, but she is up to date with her vaccinations. We took her to the doctor and they said it was a viral exanthem and it should clear up. Not but a few days later, she spent the day with the babysitter and they said they were out and forgot a diaper so it is possible that her urine was on her longer than normal. Later that night, she started saying her butt was sore and come to find out, she had a cluster of bumps in between her butt cheeks and a little on her labia, which her buttocks were the only part that was sore due to the acidity from her urine. Bumps also appeared on her face, most exclusively around her mouth (not on lips and not inside the mouth). But later on, she developed bumps on her nose and along her jaw up to her temple and some on her ears. We took her to the ER because it was clear that whatever she had, had progressed for the worst. She saw the doctor and as we were in the hospital room, she started saying she was itchy. She had never been itchy before, but now she was itchy all over and more and more bumps started to appear. Now on the tops and palms of her hands, tops, and soles of her feet and a lot more on her limbs. The only place that does not have bumps as of right now is her neck. We were confused because these bumps were never itchy before, but now she complained about how much it itched. It seemed to itch the most on her feet. The doctor diagnosed her with impetigo and prescribed us Mupirocin ointment and Amoxicillin and Clavulanic acid (Augmentin) to take orally. We were also told to give her Benadryl in conjunction with it. It is been a few days and it does not look like there is any progression in ridding her of this infection. Now she has some bumps that are inflamed and look white which kind of resembles a mosquito bite or something. Other bumps have a tiny black center to them. She ended up scratching her leg and within hours, it became inflamed in white and had tiny black dots in the center (not sure if dried blood or what it is). Then the surrounding area broke out even worse into tiny bumps like an actual rash. So much so, that her whole leg looks just red. Her other limbs started looking this way as well. It definitely looks worse than it ever did before and we are afraid that it is something more serious and the doctors we have been taking her to, keep misdiagnosing her. Please help.","Doctor":"Hello. Your description gives me two possibilities, one is skin infection which we term as pyoderma, which has a severity range of being mild to very severe. An antibiotic like Augmentin (Amoxycillin and Clavulanic acid), Mupirocin would definitely help. She also has an itching for which Benadryl is given. Did she have fever anytime? Second is an allergic rash for which might have gotten infected is another possibility. If there are no pus formation or oozing bumps, we can apply mild steroid creams, which takes care of both itch and rash. And the antibiotic covers the infection. So you can Tryptophan the cream which you were using for eczema before if you have it. I do not know if you can get it over the counter. It needs slightly longer duration of treatment as it has been there for three weeks. Some tests like a swab of the wound can be sent if lesions are not responding to Augmentin. A picture would have been more helpful. Continue Augmentin, Mupirocin, and Benadryl. Flutivate (Fluticasone) cream for local application for five days, to be applied as a thin application, but not on the face (only If lesions are not oozing or not having pus)."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, My friend is 20 years old, female. Before some days ago she was sense less on a train and then this again happened with her. She consulted a doctor and he says that she is suffering from the first stage of conversion reaction disease. But the doctor could not suggest any medicines but he says that the last stage of this disease is paralysis. Doctor says to my friend that do not take any tension and to keep her mind free all the time. She was feeling weak what will she do?","Doctor":"Hello. I have read and completely understand that you feel quite concerned for your friend. As you have mentioned that she has been diagnosed by the doctor as having conversion disorder, it is quite probable that she may undergo these conversion attacks at any time. There are purely psychological reasons behind this disorder, no medical cause lead to this condition. Therefore, generally, no medical treatment could be found a cure for these attacks. If the doctor has suggested this diagnosis after complete assessment then there may be no further need for the tests. If complete testing has not been administered yet then you may go to a psychologist for confirming the diagnosis after keenly observing her medical test reports. Needs to be differentiated for the types of conversion disorder according to the DSM-5 (diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorder) criteria. Conversion disorder. Generally, no particular medication is prescribed for conversion disorder. However, some doctors may suggest medication after observing the patient's current condition (beware these medications would reduce anxiety or tension but would not cure the conversion disorder).  The effective treatment for conversion disorder is found to be psychotherapy. Consult any psychologist or psychiatrist specialized in conducting psychotherapy sessions. Or you can suggest some online consultation sessions.  Treatment mode can be cognitive behavioral therapy plus psycho-education. Must take expert guidance on how to deal with the patient behaviorally. Family members, closed ones of such patients also need guidance because their mishandling can increase the frequency of conversion attacks. Do take follow-up if you feel the need."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, My teeth are very small and my roots are too short and twist together, leaving my teeth loose and fragile. I cannot eat certain foods or bite into apples because I have to be cautious not to accidentally pull my front teeth out. I also have a large gap between my two front teeth. Multiple dentists have mentioned veneers before, but I was wondering if there is a better option? I read that putting veneers on fragile teeth is not a good idea, but I am not sure what else could help me besides dentures. All dentists are very hesitant as to what to do because I just turned 17 and doing anything drastic on someone so young is a lot to consider. I understand, though my dentist and oral surgeon both have said that eventually, I will need more work. What are all of my options to get a set of teeth that are not so fragile? I have been to several dentists in various different locations. Since I can remember going to the dentist, the focus was always on my gap and my lack of enamel due to acid reflux (GERD) since I was an infant. I had braces for two and a half years. The braces did not close the gap all the way, but it was significantly smaller until I lost my retainer. I am fine with having my gap. If my teeth were healthy, I would have no complaints. But my teeth seem to just be getting very gradually something to put higher up on the priority list. I also have ground my teeth since I was a child, and so they have damage from that as well. All of my teeth that are in front of the canines are very loose. I am currently taking Citalopram, Seroquel, and Lamotrigine.","Doctor":"Hello. I can understand your concern regarding dental health. Your small, loose and fragile teeth and short and twisted roots are because of GERD (gastroesophageal reflux disease) which is presence since infancy. In such case, physical examination and x-ray investigations are very necessary which you have already done. So, I will suggest you to follow the advice of your doctor because they have guided you according to your current oral condition. So, better to follow them for good results earlier. Talking about the gap between upper front teeth, it can be resolved by composite restoration. So, nothing to worry about it. Do not brush too forcefully and frequently. Do it in circular motion and slowly. Drink lots of water to avoid the dryness of mouth. Do not brush immediately after drinking tea or coffee. Avoid sweet diet. I hope this helps.

Eat green vegetables as these act as natural antioxidants. Chocolates and almonds are known to increase sexual desire. Do not smoke or drink alcohol. Do not wear tight underpants. Engage more in foreplay. Drugs like Dapoxetine will help to increase the time of ejaculation. Anyhow, I would suggest you to go for semen analysis. Also, go for penile doppler to know the status of blood flow to the penis. Urine infection does not cause sexual dysfunction.

One can go with full mouth case with dental implants when the underlying bone conditions are ideal, which means patient's boney ridge should have adequate height and width. As per the age, there should not be any bony resorption. Bone conditions are important for implant stability. Systemic conditions like blood pressure and blood sugar levels should be under normal levels. After going through your given reports, patient's blood sugar levels are not constantly under control. So, need to check HbA1C (glycated hemoglobin) and follow up with diabetologist for strict diabetes control.

Two years ago I fell on my thumb hyper-extending it and fracturing it in the process. Doctors that I have gone to said I have tendonitis in it now and that is why it hurts in the first place though no testing has been done to confirm it. It used to only hurt when I overused it in band and percussion and for some odd reason when it was about to storm. Lately though it has been hurt more and more frequently enough to have begun interrupting my everyday life. I take anti-inflammatories prescribed to me regularly and a brace when it acts up. The brace is slightly lower than my wrist and extends up into my thumb so it will support the areas that need supporting. Is it just progressing into a worse form of tendonitis? Am I making it worse by playing the instruments? What do you think?","Doctor":"Hi. It can very well be tendonitis or some kind of arthritis secondary to damage. I think you should undergo MRI of lower forearm and hand so that we will confirm the diagnosis of tendonitis and rule out other pathology. Regarding management you can better try topical antiinflammatory drugs like Diclofenac gel rather than oral drugs. You should avoid strenuous activity. Exercise program with gradual loading of the joint will be helpful. These exercises can be taught to orthopedician or physiotherapists."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I have been getting flashes on my right eye during the night. It is either a white or orange light. I am concerned.","Doctor":"Hi.  Flashes may be due to central cause like irritation in brain for example in migraine (half sided headache) people can see flashes of pattern of light. Do you have any headaches while observing these flashes? Or some local cause in eye can cause flashes. Sometimes jelly in the back of eye starts liquefying and detaches or pulls the retina that can cause flashes of light. This liquefacation of vitreous and its detachment is an aging process but it can occur in young people after some trauma, in high myopia (using minus glasses), or any surgery. This process is called posterior vitreous detachment (PVD). Sometimes (not always) PVD can be associated with a break in retina that can cause floaters or curtain in the vision. That is an emergency for eye examination. So you can visit your eye doctor for a complete eye examination. He or she will guide you accordingly."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, My penis is in erection stage 5 inches, so is it normal?

Size of 5 inch is absolutely normal and is in fact above the average penis size of most of the males. So no need to worry. Immediately after marriage due to lack of experience a lot of males suffer premature ejaculation and they ejaculate even on touching the vagina. This is normal, just do not lose confidence. Medicines like SSRIs like Dapoxetine can be used to delay the ejaculation time. You can talk with your doctor for prescription of this drug."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, This is my 34th week of pregnancy and I recently started having pain in numerous areas. For one when I sit down it is difficult to get back up due to sharp pain in my lower back. Then I have pain in my upper abdomen which seems to last 20 to 30 minutes. I do not want to go to the hospital for these pains and get sent home. So are they normal?","Doctor":"Hi.  I do not see any reason for you to worry. Let me explain.  Delivery is not a single day phenomenon on that end of 10 months. Your body is gradually relaxing, which includes all the muscles, ligaments, joints for that moment of relaxation and expulsion of the baby. Even a hormone called relaxin is released to do this job. So this will cause back ache. Also the baby head which becomes harder and heavier, the bones of skull being ossified, will compress on to the nerves and ligaments of the pelvis. This will create ache, sometimes very severe, but only the delivery of baby can relieve you of this pain.  To have relief from this pain have good posture while sitting, standing, do not lift weights in back bend position, avoid soft beds (use the firm coir mattresses which do not bend as per your back shape), try some back stretching exercise (hold the head end of cot and try to touch the foot end of cot with toes, or go further till you stretch your back), can have some local application of painkiller oinments). As the baby grows, the stomach and bowel are pushed up, so you will have gastritis and irritation in upper abdomen.  Now the only four reasons you will need to consult the doctor or hospital are (I hope you have no other medical or obstetric risk factors):  1. If you have severe lower abdomen pain- starts within 1-3 secs and gradually increases in frequency and severity, associated with it the uterus becomes hard or tense, you will not feel the body parts. Do not panic, even if it is the real pain, delivery will be 10 to12 hours later (if this is your first baby).  2. If you find the water just flowing down your leg, just as you are peeing on yourself, it will be a warm water. 3. If the baby movements are reduced- baby has to move at least 4 times after each meal- so 12 per day. 4. If you see any sort of bleeding."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor,I am just wondering what is abutting and abutment of the nerve root means in a back issue. Please explain.

Please upload the scan to see the disease, sphenoidal retention cyst may not always present with headaches and if it is fungal ball in sphenoid, it can definitively cause headaches and has to be approached immidiately. 3. How often do you have symptoms of allergy like sneezing, nasal discharge, watering of eyes? The above answers will help us to come to a conclusion and also will let me give you a permanent closure to the problem."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, On having sex I start to lose my erection, when I wear condoms also I do not feel anything after wearing condom. It was my first time and I did not feel any pleasure while entering a vagina. Is this a major issue? Should I get it checked?","Doctor":"Hi. First of all, you should understand erectile dysfunction. You are just 23. At your age ED will never come unless you are in some influence of liquor or drugs. Other than these two reasons, ED can also happen due to performance anxiety. Anyone can feel anxiety and apprehension when they go for first time sex. That is natural. Not knowing what to do and how to do, not having sexual experience, worry about getting pregnant, worry about failure, worry about satisfying that partner, worry about what will happen if others come to know, etc., there are so many stressful anxious questions inside your mind. All these combines to create performance anxiety and ED happens. So do not worry about that one incident. Regarding condom, while wearing condom, men naturally have lesser pleasure because of the sheet between penis wall and the vaginal hole. Do not worry too much about it because the more you worry, more the problem will trouble you. Take care."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am a 21-year-old female. I had unprotected intercourse with my partner the day after my periods end and consumed an i-pill on the same day. I had a blood discharge after 10 days and it was there for three days. I expected my period dates to be between 19th to 24th of this month but my periods were delayed. So I did a home pregnancy test and it is negative, and till now I have not got my periods, are they delayed? What may be the cause? When can I expect my periods? Are there chances of pregnancy?","Doctor":"Hello. Taking i-pill during the first half of the period cycle results in early periods. The three days of bloody discharge you had was actually a light period which came earlier due to the i-pill. So, now expect your next period around a month after that bleed. No need to worry it is very unlikely that you are pregnant."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I have been struggling a lot with my weight for the last two years. I consulted a dietician a few months ago, I have been on a balanced, calorie-controlled diet and I have also joined the gym. I am on a quest for a healthy balanced lifestyle. However, I am really struggling to get some weight off. My current weight is 90 kg, and I am 163 cm tall. I am very depressed and sad because of all the hard work I put in without results. This is really taking its toll on my personal life. My dietician suggested that I can consult a doctor to see if there is anything that could be prescribed to help me. I have used 20 mg Duromine before, when I was younger, for three months and I really had great results with it. I thought that maybe I should try it again to get the kick-start I need and to boost this new journey. I am currently taking Cyclidox. Please help.","Doctor":"Hello. I am sorry to hear that you have struggled so much with losing weight and have started to feel depressed from it. I must, however, commend you on the great work you have done so far, trying to take control of your health and owning a more balanced future. I have recalculated your BMI (body mass index), and it works out to 34 rounded up, with an estimated body fat of around 40%. I must stress that I am not a dietician or nutritionist and these are the people often best placed to help with weight control and living a healthier lifestyle. As a doctor, I would always advise having investigations done for conditions that may contribute to an inability to lose weight. These conditions are often endocrine in nature. An initial assessment can be done by a general practitioner, who will then refer you to an endocrinologist if necessary after some blood investigations have been done. Only once these have been excluded then we begin to suggest using medication such as Duromine (Garcinia Cambogia). Duromine is an appetite suppressant as you may already know, and the key to weight loss is not to starve your body but to give it the nutrients it needs and deserves while being aware of the macronutrients and calories you are absorbing. Doxycycline has a tendency to make one retain water when taking it for a long time (which in turn causes water weight), do you mind me asking what you are taking this for? You are quite young, and still have a lot of time to settle into your body. Weight loss takes time and effort that I understand you have already put in, but I can help by advising some investigations and only after then we will suggest medication that helps to reduce the amount of fat being absorbed after consumption (not Duromine). Caloric intake and burning mismatch. Some medications like antidepressants, hypoglycemics, corticosteroids. Endocrine conditions like hypothyroidism, Cushing's syndrome. If you are happy with the response, then please let me know so we might be able to order blood via a pathology lab and assess those. I can liaise with your dietician, make a solid plan and we will take it from there."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, 5 or 6 days ago, I slept all through the night wearing only a boxer. The next day, I noticed a slight itchy pain closely at the tip of head of my penis. The next day, I saw a dotted blister at same spot where I noticed the slight itchy pain. At first, I thought it was the work of an electric ant, because presently at the area where I live, there are electric ants. So, I decided to use antibiotics. But the blister is now spreading, getting to my penis mouth hole. After a week I went for a medical checkup and when the result came out, I was tested negative for some STDs. The doctor told me it is an infection from bad toilet and water. He prescribed Aciclovir tablet 400 mg, Aciclovir cream and Piriton tablets. Now I am almost done with the drugs, yet injuries have not healed. Two days ago from now another small red blister came out. I am scared and worried. What could this be? STD? If not, what could it be? No painful urination, no serious itching scratch, no serious pain. Age: 21, gender: male.","Doctor":"Hello. Looking at the images (attachment removed to protect patient identity). I am of the opinion that it is genital herpes. I suggest you to retest for herpes after four weeks as testing too early after infection may yield a false negative result. I can see multiple erosions on glans penis in these images. That is how genital herpes usually presents. There is some bacterial superinfection as well as the floor of erosions looks dirty, yellowish. I suggest you to take oral Valacyclovir 500 mg, twice daily for 5 days. In addition I suggest you to use a topical antibacterial like 2 % Mupirocin ointment, twice daily."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, Is it difficult for a dentist to remove the roots of the teeth that are broken off at the gum line? And will it be painful when they do it? I think the ones are teeth 12, 13, 16, 26, and 27. If there are any chances for the bones to get broken while they do it? How will they get them out? I am very scared, and how many injections will be given? I think they are breaking it into three appointments. what complications could occur as well?","Doctor":"Hello,  Welcome to icliniq.com. Do not be scared at all. This should be dentist's headache, not yours. All you need to know is that you should take a proper meal at least half an hour before you go for your appointment because after the extraction you will be on a soft diet for a day and should avoid eating till one and a half hour at least. Mild swelling or slight pain is expected post extraction of posteriors, otherwise, it will be a smooth recovery for the rest of broken roots. Take icecreams (if you are not diabetic) and soft diet for a day. After 24 hours of extraction start saline water mouth rinses (use lukewarm water) four times a day for a week compulsorily. It will help in quick healing of the sockets. Now, let me tell you about the procedure, it will not be complicated if the roots are not infected. Local anesthesia will be given then the whole procedure will be absolutely pain-free. You will not feel anything so be happy about it. Be relaxed, if you will be relaxed your dentist will enjoy doing work at ease and comfort level."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I did have one sore on my vagina, a blister appears from no were was sore, itchy and burning a bit and there are lots of white stuff around my vagina clit, it was fine then this appears from no where and I cannot pop or scrap it.

It is a dirty smell. Also, my lips get dry, my arms and legs get pricks, and my top lip tingles.","Doctor":"Hello. The lesion appears to be a follicular infection or folliculitis and unlike any STD (sexually transmitted disease) especially herpes which has a confluent multiple blister growth. The pain and inflammation seem classical to folliculitis and it is likely to be after you have shaved. I would suggest the application of ointment Soframycin (Framycetin) thrice a day over it for three days and can take antibiotics short course for three days with Amoxycillin. However, the foul smell per vaginum indicates an infection again and itching accompanied indicates a mixed vaginosis recurrence. So please get a high vaginal swab culture to establish the cause and then further treatment can be offered by your gynecologist."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I suffered from terrible anxiety and OCD that seems to come and go over time. My mother had exactly the same disorder like myself. She was diagnosed with an under active thyroid and autoimmune thyroid issue. On taking medication to sort her levels she has been free from the mental health problems. I recently started getting the issue again and took a thyroid function blood test. All levels were within range but my FT3 was slightly elevated at 8.97 pmol /L. I would love an expert opinion on if periodic FT3 level increases could be causing the anxiety, depression, and OCD issues. I am currently on Sertraline 150 mg. Coupled with my mother’s exact issue, and cure, I am not sure what these results could mean? What should my next step be and could this elevated FT3 cause my anxiety to start?","Doctor":"Hello. I just read your query and from what you have mentioned it appears that you have sub-clinical hyperthyroidism and the FT3 here does not seem to be high enough to be causing the symptoms that you have mentioned so rest assured on that front as of now. This condition does not need any treatment as of now. This condition just needs regular follow up thyroid function tests every six weeks to three months. You must consult your psychiatrist for your anxiety and OCD (obsessive compulsive disorder) issues. You can also benefit from avoiding caffeinated beverages and alcohol if at all. So as regards the thyroid function test just keep repeating it regularly. I hope this helps."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am 20 years old. At work, I had an episode of my heart started racing out of the blue. I could feel it pounding in my chest, and it made it feel like I was choking. I got very dizzy and thought I might faint, and started sweating. It only lasted about five minutes. I have issues with panic attacks, but this was an entirely new experience. Could it be another manifestation of panic, or might it be something more serious?","Doctor":"Hello. There are various reasons for having palpitations along with dizziness. The most important one is an abnormal heart rate or rhythm which starts suddenly and terminates abruptly. This could be detected by different monitors that you can carry with you, these devices can pick up the abnormal heart beats. Second of all is a thyroid disease, excessive thyroid hormones can cause stimulation of the sympathetic nervous system and you will feel hot, flushed with palpitations. Weight loss and diarrhea along with excessive appetite may also occur. Last but not least, is the most common type and is called vasovagal phenomena that happens when you suddenly change position from sitting to standing. Your body does not have enough time to compensate and you may feel having racing heart beats with dizziness. Panic attack is a diagnosis of exclusion and I would not jump to this conclusion as of now. I believe you experienced the last type I mentioned above (vasovagal), having said that if you have another episode, I would suggest seeing a cardiologist. Try cutting down on caffeine intake (including soda and other caffeinated beverages). Request your doctor to check your thyroid function test. I hope this helps."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I have been on birth control continuously for three years. About a month ago, I took a pill late instead of in the morning. My boyfriend has not ejaculated in me. But, I noticed that I have gained weight. What are the chances of me being pregnant after taking a pill late? I do not have periods since I take the pills continuously.","Doctor":"Hello. This is a common mistake that you have faced. However, a single late pill intake is in no way could turn you fertile as well as pregnant. Even if you miss a single pill, the chance of pregnancy is very remote. Now, continuous pill intake could be the reason for absence of cycle. We advice this sort of continuous pill intake only if you have endometriosis, a disease produces painful menses. However, you need to take pills with a gap of 7 days pill free period or have to be on inert pills for 7 days. Then only, you will have cycles.

I take two inhalers, Salbutamol and Fluticasone, regularly. Is this hypoxia caused by my asthma? Is my steroid inhaler not doing its job?","Doctor":"Hello. As you said you are asthmatic and taking two inhalers. But you suffer exertional dyspnea and fatigue also hypotension and all this is because of hypoxia. Your asthma is not under control. So you need to increase the dose of Fluticasone inhaler or take a combination inhaler of Fluticasone and Budesonide (Symbicort 320). Your doctor will help you to give you the proper inhaler with standard strength. Using Salbutamol frequently is not good as it worsens your asthma. The goal of asthma management is no day time symptoms, no night time symptoms and able to do daily activities without symptoms. So I advise you to see your physician at earliest to increase the dose of your inhaler. I hope this helps."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor,I am just wondering what is abutting and abutment of the nerve root means in a back issue. Please explain.

I suppose it could be due to an old infection, may be tuberculosis (primary) which went unnoticed and it has nothing to do with the present situation.

She vomits up everything she eats. She did not eat anything from mid-morning. We tried giving her some baby oatmeal and she would not even eat at all. We gave her that in the evening after trying her usual 6 OZ bottle that she did not take even an ounce of it. She went to sleep at 11 last night and did not get up today until afternoon even after I tried waking her all morning. Her soft spot seems fine. This has been going on for about a week now. I took her to the doctor and they told me all was well. If all was well, why she is not eating? She has no fever. No weight loss. She also has not been urinating as often as she should. I only have to change her once or twice a day. She does not seem dehydrated. She has completely white eyes. She jerks her arms and legs pretty hard as if she is having a seizure?

I feel no pain in the tooth. Please suggest.","Doctor":"Hello. First of all, based on your age, it must be definitely a retained deciduous or primary tooth as it is mobile, because rarely in this age tooth mobility can occur (unless you have any gum disease).

Regarding your successor or follow up permanent teeth, by this age you must have 28 teeth, apart from your retained milk tooth. The OPG or periapical radiograph will help to check the position of the permanent tooth if it has not erupted, which will help in diagnosing and planning the treatment as well. Coming on to your ankylosis section, since it is mobile, I guess it is not ankylosed. But, in any case, if it is a deciduous tooth, you have to get it removed. Do not worry. You will be fine.

It can happen at various sites like the buttocks, heels, foot, rib area, lower back, and neck. Since none of your joints are involved, it does not look like rheumatoid arthritis. But considering enthesitis inflammation and your age group, it is always advisable to do inflammatory markers like ESR (erythrocyte sedimentation rate), CRP (C-reactive protein) and get tested for HLA B27 (human leucocyte antigen). I am not sure if anti-inflammatory work in your case, but when the pain happens you can try it. Also, check for your vitamin D levels once to be sure the fatigue is not due to its deficiency.

I would normally have big stools, and go often daily, sometimes every other day, and rarely once every three days. I have been having more frequent bowel movements, but they have become much smaller and also have hematuria. My PCP first informed me of hematuria a week ago, and a urologist today confirmed it was still there but there was less blood than last time. I have been having urinary issues, which the urologist suggested is because of bowel problems, and directed me to speak with a naturopath. I had a prostate exam (which was fine), and a bladder scan to ensure it was emptying. I took Colace in the evening, and the next morning I had very thick, greasy creamy stool. After eating cheerios for breakfast I experienced discomfort and gas all day long. Today, I had minor gas and discomfort, and I am experiencing a decrease in appetite, and I have lost 4 lbs in the last week. In each of the stools, I noticed solid, reddish-orange chunks that I tried to break in my tissue, which almost felt like a gummy bear. I also had corn in my last few bowel movements, which I ate the before evening. Is it possible I am suffering from low digestive enzymes? I had a frequency in urination as well, and I am drinking 50 oz of water roughly ever day. Could I have hematuria due to intestinal bleeding? After each bowel movement, I still feel like I have more to release. I have an appointment with a naturopath and looking for relief sooner though. I have done CT scan, x-ray and blood tests.","Doctor":"Hello. I had gone through all the data you have posted. There is no such intestinal cause for hematuria. Hematuria may be microscopic or macroscopic.Microscopic can be known only through urine examination, as you told that you were told to have hematuria I suppose you have microscopic hematuria. The common cause for hematuria is calculus in the urinary system anywhere along kidneys down till the bladder and urethra, glomerulonephritis or pyelonephritis (infection in the kidney), or taking warfarin oral anticoagulation. Kindly repeat a complete urine examination after five days and ask to look for dysmorphic RBC (red blood cells) in the urine. Coming to your second problem stools, for passage of stools freely kindly increase dietary fiber content in your diet and stay yourself hydrated. Stool like chunks indicates low dietary fiber content and low water content. eat fruits like banana, orange, watermelon. You can try powder Lactihusk which contains dietary fiber. If it does not work then, you need to take laxatives like Cremaffin (Paraffin and milk of magnesia) syrup or Sodium picosulfate syrup. Avoid spicy foods, drink plenty of water, including fruits and vegetables in your diet. Intestinal enzyme deficiency is commonly seen in patients with pancreatitis.

Well, it seems like you developed a reaction to Enbrel which is quite common as it does flare psoriasis in some patients. Pertaining to your queries: Since you have mentioned only one ankle is swollen, it is not justified taking such a high dose of steroids. Considering the patient is 10-year-old, it will hamper the growth and height of the patient. Firstly, one needs to see, if there is an effusion left or there is synovial thickening due to prolonged inflammation. The thickening will not respond to the injections or the steroids. Also, if only ankle is the problem then, consult an orthopedic and you may want some synovectomy done to relieve the inflammation if the other methods have failed. If 20 mg is not working, it is very less likely higher doses will work. My suggestion is to get orthopedic advice. It is hard to say but normally one year of the swelling can damage the joint. If the disease is too aggressive, may be two months are enough. Always a tough thing to call for. US (ultrasound) of the ankle. Orthopedic intervention."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am 22 years old. I need the treatment for physical urticaria by heat, physical effort, and tension.","Doctor":"Hello. You told me about your problem of physical urticaria. Tests advised are CBC (complete blood count), ESR (erythrocyte sedimentation rate), ANA (antinuclear antibody), cryoglobulin, HBsAg (hepatitis B virus antigen), anti-HCV Ab (hepatitis C antibody). The first thing you should keep in mind is that there is no cure for cholinergic urticaria, and the treatment options are often limited. It is a chronic condition and will need long term treatment. You can have two or more different types of urticaria at the same time. Physical urticarias by heat, sun exposure are mainly due to cholinergic urticarias. They are responsive to most common antihistamines like Levocetirizine, Desloratidine, and Cetirizine. The first line of treatment and most important is to avoid the triggers and physical agents like chemicals, latex, cosmetics, plants, ointments, and stress. Also try to avoid exercise, heat, high temperature (fever), emotion or eating spicy food. You need to modify your diet and try to avoid hot drinks, hot foods and spiced foods. This gives a lot of relief in symptoms. Even tablet Danazol 200 mg twice daily is helpful in many cases. A dose of an antihistamine just before you do exercise may help to prevent or limit a flare-up of the rash. The use of cooling sprays, ice packs, or other materials may help to quickly resolve oncoming reactiions. Tablet Cyclosporin may be worth trying for antihistamine-resistant DU (demographic urticaria), especially in those patient cases characterized by severe itching. Unlike most other types of urticaria, physical urticaria is not usually helped by steroids. So better you avoid steroids in any form. It is not possible to predict how long the problem will last. In some cases, the condition may last for many years. In most cases, by avoiding the trigger and by taking antihistamines, the condition can be controlled. So a lot of patience is required before you get full relief. Meditation, prayer, or using mental relaxation techniques may help individuals to cope with attacks or the stress of living with the condition."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am 23 years old.

I need your suggestion.","Doctor":"Hello,  Welcome to icliniq.com.  I have gone through your reports. (attachment removed to protect patient identity). It is confirmed that you have PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease) and endometriosis as well considering the large 10 cm cyst in the left ovary. Now, this cyst can be laparoscopically removed under experienced hands and then you can be placed on progesterone-only pills for at least three months for further control of endometriosis, and also on Myo inositol supplements for three months simultaneously to control PCOD as well. Post treatment there would be a good chance to conceive in the next six months with an ovulation induction and an IUI (intrauterine insemination) procedure and may even timed intercourse would prove fruitful.  But that endometriotic cyst would have to be removed as that shall not regress with medications, not more than 3-4 cm in the next three to six months. Surgery would be mandatory and I still advise the laparoscopic approach considering primary infertility."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor,I am just wondering what is abutting and abutment of the nerve root means in a back issue.

Secondary lactose intolerance is more commonly associated with bacterial overgrowth which ferments and produce more gas. Avoid dairy products and take Rifaximin 550 mg 1-0-1 for seven days, this helps to clear the bacteria form gut and may help to decrease farts.

I later underwent a liver scan and the conclusion was Child A Cirrhosis-possibly secondary to NASH. Advised to lose weight with no medication prescribed. Yesterday, I underwent a FibroTouch scan and result showed liver stiffness of 19.9 kPa and UAP(dB/m) of 279. Meanwhile, for the past one year I have been taking daily supplements of Milk Thistle, Gluthathione and lately Magnesium Bisglycinate, (for cramps and muscle weakness), and Vitamin E. I was also once told that I may have high inflammation due to autoimmune-related problem possibly due to a weak gut (leaky gut). All not really validated through any test. Apart from deciding to go aggressive with my weight loss initiative and eating more plant based food, I am at a loss as to what to do to reverse the stage 4 fibrosis from worsening. I am going plant based because of the testimonies of those who adopted the diet lifestyle and had a change for the better in their conditions. My family is worried that I may not have the chance to live long. I am almost 62 now. What do you advice that I should do to recover from this?","Doctor":"Hi. You have investigated by fibroscan report (attachment removed to protect patient identity). The 19 kpa is suggestive of grade 4 fibrosis in liver. The fibrosis can from due to chronic inflammation. The NASH is form of hepatitis due to overweight. So, fibrosis can develop in NASH as well and so liver can be more stiff. However, your high kpa and UAP are suggestive of early cirrhosis change. So, you need to lose weight first. The Ursodeoxycholic acid can be prescribed for your condition. You need to be monitored regularly by gastroenterologist.

The crowns are metal with light porcelain on the outside. The teeth have felt fine ever since, until a few days ago. Now I feel pain in the right molar tooth whenever some warm food touches it. The pain takes a second or two to come, it is not instant on contact. Cold food or drinks cause no pain, neither does chewing. The gums around the crowned teeth are irritated, and look like they are possibly pulling down away from the teeth as I can see the dark metal underpart at the gum line. The tooth on the left side does not hurt at all aside from the irritated look of the gums around it. After doing some reading, I think a possibility is that the root canal did not get all the pulp in the right side tooth, and that is now infected again. I do not currently have dental or medical insurance and it may be a few months later I can see a dentist. What can I do in the meantime to take care of the tooth? I also became aware that I grind and click my teeth a lot without realizing it, and possibly at night when I sleep. My front teeth all look worn down now. This is concerning me a lot. I looked into teeth guards for sleeping, but the ones I found in stores need to be heated and placed between teeth to shape them to my mouth, and with my current heat sensitivity I can not use them.","Doctor":"Hello. I have read your query and it is pretty much clear that the right molar with history of RCT (root canal treatment) is causing the pain. Now the causes of pain may be a re-infection or incomplete RCT, but there can be other causes as well. As you mentioned you have bruxism (teeth grinding), the tooth or in this case the RCT tooth is under continuous insult from the grinding habit. This may have also caused the injury to the surrounding tissues. A prosthetic crown or porcelain crown here if not in occlusion may also be another cause for the pain.  Now as you mentioned that you are having pain only on taking warm foods and liquid diet and the gums around the crown is receding (recession), it looks like you might be having tooth sensitivity in the nearby tooth due to the dentin exposure caused by recession. An x-ray of the tooth will make the things more clear as if a new RCT is required or you just need proper cleaning and fluoride toothpaste. If it is possible, do upload a picture of the tooth and also x-ray of the tooth. Meanwhile, I would suggest you to use fluoride-containing toothpaste and ultrasoft toothbrush. Do not scrub, clean your teeth and gums gently. Maintain good oral health."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am a 34-year-old female. Kindly expain my NT scan and double marker test result. PAAP -A - 3.37 miU/ml. HCG, free beta - 147.00 ng/ml. NT value - 1.40mm. Trisomy 21 - 1:227.","Doctor":"Hello. Let me explain to you first why this report is done and what it is about. Basically it is a screening test and results of that do not indicate that baby has a problem. It just indicate that what are the chances of your baby to have some congenital anomalies like Down's syndrome, Patau syndrome, Turner syndrome, Edward syndrome. These all are congenital syndromes and the baby can have minor to major congenital birth defects if you continue the pregnancy. These chances are given in result in terms of 1:227 as in your case about Down's syndrome. This means according to the available data with report value of your blood, sonography findings, age, and other factors there are chances of getting pregnancy positive with Down's syndrome is 1 out of 227 pregnancy like yours with matching factors. So it also means that out of 227 pregnancy like yours, 226 pregnancy are still normal and there is no problem in baby. When the report is below cut off value which is 1:250, report is given as high risk and otherwise low risk. So in cases of high risk reports we have to do the confirmatory test to check whether the baby has Down's syndrome or not in your case. And for confirmation, we have to take baby cells directly and test for karyotyping. For obtaining baby cells we usually remove liquid around baby under sonography guidance and sent this liquid for the test. They will separate the baby cells from the liquid and do test on it. But for removing the liquid we have to puncture through the abdomen and it has its own risk. This procedure is called amniocentesis. And due to this risk, we have to segregate high risk and low risk and do test only at high risk for confirmation. But for you, one positive thing is that in the value of percentage there is more than 99% chance that the baby does not have any problem with the report 1:227. I have also seen patients with 1:5 reports and which turns out normal after amniocentesis. So at the same time, it is positive as well as negative news for the couple. But we have to go forward with this. I hope this helps."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am a 32-year-old female. Last night out of nowhere I started having a pain suddenly under my ribs on the left side. About an hour later pain developed in my upper back on the left side. I did not fall or lift or hit anything that would cause this pain. Currently, there is no nausea or vomiting. I know this pain is much different from any other pain I have felt. The pain seems to be connected as it is wrapping or radiating around from the abdomen to back. While the pain is not yet excruciating it is still very bothersome and uncomfortable. I could compare the feeling to beg deeply bruised. It almost feels like I was kicked hard in the abdomen and back. I am dealing with something autoimmune but right now it is labeled as UCTD (undifferentiated connective tissue disease). I think it could be related. My concern is that it could be pancreatitis. Do I need to go to the ER? Does pancreatitis progress slowly? This is day two and I do not want to get to the point of excruciating pain.","Doctor":"Hello. I read through your concern. The pain what you experience may not be due to pancreas as you feel as usually it will get referred to the right side. There is something like spasm between your intercoastal muscles that will lead to same symptoms and pain that you described, and limited movement of ribs to give rise to associated stiffness and pain in thorax and abdomen. So, I recommend you to keep icing over the painful area. Drink plenty of water with ORS (oral rehydration solution), keep sipping water. Stay calm and relax. You can lie down if it is comfortable. As you take medication dehydration can occur leading to cramps and spasms. I hope this helps."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, My son is 10 years old.

Generally, height is a genetically programmed component, it depends on both parents height. You can calculate the expected height of your child with a formula for mid-parental height. I agree he is below the normal height level for his age, you can consult an endocrinologist and get him evaluated. Meanwhile, encourage him to participate in sports and do stretching exercises.

They did an ultrasound, bloodwork, etc., she followed up with her OB the next day. The OB really did not seem concerned, and she put her on pelvic rest and scheduled a follow up for two and a half weeks out. She continued to bleed (mostly brownish blood), sometimes heavier and sometimes almost nothing she said. She measured right on schedule and the heart rate was good. I am not sure if the radiology report is saying that there are one or two hypoechoic areas. Can you determine? Also, she said that she passed a couple of clots, but the blood has been brown blood for the most part. What I want to know is, is this a subchorionic hemorrhage? Also, based on the details, how much more at risk for miscarriage or pre-term delivery does this put us? The OB said that this does not put her at any higher risk for miscarriage, but from what I am seeing online, I believe that. She had her previous delivery without any bleeding issues, but she did have pre-eclampsia and Hellp syndrome on 39 weeks when she was induced. Here is what the radiology report says: The amniotic fluid volume is within normal limits on inspection. The placenta is posterior, fundal, and grade 0. No placenta previa. No low-lying placenta. No placental abruption is seen. Hypoechoic area is adjacent to the gestational sac in the cervical region. The cervix measures 2.9 cm in length. The hypoechoic area within the cervix measuring 2.9 x 1.1 x 0.7. The maternal right and left adnexa were not evaluated. Impression: 1. Single live intrauterine gestation as noted above. No suspicious findings. 2. Hypoechoic area adjacent to the gestational sac in the cervical region is compatible with a bleed. Hypoechoic area within the cervix measuring 2.9 x 1.1 x 0.7 is compatible with blood products. Recommended attention to these findings on follow up ultrasound.","Doctor":"Hello,  Welcome to iclinq.com.  Thanks for sharing this information with us. You are right that hypoechoic area on the scan corresponds to the bleed but as far as this bleed is concerned there is no way to stop it and in my opinion as your wife has already progressed to 15 weeks the chances of miscarriage are reduced a lot rather there are chances of having pre term labor in the later half of pregnancy. So for that her gynecologist should keep an eye on her, and you have mentioned that she was having pre-eclampsia in last pregnancy then in my opinion she must have been started on Aspirin 75 mg in this pregnancy to reduce the chances of developing pre-eclampsia and also reduces formation of clots elsewhere in the vascular system which is definitely helpful for now. I might say that your wife can discuss having tablet Duphaston (Dydrogesterone) and Aspirin with her doctor and they can come up with the best advice for her health. Pelvic rest is the only thing that can be done for now as she is in her early pregnancy.  I hope this helps."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor,I am just wondering what is abutting and abutment of the nerve root means in a back issue. Please explain.

Regarding your short history, it seems that you may be having a gingival abscess or pericoronitis (if the last erupting tooth is involved).

Still, it seems that you are having an infection and the lymph nodes are involved which relates the lump on the left side. The sore on the gum may be an aphthous ulcer or sinus opening as both are white, but sinus opening might be somewhat eruptive (nodule like). The sore throat is due to the infectious condition. So I think it might be a gingival abscess. The treatment requires a regime of antibiotics, analgesics and mouth wash. You can take Amoxycillin 500 mg and Clavulanic acid 125 mg two times (BD) for five days.

Your blood pressure exceeds these limits and it seems as you are suffering from stage one to two hypertension. Hypertension is a very important problem as it causes other serious illnesses over time. You are very young and so it is of tremendous importance to lower your blood pressure. Fortunately, you may be able to do this without any medication. I suggest the following: Eat a low-sodium diet. Lose weight. Go for a walk 30 minutes a day. Limit alcohol and if you are smoking try to quit it. Please measure your blood pressure for one week once in the morning, if possible before doing any activity and once in the evening. And write it down. After one week your measurements should be checked. After one month of low-sodium diet, exercise and three to four lost pounds, you should repeat this blood pressure measurement. If there is no improvement some lab tests should be done. If your symptoms did not improve in the following days, or if your headache worsens abruptly you should be examined by a doctor.

I also had surgery previously on my face to reconstruct an impacted orbital bone and maxillary sinus on the left side of my face. Following the surgery, on my sinuses and septum, I had a clear thin liquid that would drip from only my right nostril when I would bend down or bend over to get something. It was a very thin liquid and I assumed it was just fluid draining from the surgery and that it was normal. Since then the draining has continued to happen when I bend over. I was never told by my ENT that a CSF leak was a potential complication that could occur with this surgery but after researching this symptom I have found out otherwise. I have a follow up scheduled with my ENT doctor but that is not for another month and a half. Is there a potential that it could be a CSF leak? Could it be still recovering from the surgery? Should I look to see if I can see someone sooner than a month and a half?","Doctor":"Hello. With a septal correction and turbinate reduction surgery the chances of causing a CSF (cerebrospinal fluid) leak as complications are remote because CSF leak occurs when you disrupt the skull base and in the surgeries you mentioned we do not touch the skull base. However, you have mentioned in one place that it is sinus surgery. Sinus surgery does have CSF leak as one of the dreaded complications. Could you pull out the exact details of your surgery and let us know? If possible can you upload the preoperative sinus CT scan films and report for us to check. Before we panic, get the fluid collected in a clean sterile container and check for sugar and beta transferrin. These two tests will help us know whether the fluid is nasal discharge or CSF. If it is CSF indeed then you need to immediately get it corrected. CSF leak denotes there are potential leak and opening in the base of the skull and that any infection or bacteria can easily pass on the nose to the brain."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I have multiple small cysts in both ovaries (PCOS). Our family friend suggested me to consume Kalarchikai medicine, powdered mixed with pepper and honey to have it for one mandalam (48 days). I have completed nearly 44 days by consuming one small ball of the mixture every morning and before two weeks I got my periods. Then I had checked whether the cysts were dissolved by having an abdomen scan. But still, small multiple follicules have been seen in it with both ovaries enlarged. Kindly suggest me what I can do further. I got married before one and a half years and I am much worried about my pregnancy. I have gallstones as well.","Doctor":"Hello. I just read your query. See Kalarachi Kai choornam is helpful in amenorrhea. As far as small cysts are concerned they are unmatured eggs which failed to induce menstrual cycle previously, as a result, they got collected in the ovary and they will remain in the ovary. Now, you have got your periods you can start trying for conception. But I advise you to do it under the supervision of a nearby gynecologist because egg size is important while conception and that you can know by ovulation study. Ovulation study is performed under the supervision of a gynecologist. For gall stones, surgical intervention is required generally. Medicine is not of much help."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I began having frequent urination, and sometimes urinating every half an hour. I consulted my doctor and UTI was ruled out. I consulted a urologist and she did an abdominal and pelvic CT scan and no structural abnormalities were found. No cystoscopy was performed. She diagnosed me as having an overactive bladder and gave me Trospium and I am taking Estrace and Clonazepam along with that. I have some relief since taking Trospium, but I have been having urethral discomfort. Is this possibly because of the Trospium? Would the CT scan have shown any problems with the urethra? I did a urine culture and blood test also.","Doctor":"Hello,  Welcome to icliniq.com. You have been diagnosed as OAB (overactive bladder) since you had lower urinary tract storage symptoms. You need one USG KUB (ultrasound of kidney, ureter and bladder) and PVR (post-void residue) to look for post-void residual urine. You need to undergo uroflowmetry to see whether you have obstructed voiding pattern or not. Urine CS (culture test) is also required to exclude UTI (urinary tract infection). If you do not have UTI or obstructed flow or increased PVR we can suspect your symptoms as OAB. Now you were rightly prescribed Tropsium. Estrogen cream also helps to vitalize the local tissue and decreases local tissue irritation, decreases dryness in the vagina and periurethral area. If your symptoms are still not controlled with anticholinergics, then we can add Mirabegron 50 mg. Timing may be adjusted according to the severity of your symptom complex. I would sincerely suggest you go to one urologist's office and get investigated and treated. I have tried to guide you regarding treatment options. You need to maintain a voiding diary too, ideally for seven days, but at least for three days to know the pattern of your water intake and voiding frequency and volume. It will help your urologist to understand your disease process in a better way. Urine CS, uroflowmetry, USG KUB, PVR, and serum creatinine."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, Four months post fusion surgery, I am having bilateral leg pain, burning sensations in legs down to feet, and nerve-like jolts in the left leg and numbness in toes and bottom feet. Wondering possibly arachnoiditis?","Doctor":"Hello. Spine and lower back surgery is a procedure that can have variable post operative outcomes. It is found that in approximately 40 percent of patients, the symptoms are completely relieved after surgery. In another 40 percent, the symptoms might show mild improvement. In 20 percent of patients, there is a minimal improvement and the pain might even worsen after surgery. The above is only an estimation and does not question the surgical skills of the surgeon in any way. The problems with pain after surgery can be due to many reasons. It is possible that there is granulation tissue formed in the surgery area which is causing pressure on the nerve. Arachnoiditis is a less common complication and is likely only if there is a dural tear during the surgery. If your surgical notes do not mention any dural tear then arachnoiditis is unlikely. Usually, a repeat MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) spine of the involved area is required to know the cause of pain and burning in your case."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, My nose got hit about a week ago and I got a bloody nose. Usually, when I get bloody noses I just leave it and it heals by itself but this time was diffrent. The next couple of days I could not breathe right through my left nostril, my nose kept dripping clear fluid and for some reason, I kept sneezing a lot. I had a bad headache the first couple of days and it is still a bit sore. Now that the swelling has gone down it looks like my nose is off to the left. Is it broken or fractured? Can it be fixed in an ENT office? And around how much would it cost because I do not think my insurance will cover it. I am trying to get it fixed as soon as I can because I do not want it to heal wrong.","Doctor":"Hello. You seem to be having a septal or nasal bone fracture. These fractures are visible in an x-ray. We usually correct the features within a day of it occurring. After that time fibrosis sets in and we do not attempt to correct until three months when healing tissue has fully formed. Subsequently, we can get a CT (computed tomography) scan of the nose and PNS (paranasal sinus) and do a septorhinoplasty surgery to correct any deformity. Nextly, clear fluid dripping from the nose after a trauma like yours is a cause for worry as it can be CSF (cerebrospinal fluid). CSF is localized in brains and meninges covering the brain. It should not come out through the nose. If it does, it means some defect in the body confines of CSF and it has to be plugged. Otherwise, infection can rise up to the brain. For the above issues, it is best to visit an ENT doctor asap. In my practice, I will ideally do an MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) cisternography for CSF leak and also CSF fluid suggest estimation and CSF fluid beta transferrin examination. If it is found it is indeed CSF, then I do an endoscopic correction of the leak. The deviated septum and nasal deformity are secondary to CSF problem in the severity of the condition.  I hope this helps."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am a 21-year-old female. I have a lump in my neck for about nine weeks now. It is between my hyoid bone and sternocleidomastoid muscle on the right anterior triangle of my neck. It is palpable when I tilt my head back. It is probably as big as a penny but not as round as a penny. It is oval shaped and non-tender. when I first noticed it, it was the size of a kidney bean but then two weeks later it shrunk down to the size of a baked bean and has stayed this size for seven weeks now. It never went back to kidney bean size and it is been two months I noticed the lump. It will move left and right, but not up and down. It feels firm when I tilt my head back but soft when I have my head upright normally. When my head is tilted back and I put my fingers on it, I can feel a pulse. But when I put my fingers on the other side of the neck I can feel a pulse in the same spot, where there is no lump. Just curious as to what this could be? I do not feel any other lumps or bumps that are larger than a pea size, and I am not sick and I was not sick when I first spotted the lump either. Does this sound like lymphoma to you, considering the location, and shape and what it is doing? From what I read, hodgkins lymphoma is common in my age group but rare overall. I do not have any other symptoms (fever, night sweats, weight loss, loss of appetite) other than just a random lump in the middle of my neck.","Doctor":"Hello. I understand your concern regarding this lump. I also understand that you have gone through the internet trying to get an approximate diagnosis for the same. As per your history and description, it appears that this lump is arising from superficial structures of the neck, as it is mobile. It could be muscle. The pulsation which you are feeling are probably due to carotid artery beneath it and is quite normal to feel its pulsation. At this time to relieve your anxiety, it will be best to get a radiological evaluation. In my opinion, MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) or CT (computed tomography) neck will be a good option. Also, I will suggest getting a thyroid function test. In case, getting an appointment for CT or MRI is difficult for some reason, then even an ultrasound neck can give you a clue regarding the origin. Meeting a surgeon will be helpful at this moment."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I have a dull pain on the left side of the abdomen that comes and goes. I had the same pain before 10 years.

Gluten allergy presents with symptoms of weight loss, abdomen pain, anemia, recurrent loose stools.

I have feelings of pending failure, feelings of inadequacy, fear of rejection, fear of police, fear of persecution, lots of mental ambition but no energy to actually do anything because I am convinced I would fail, near constant nightmares about being in jail often without knowing why or being hunted down by people determined to kill or imprison me again without knowing why. Occasional ED which I attribute to the antidepressants, obesity, cholesterol and sleep apnea, and fear of emotional intimacy and talking about my private self. I have been diagnosed by the VA with dysthymia depression and at a non VA psychiatric hospital after a suicide attempt with PTSD, which the VA says I am not. My research tend to point more towards C-PTSD and I have an inability to trust people especially authority, I often feel as though there is an orchestrated conspiracy against me, but grounded enough in reality to know that makes little sense, but often cannot shake the feelings and have a number of instances in my life that simply reinforce that thinking. I fear criticism and rejection from those I should be closest to like my wife and mother. Desire intimacy but have none, being more emotionally intimate, but not cybersex just erotic conversation, with strangers on the internet because of anonymity. I never use my real name online. That is background information. Anyway my question is about the medicines but it just seems like so much and I tend to distrust the VA doctors but have no other healthcare options.

Bupropion is a good antidepressant and very safe although it can cause insomnia, anxiety and dizziness as side effects in few patients but it would decrease on its own. Sertaline is an SSRI drug. As an antidepressant, Sertraline is so potent at stimulating the brain that it can cause anxiety with initial use. But it goes off after some time. Using a Benzodiazepine like Alprazolam for the initial 10 days of treatment with Sertraline. Once you get used to it you may taper the Alprazolam and stop it. Sertraline would continue. You can talk to your psychiatrist regarding this.

Two weeks ago I have had strep throat and doctor gave me 10 dose antibiotics but my sore throat came back on my left side and it hurts my ear and throat when I swallow still. What could this be? They did a swab for the throat but no strep but what else is this? I have a minor cough.","Doctor":"Hello. With the conversation I understand that you had suffered sore throat for which swab was done and appropriate antibiotic was initiated. Now again you have developed sore throat, more so on left side, with ear ache while swallowing. Most probably there is inflammation which has not fully got resolved. Since throat tests are negative, we can conclude that there is no active infection. But infectious products may be remaining causing the body to produce counter products (inflammatory response). The same is causing you the troubles. Since the back of throat is connected to ear through the eustachian tube, it pains in the ear also. The local congestion has blocked the tube impairing normal ventilation and drainage of middle ear. I suggest you the following which if you take you will find relief. Anti-inflammatory tablets of Trypsin-Chymotrypsin and Rutopside/Bromelain combination, taken before food twice a day for 5 days. Also painkillers Paracetamol/Acetaminophen appropriate dosage will do. To relieve ear ache and eustachian tube obstruction you may use nasal decongestant drops (Xylometazoline). Take three drops in one nostril and lie down with head tilted towards that side ear 45 degres, the drops will percolate inside to the eustachian tube orifice and decongest the same. Repeat the same in other nostril and do this twice daily for 3 or 4 days. Follow it up with steam inhalation. Also use warm saline gargles few times daily as it soothes the area inflamed and help reduce edema and congestion. I would suggest you stop smoking (if you do), avoid spicy foods and take plenty of hot fluids. If still after 5 days of these measures you do not find relief, it is advisable to consult an otolaryngologist. If you do not find improvement after this then we have to rule out reflux laryngitis, chronic sinusitis and few other conditions which may be triggering constant throat issue in you."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor,I have enlarged spleen from the last two years.

The various causes for enlarged spleen include infection like malaria, Gaucher disease like storage disorder, hemolytic anemia, leukemia, lymphoma, infections, liver disease, etc. The CBC and peripheral smear examination report do not suggest leukemia. Hemolytic anemia also can be excluded as bilirubin level is normal. Liver disease chance also very less as reports are normal related to that (attachment removed to protect patient identity). As you have persistent spleen enlargement, it is advisable to investigate with spleen biopsy or FNAC for histopathology examination.

She was under these drops for one month but after stopping the use of those drops she was having severe eye pain with redness. So, we went to the doctor again and he prescribed Prednisolone eye drop for multiple times a day. But when she completes the dose of Prednisolone, then again she gets the same eye pain and redness. And the doctor again prescribed the same Prednisolone drop with high dose (every hour) but we know that Prednisolone is not good for long time use as it is steroid. So, in this circumstances I am seeking your kind suggestion on the above. Please suggest us what should we do.","Doctor":"Hello. Your mother has post operative uveitis which happens in some patients after cataract surgery. The treatment is: 1. We try to find out any cause for recurrent inflammation. If there is no cause then we treat the inflammation. If there is some inciting factor present (like IOL in sulcus irritating iris, vitreous loss, etc.), then we treat the cause. 2. Only treatment available is steroids (best steroid is Prednisolone). If recurrent inflammation then we start with high dose and taper slowly. 3. I would like to add Nepafenac eyedrop because recurrent inflammation may cause cystoid macular edema. 4. Yes, you are right. Steroids if used for long time can cause glaucoma but do not worry. If patient is not sensitive to steroids then intraocular pressure will not increase in this short duration. 5. Moreover, your surgeon will keep assessing pressure inside eye and will stop steroids if pressure increases. So, please do not worry and keep medication as per your surgeon instructions."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am a 32-year-old male with no major past medical history to speak of.

Since then I have been on and off on birth control pills and said Depo-Provera shot. I stopped getting my Depo shot four years back and I have not been on any method of birth control since. I only had my period twice after discontinuing the shot. The last time I had my period was four years back and then I spotted the whole entire first week of the very next month. Since then I have not had any type of spotting or bleeding. Of course, I need to be having a menstrual cycle in order to conceive but I am just in desperate need and I feel so hopeless because I feel like I am not be able to have any kids or if I do it will be in a long time.

A regular cycle signifies a normal ovulation and thus a fertile status. I presume you are suffering from anovulation, which means absence of ovulation. There are 100 causes of anovulation whereas the most common cause of anovulation is polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS), a complex endocrine disorder of uncertain etiology, where ovaries turn into cystic structures. Other causes are obesity, thyroid disorders, underweight, anorexia nervosa, stress, overt exercise, and usage of some medications. You have a body weight only 40 kg with BMI 17.28 (attachment removed to protect patient identity). This is a bit lower than normal weight.You were on antidepressant, which you have left, also which could cause anovulation. Are you suffering from any psychiatric illness still now? These all could cause anovulation and amenorrhoea. You have taken also Depo shot one year back. I do not know why you had taken, but this medicine itself can cause absence of cycle. Whatever may be the reason, you need a detailed evaluation. You need to increase your body weight, need hormonal screening (LH, FSH, thyroid, prolactin, testosterone) and an USG screening for polycystic ovaries. Just get a regular cycle and then try to conceive when you will achieve this. Anovulation. 1. Serum level of LH, FSH, prolactin, thyroid, testosterone. 2.

Pregnancy is a delicate phase, you should not take it lightly. You should not take any medication without any opinion from your treating physician. Anxiety associated with flu-like symptoms can be due to an underlying medical condition (such as infection). Hence you should seek an opinion from your gynaecologist as well. Zoloft is a safer drug for anxiety, but still you should take opinion before taking it on your own. Medical causes are more common etiological causes for anxiety, they must be ruled out first.

I have never smoked. I am not overweight and I do not have diabetes. I have been having some left leg issues. It started six months back. I started limping because my left calf, ankle and groin were hurting. My emergency Doppler venous ultrasound was clear. I had a D-dimer and that was negative. I had an MRI of my left ankle that showed a talofibular ligament sprain on my left ankle. I also had an arterial Doppler ultrasound that showed decreased flow of left anterior tibial artery and increased peak systolic velocity in the left common femoral artery. But, there was no stenosis, no sclerosis and no plaque. Could the sprain have caused that decreased flow? After three months, it became normal again. Then, while having pedicure the woman massaged my ankle and leg. Since then the pain has returned to my left ankle and left leg. I had another D-dimer done three weeks ago that was negative. I have also recently started experiencing cold left foot and a left cold lower leg at night. By morning, both the legs as well as the feet are of the same temperature. I do get pain in the buttocks and the pain is going down my leg like a sciatic pain on the left leg. Do I have peripheral artery disease? Could a blood clot be causing it? I have a four hours flight next week and I am worried about flying. Is it safe to fly? Would the arterial Doppler and D-dimer be able to tell if I have a blood clot in my artery? Or is a D-dimer just for the veins? My LDL was 10 points above normal in my last blood test. But, my doctor did not seem to be concerned as my HDL was high. I have attached the reports for your reference. Please help me.","Doctor":"Hi. From your description, I understand that the first time you had a problem with your left leg was due to a sprain (talofibular ligament) around the ankle and it got resolved. I suspect the same problem or something similar is causing you the pain again. It is highly unlikely for a 33 year old lady and a non-smoker to have a peripheral vascular disease. The arterial Doppler did show a decreased blood flow, but it might be due to a temporary spasm of the vessel than any specific pathology or disease. Moreover, no clot was found nor was there any change suggesting peripheral vascular disease. It is absolutely safe to fly and you need not worry about it. An arterial Doppler will be able to make out if you have a clot. D-dimer test is only for the veins and is not useful in arterial disease. I suggest you to look for causes either in your footwear or any strain which you have put repeatedly on your ankle causing repeated sprain in the left ankle. You can get an orthopedic consultation to be sure of the same. If he or she does not find any problem and your pain persists even after appropriate treatment then further evaluation can be done by a vascular surgeon. But, I do feel you may not require it.

I have gone through your query and can understand your health concern. As per your query, the pregnancy test was negative. So, no need to worry. It is not a miscarriage. To be on a safer side and to confirm that it is not miscarriage, I suggest you to check your serum beta-hCG (human chorionic gonadotropin) level. High levels confirm pregnancy. You can do this test if you are in doubt. Menstruation can be delayed due to many factors. Such as hormonal imbalance and stress can delay menses. Sometimes, delayed menses can cause heavy bleeding.

He had brachytherapy radiation last summer. Through surgery, they removed the rectum, surrounding mesorectal fat and involved lymph nodes. Pathology declared radiation to be a complete response and no cancer found. FOLFOX chemo has begun before 14 months for every two weeks to prevent metastatic cancer. Patient also has an aneurysm in his ascending aorta of 5.3 cm which was initially found on a CT scan due to the cancer. Plan is for repair of the aorta. A chest CT scan with contrast was conducted last week in order to follow the growth of the aneurysm that left the following impression. Multiple bilateral pulmonary emboli involving the left lower lobar pulmonary artery, multiple bilateral segmental and subsegmental pulmonary arteries. Patient has no history of emboli. Multiple scans prior to surgery did not reveal such, so these seem to be the result of either the surgery or the chemotherapy itself or a combination. Patient has since been put on 1 mL injections of Lovenox, morning and night.

The ileostomy reversal and the repair of his 5.3 cm thoracic ascending aorta. We were hoping to hear the recommendations in regards to proceeding with the infusion as a result of the most recent finding. Will further infusions slow the reabsorption of the emboli and thus delay necessary surgeries? Thank you for your help, expertise and insight.","Doctor":"Hi.

Now the swelling has gone down a lot but just a little remain. Hardly there is any bruising, but it is still sore, and when I run the top of my foot (when I take the walking boot off to shower) my two middle toes tingle. I am supposed to go back in a week for a checkup. Could there be something else wrong with my ankle that would cause the tingling and still a little bit of swelling too?","Doctor":"Hello,  Welcome to icliniq.com. Yes, you should go to the clinic and see an orthopedic surgeon because after the swelling and pain reduces they can evaluate you better to find a cause. That is if there is any major ligament injury or no, or if it has sprained. The tingling can be due to small nerves getting pinched due to the swelling. So do not worry about that it will reduce. What you need is to wear an ankle stirrup brace, which is light and it will protect your ankle in the healing phase so that the sprained ligaments heal faster. Also, if you have sprained your ankle so many times then you need to do is to strengthen the muscles of your leg, i.e. extensors and flexors of the leg so that it does not happen again. Once you strengthen these muscles it will protect your ankle joint. Also, use an elastocrepe bandage of six inches width from the toes to just below the knee to reduce the swelling. Follow up sos."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am a 25-year-old male. I have short sight and cannot see long-distance, letters, or things. My eyesight power is -2 and -1.75. I am wearing eye glass from 3 years of age but there is no improvement in my eye problem, that is why I am not interested to wear glass. I am a computer worker. Please give me some solution.","Doctor":"Hello. I reviewed your history. You are having myopia of -2 and -1.75 refractive power. This requires correction by the use of spectacles. The use of spectacles will not lead to the improvement of eyesight and reduction of refractive power, but it prevents further increase in refractive power. Since you are a computer worker you need to use spectacles to prevent eye strain. If you still have eye strain it can be because of dryness of the eye caused by the constant use of the computer, and can be treated by use of artificial tears eye drops. The other thing to be considered is an improper correction of refractive error and you need to undergo refraction and correction. If you do not want to wear spectacles you can go for contact lenses, or for refractive laser surgery like lasik. I hope this helps."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I have AF for six years. Tried DCC and got sinus rhythm for 12 months, then back to AF six months ago. My echo showed serious left atrium dilation (more than 200% i.e. 180 ml compared to the normal 60 ml) and mild ventricular dilation. 24 hour tape ranges from tachycardia of up to 120 and bradycardia with up to two seven second pauses per night, but it was stable before one year. My ejection fraction is normal (60%). I have booked to have an ablation. Could you please describe what is the level of risk to life of such serious dilations, and what can be done to get them back to normal?","Doctor":"Hello. I had gone through your query. So as ablation can prevent AF (atrial fibrillation) but the return of atrial size to normal is unlikely. The risk due to atrial dilation in AF is due to the formation of blood clots inside left atrial appendage and chance of embolism producing a stroke. We normally perform transesophageal echocardiogram to rule out the presence of thrombus before considering for DCC (direct current cardioversion). So if the size is more than 4.5 cms and some consider more than 5.5 cms there is a need for anticoagulation (blood thinners) to prevent thte stroke. Some may consider left atrial appendage closure device or surgical removal so that the chance of stroke decreases. So you need to discuss these issues with your consultant cardiologist who is planning ablation. I hope this helps."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, My baby girl is 3.5 years old. She has thalassemia major and her ferritin level is 3000 ng/ml. What food is good for her?","Doctor":"Hello. Based on your query, my opinion is as follows: Iron intake should be reduced. Vegetarian diet will be better as iron content is low. The diet that can be followed include: 1. Importantly avoid vitamin C or citrus food up to four hours after food as it helps in improving iron absorption. 2. Reduce nonvegetarian diet, try to maintain the intake of iron from the overall diet to less than 18 mg per day. 3. Cereals like wheat bran, maize, oats, rice, and soya are helpful. Not sure if she takes, but tea and coffee or even milk during meals will reduce iron absorption. 4. Dairy products like milk, cheese and yogurt which reduce iron absorption, particularly with meals. Make sure, all are non-iron fortified. 5. For the diet, I would recommend cereals, particularly rice, oats or maize along with tea (2 cups). You can vary the diet based on taste. 6. If difficult multivitamin supplementation without an iron will be very helpful with cereals based diet including soy protein.  7. Hemoglobin at all times above 10g% and formation of donor pool is necessary. Regular chelation therapy to avoid iron overload is necessary. Very high iron sources are found in the following foods; they should be avoided or eliminated from the diet: like - Proteins that should be avoided or eliminated from the diet: oysters, liver, pork, beans, beef, peanut butter, tofu. The grains that should be avoided or eliminated from the diet: flour tortillas, infant cereal, cream of wheat, Malt-O-Meal, and cereals, such as Most, Product 19, Total, Kix, All Bran, Life, Raisin Bran, Special K, 100% Bran, Rice Chex, Rice Krispies, Cornflakes, Wheaties, etc. The fruits and vegetables that should be avoided or eliminated from the diet are prune juice, prunes, watermelon, spinach, leafy green vegetables, dates, raisins, broccoli, peas, fava beans, etc. Managing a child with thalassemia is an ongoing job. Try to maintain a good body mass index and hemoglobin should be always above 10g%. Most importantly, try to form a donor pool for regular blood donation from a group of friends or non-related relatives with the same blood group to reduce the risk of antibody formation and also infections. If not sure, contact a transfusion medicine consultant, he will be able to help you more. Ferritin is too high and iron chelation is necessary. Do discuss with your doctor.  I hope this helps."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am having significant neck pain that goes out into my shoulders a bit. Pain is accompanied by severe stiffness. Also, my hands have been falling asleep about seven or eight times a week (roughly) and even ache a bit. I thought I might be dealing with a pinched nerve, but all my symptoms are fairly bilaterally equal. This last week I was put through an MRI for a lipoma in my left shoulder and neck area and they found that I also had a lower cervical syrinx at C6 about 3 mm. Could this be causing the pain and numbness that I have been dealing with? Or is the syrinx something that should be removed? I am awaiting an appointment with a neurosurgeon but I thought I would reach out in the meantime. I appreciate any information that you give me.","Doctor":"Hello. It may very well be the syrinx. A syrinx can cause pain and temperature sensory deficits to occur early but may not be recognized for years. Syringomyelia typically causes numbness, weakness, atrophy, and often fasciculation, and reduced reflexes of the hands and arms. The pain and/or numbness is felt as a sensation in a cakelike distribution over the shoulders, arms, and back. It may be decompressed surgically a bit for that you would need an MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) of the C-spine to look for a more detailed anatomy. I hope this helps."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am 21 years old. I have been wanting to see a doctor for so long but I do not even know where to start from. I have been suffering from the same symptoms for over 15 years. I have been having problems with every single person in my life. My parents, friends most especially and people around. I feel really sad, the kind of sadness that you can literally feel it in your heart. I cry for weeks, people avoid me for weeks, I feel suffocated, I have palpitations, etc. A few years back I felt suicidal and I really do not want to die. I hear voices mostly of my sister crying at night or during the day, and I imagine things happening, me hurting someone or someone I love getting hurt. And I can actually see it happening in front of my eyes. And sometimes the triggers are my surroundings, maybe there is a knife or some cars passing by. And it happens more than 20 times in a day. I really have problems with people especially the people I love the most. I just feel like they genuinely do not like me, or they are just staying with me because I will benefit them in some ways. I have the most problem with my boyfriend, I just find myself in a situation where I just stop talking to him. At some point, he told me I am trying to make him think like me, and I just stop talking to him for no reason and it is like a cycle. One minute I am fine the next I just get in a mood. And it is actually true. My mother calls me a chameleon because of my mood swings. I will be the happiest person on earth, planing my life, my business, listening to motivational videos one time and the next minute I feel worthless, useless, I just do not want to do anything. I am really a problem in people’s lives and they really care about me so much. I think it is best if I just cut everyone out, I am just tired of feeling this way constantly for years. I do not even know how to explain how I feel what is actually happening. I am really scared to talk to people, I feel like they are ignoring me or I am just this worthless person that nobody wants to talk to. When I have a presentation I feel like I am going to die. And this is my final year in dental school. I have never talked to some of my classmates. I feel like the doctors do not even like me, but they have no other choice because I am always with two of my friends who everybody likes.

I have severe body pain that I cannot even sleep at night, palpitations, dizziness, breathing problems, abdominal pain, severe period pain and I wake up at the night gasping for air.

I am tired of feeling this way for years I just want to understand what is wrong with me. Please help.","Doctor":"Hello. I have gone through your concern with interest. It is clear that you have a social anxiety problem and an episode of depression. It is also likely that you have personality traits that result in such behavior. To make the final diagnosis you need to visit a psychiatrist in person. There are mainly two methods to manage your symptoms, first psychotherapy, and second drug therapy. Depending upon your type and severity you need to choose either one or both. Psychotherapy is usually helpful to understand your cause of symptoms and problematic behavior and how you can modify it and learn to manage your stress is a more effective way. Drugs such as antidepressants, a mood stabilizer and antipsychotics can be used to manage your symptoms. So first get an in-person consultation with your psychiatrist.

Since then I have been on 15 mg of Methotrexate and Hydroxychloroquine. Since I have been on medication, I hardly have no symptoms, but recently arthritis seems to be flaring up for three weeks now. I have pain in my feet again, some stiffness and tiredness. Does this mean the Methotrexate is no longer working? My ankle also clicks every time I walk. I am worried about my joint damage? I did my blood test, liver and kidney function tests. All tests are normal. Please advise.","Doctor":"Hello. Well, it is a possibility that Methotrexate dose is not sufficient enough to stop the disease. 15 mg is the dose we use for starting and we normally go higher up. In my experience, 15 mg normally proves inefficient in the long run. But since your disease is flaring, and as you said liver functions are good, you need to increase the dose to 20 mg or 25 mg. Secondly, for the flare you are having, you can take a short course of steroids, Prednisolone 10 mg to be tapered over three weeks and stop. That will help to stop the disease."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, My child is 4.5 years old and very often he suffers from coughing problem which increases as the days passes.

If your child has cough for so long time and he is also requiring nebulization, it means that your child has infection. Also, we need to rule out tuberculosis.

Bodyaches, petechiae (rashes), fatigue and dehydration points towards the diagnosis of dengue fever which may be associated with your other symptoms of sore throat and cough. To confirm that you need to undergo some tests like total blood count (platelet count), DLC, Hb, LFT, KFT. Platelet count generally decreases in dengue fever. You need to hydrate yourself as much as you can and complete bed rest. Prevent yourself from mosquitoes as they are the carriers of this fever. It is a viral fever so no specific medicines needed. You may take analgesics for aches like Paracetamol, avoid Aspirin containing drugs. You might have a fever in the beginning which you must have ignored. If symptoms get worse you may need to see your family physician and may need hospitalization. Get your tests done and follow up as quickly as possible. TLC, DLC, Hb, LFT, KFT.

I was diagnosed seven years ago for central precocious puberty and was treated with three annual implants of Histrelin. The third implant still has not been removed after about four years. I have looked at procedure guidelines online that say that the implant must be removed after a year is up. Does it have to be removed? What will happen if it is not removed? Also, I am showing no signs of puberty except pubic hair and height. Is it possible that the Histrelin is holding my growth?","Doctor":"Hi. Yes, Histrelin implant should have been removed after one year. Please speak about this to your doctor. Histrelin implant is a synthetic analogue of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonist. It works by decreasing the production of certain hormones, which reduces estrogen and testosterone levels in the body initially. Laboratory tests, including luteinizing hormone (LH), follicle stimulating hormone (FSH), estradiol, testosterone levels, or height and bone age may be performed to monitor your progress or to check for side-effects. I would suggest you to carry out all the hormonal profile that is FSH, LH, testosterone levels, thyroid levels, estradiol levels to see that they are in normal range.

Your main presentation is chronic muscle pain and joint pain. For that specific cause rule out first like connective tissue disorder, muscle dystrophy, neuropathic pain, spinal problem, HIV, thyroid issue, etc. For connective tissue panel testing, CT scan, serum TSH (thyroid-stimulating hormone) estimation, serum T4 estimation like investigations are useful.

Aldosterone antagonists Spironolactone, and a beta blocker in case of tachycardia. If these drugs do not help improve her situation, Entresto (Sacubitril / Valsatran) can be added to her therapy.

You did not mention that if your father has been suffering from any other disease or not. In asthma whenever an attack occurs patient usually face breathing difficulties. Stress, headache, and tiredness are caused due to asthma. First of all, try to rule out whether asthma is more aggravated by some food, or it usually happens in some particular season. If it is so, then take extra care of these things. In asthma, an allergic reaction occurs in the body which produces all the symptoms. So try to increase his immunity and avoid any allergen. Give him simple water steam twice or thrice every day. Steam is very beneficial for asthmatic patients. Give him one glass of lukewarm milk along with one teaspoon of turmeric powder every night. If he is not willing to take milk, then you can give him Haridrakhand (ayurvedic preparation of turmeric along with sugar), two teaspoons at night or one teaspoon twice a day with luke warm water. Turmeric is very beneficial in allergic conditions. It helps to relieve his condition. Prepare a decoction of ginger, fennel, a pinch of pepper, holy basal leaves (tulsi) with water and you can add a pinch of sugar in it too. Try to give this decoction once a day. Give him Bresol syrup two teaspoons twice a day for two to four weeks. Give him syrup Septillin two teaspoons twice a day for two to four weeks.

Untreated urinary infections can further lead to pain in the uterus, It could also finally be an infection around the uterus if you had intercourse recently.

I have completed nearly 44 days by consuming one small ball of the mixture every morning and before two weeks I got my periods. Then I had checked whether the cysts were dissolved by having an abdomen scan. But still, small multiple follicules have been seen in it with both ovaries enlarged. Kindly suggest me what I can do further. I got married before one and a half years and I am much worried about my pregnancy. I have gallstones as well.","Doctor":"Hello. I just read your query. See Kalarachi Kai choornam is helpful in amenorrhea. As far as small cysts are concerned they are unmatured eggs which failed to induce menstrual cycle previously, as a result, they got collected in the ovary and they will remain in the ovary. Now, you have got your periods you can start trying for conception. But I advise you to do it under the supervision of a nearby gynecologist because egg size is important while conception and that you can know by ovulation study. Ovulation study is performed under the supervision of a gynecologist. For gall stones, surgical intervention is required generally.

Revert back after two weeks to a HIV AIDS specialist online -->"},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am a 38-year-old male. I have a family history of myopia and cataract. I had myopia since early childhood. I developed a cataract in both my eyes at the age of 32 and had them operated upon followed by an IOL in both the eyes. Soon after, in the same year, I developed opacification in my left eye and my doctor conducted a YAG laser capsulotomy to have the problem corrected. In this context, I wish to mention that I see several floaters in my left eye. Six years following my cataract surgery and IOL transplantation, I developed a blurry vision and a bubble in my right eye and my doctor diagnosed opacification in my right eye and conducted a YAG laser capsulotomy. Following the capsulotomy, my vision improved but the bubble is still there and it is causing a scattering of light vision in my right eye, more prominent when I am tilting my head towards the right. My doctor says that the anatomical capsule holding on to the IOL in my right eye has weakened over the years and is causing the IOL to move inside my eye. This movement of the lens, coupled with the formation of the bubble is causing the scattering of light vision in my right eye. The doctor said that the bubble should disappear within or around six weeks of the capsulotomy. He also said that if the IOL gets dislodged or its movement causes too much of discomfort, then the solution would be to have the lens removed and replaced with an IOL with its own capacity to hold on to its position without depending on the anatomical capsule to hold it in its place. My questions are:\\tWhat is the reason for the appearance of the bubble in my right eye? As the doctor said, will it disappear within or around six weeks of the capsulotomy? Will I have a better vision if I go for a replacement of the IOL since it is moving? Is there a way to reduce floaters in the eye and to treat macular degeneration of the eye?","Doctor":"Hello,  Welcome to icliniq.com. What is the exact meaning when you use this word \\"bubble\\"? After capsulotomy, capsular fragments start floating in vitreous leading to floaters. This sensation usually decreases with time and slowly over time the brain starts avoiding these images and the patient become comfortable after six to eight weeks after capsulotomy. The decision of replacing the present lens with the scleral fixated lens is entirely dependent on your ophthalmologist. If the lens is in the pupillary axis, I would not suggest replacing it. If it is dislocated so that the pupil is without lens or lens is tilted a lot, in these conditions I would opt for replacing the present lens. There is no treatment for floaters. Just try to ignore them. You did not give any history regarding macular degeneration, but again there is no treatment for macular degeneration. I need to see your reports. In case, if there is CNVM (choroidal neovascular membrane) at the macula, then you may need an intravitreal injection.

I became ill the next day with vomiting, weakness, fatigue, muscle aches, chills. It was not until 10 days, later that I heard about the recall and made a connection. My gynecologist is concerned, but has no experience with listeria so she is not confident about how to proceed. She had a sonogram to verify the baby is fine at this point. She also ordered a blood culture. However, I have read that blood culture is not necessarily accurate. While my symptoms are gone, I fear that it can stay in my system for 70 days and could affect the baby at any point during that time without me knowing.

Therefore, she does not want to proceed unless the blood culture is positive. Is there anything further I can do as a precaution?","Doctor":"Hello. Well contracting symptoms, immediately the next day following contaminated food is extremely rare. The incubation period to get symptoms of illness following the ingestion of food is 48 hours to 70 hours. Listeriosis is a self-limiting illness unless the patient is at high risk as in immunocompromised persons as it is an opportunistic infection. Pregnancy particularly third trimester is definitely a risk, but other more common causes like viral illness and other causes are to be ruled out. As in your case, your illness vanished without any intervention, it would have been a viral illness or a self-limiting illness. The only recommended investigation to rule out listeriosis is culture with enrichment media. Other serological tests are there but are unreliable. The good thing here is that you and your baby are completely fine. Your concern is apt but you need to await for the result as treating without confirmation a pregnant lady who is not symptomatic is of no use. Do not eat frozen foods, hot dogs and all these stuffs. Stay positive and do let me know the results."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am a 19 years old male. I have an abscess on my balls, it is reddish and feels pain, but not much.

I had got this from a doctor, for the fungal infection, the doctor may suggest Fluconazole 150 mg to be taken twice in one week, for three weeks. Apply Onabet cream over it twice daily. Do not apply any other cream. For the abscess, you need a course of antibiotics Amoxicillin and Clavulanic acid (Augmentin) 625 mg thrice daily for five days.","Doctor":"Hello. I looked through the photographs. (attachment removed to protect patient identity). There is a small pustule in the scrotum and you seem to have a fungal infection in the groin. For the fungal infection take a tablet of Fluconazole 150 mg once followed by the same tablet one week later. Also, wash the area with normal temperature clean water twice daily, and apply Onabet (Sertaconazole Nitrate) or Zimig (Terbinafine Hydrochloride) cream. You may use a mild soap once daily or once every two days. Nextly, for the pustule, apply Mupirocin or Betadine ointment on the pustule after washing it clean and take tablet Augmentin (Amoxycillin and Clavulanic acid) 625 mg tablet twice daily for five days. The infection will subside. I would suggest you take the above medications as described and then review with me after one week. You should be better by then. Also, another suggestion is that you may attend hygiene in that area, especially in the sultry hot climate that provides perfect conditions for bacteria and fungi to grow in the groin area. You could trim the hairs carefully using scissors every week and keep them to a manageable length. Or after trimming you may remove those closely using a body groomer. This will have some benefits like better aeration, easier application of creams and ointments, lesser holding onto sweat and consequently lesser chances of fungal and bacterial infection.

I had an upper endoscopy, colonoscopy, left kidney CT scan, gallbladder ultrasound, blood work, and HIDA scan and found nothing, but I have a torturous colon. The pain gets pretty bad and I am worried it is something more serious, but I try reassuring myself that it is not since I have had so many tests. What could this be?! Should I be worrying so much?","Doctor":"Hello. From your history, it seems to be an inflammation of one or more of the cartilages that connect the ribs to the breastbone. It is a condition called Tietze syndrome (when there is a swelling over the painful area) or costochondritis (no swelling, only pain). This condition has no known cause although many theories do exist (none proved). The main features are local pain, with or without swelling. It generally resolves in 12 weeks. However, it would be best if you can get a chest x-ray and an ECG (electrocardiogram) to rule out a rib fracture and a heart condition (angina) respectively. Treatment:-  1. Take tablet Asprin 325 mg SOS (whenever you feel pain) up to a maximum of eight tablets a day. 2. Tablet Ranitidine 75 mg once a day. Whenever you take aspirin it reduces the stomach irritation caused by aspirin. 3. Locally apply Diclofenac gel thrice daily. Chest x-ray PA (posteroanterior) view, ECG (electrocardiogram). Angina, rib fracture. Tietze syndrome, costochondritis. Oral analgesics for two weeks, hot fomentation, local application of the analgesic gel. Avoid weight-bearing over shoulders or chest, chest exercises or external impact over the area involved. Review with a doctor after your ECG and chest x-ray is done."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, My gynecologist removed most of a polyp in her office with a local anesthetic and NSAID shot. However bits are still attached to the uterine wall because she was afraid of puncturing wall if I move. I had a colonoscopy with Propofol and had only had a bit of dizziness when I stood up, but it gone within a minute or two (I actually could have driven myself home). I had wanted to do without anesthetic, but the doctor said there was no way to get a local that far up. However, my gynecologist is afraid I could still move under Propofol and wants a general anesthetic. I only get to talk to an anesthesiologist at the hospital where once I schedule a surgery so I want to find out about perhaps using an epidural or spinal anesthetic.

I am currently taking Levothyroxine sodium 50 mcg and some vitamin supplements.","Doctor":"Hello. Regarding your query, your surgery can be done under spinal or epidural anesthesia. It is a much safer option than general anesthesia. You will be pain-free for hours after surgery. You will be absolutely awake during surgery and will not be able to move your legs even a bit. The only thing is you will not be discharged on the same day of surgery which is not a big issue. So in my opinion, unless spinal anesthesia is contraindicated for you, ask your anesthetist if spinal anesthesia is feasible. Do not worry everything will be fine."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I am currently taking Venlafaxine and Mirtazapine together. There are discussions around adding Wellbutrin as well, I just wanted to get someone else thoughts on that combination of three drugs. Is it safe? Would it be effective? And is it a known combination of drugs which has been specificied before?","Doctor":"Hello. Combination antidepressant therapy works better if first line monotherapy has not been effective. I note that you are diagnosed with depression, anxiety and PTSD which can sometimes be challenging but gets better with the right treatment regimen. Different combination or augmentation strategies are used for better response. Usually, it will involves combining different types of antidepressants.  Venlafaxine (SNRI type) and Mirtazapine (NaSSA type) is a known combination deemed to be safe and used therapeutically. Adding Wellbutrin (Bupropion) is not used routinely but the rationale is understandable. Bupropion is a NDRI (norepinephrine-dopamine reuptake inhibitor) type atypical antidepressant. Bupropion is also used in smoking cessation. In your case, Is Bupropion used as an additional augmentation drug or to counteract any side effect like sexual dysfunction? Combination of antidepressants can lead to relatively more side-effects including serotonin syndrome. Decision to combine drugs is made by carefully weighing up the benefits and risks involved. If benefits outweigh the possible risks, it is worthwhile trying the combination cautiously. Risk will be more if you have any pre-existing health problems like hypertension, seizures, etc. Complex decision like this are usually made by psychiatrists in specialist/tertiary medical centres. Whenever combination antidepressants are used, the prescribing consultant and treating team will have to follow up closely, monitoring the dose response and look out for any treatment emergent side effects. Usually there will be regular follow up reviews especially during the initial period. Also always inform or remind if you visit any other doctor about being on combination antidepressants if you are prescribed any other medication (like certain antibiotics) to avoid possible drug interactions. Finally, I believe you are also receiving psychotherapy in addition to medication. In many instances, psychotherapy acts as a good augmentation strategy to manage depression and anxiety disorders."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, Two years back, I had fever and headache.

Can I use half cup milk for tea?","Doctor":"Hi, Am glad to hear you did not stop breast-feeding and that the baby’s weight gain is good. Babies of 3 months may pass stools after every feed-which means if you feed 10 times, they may pass stools 10 times. So that is not a thing to get worried. Regarding the colour of the stools, green-yellow-golden-brown are all normal shades of stools. So you don’t have to worry about green colour. Please remember one more important thing - if the baby is not having any problems/symptoms, then, don’t get any tests done. Because even in a completely normal person there can be a few parameters outside the normal range. We cannot keep chasing the lab report completely forgetting the baby’s condition. If you get a routine health check done during your visit to your pediatrician for vaccination it is sufficient (That is, if the baby is not having any problems/symptoms). Any change in the mother’s diet changes the composition of the breast milk to a small degree, which then is reflected on the child’s routine. You may start taking milk with tea, initially small amounts and gradually increase. The baby’s bowel movement pattern might change but that doesn’t mean it is not good for baby’s health. But don’t start to feed cow’s milk/pateurised milk to the baby yet. Let the baby be atleast 6-7 months for that.

We had sex for the second time and now I guess that I might have ejaculated and so she took one more i-pill. So, in total she had two i-pills in a time gap of two hours. Now she did miss her periods. Is there any chance that she is pregnant?","Doctor":"Hi. If she has taken the i-pill within 24 hours of the intercourse and in her case twice within a gap of two hours then she has doubled the concentration of progesterone. Usually, a withdrawal bleed is seen within next five to seven days from the day of i-pill intake. As she has taken two it may be delayed by a few days, but chance of pregnancy is minimal. If seven day period since the intercourse have been crossed then you may do a serum beta hCG test to rule out pregnancy for confirmation and to settle anxiety. If the test is negative then she is surely not pregnant and then she can wait for her withdrawal bleed to resume naturally without fear, though the chances are minimal. If seven days have not been completed then only option at present is to wait for completion of days and see if the menses resume. Once resumed, pregnancy is ruled out.

I was tested for strep, and the rapid strep test was negative. The white patches looked like they started to go away, but now they are getting bigger again. Please help.","Doctor":"Hi. By looking at the history and symptoms, a few things come to my list of differential diagnosis. Before that, I would like to know a few things like whether it is associated with difficulty in swallowing, headache, neck stiffness, etc. As you mentioned you have already taken antibiotics, the streptococcal cause is less likely but cannot be ruled out completely even though titers are nil. It could be acute on chronic tonsillitis as you also have fever, throat discomfort and body ache. It can be a fungal infection as well especially if your asthmatic and on steroid inhalers. It could be infectious mononucleosis, a kind of viral infection associated with all your symptoms. The possibility is high if there are accompanying swellings in the neck. It usually spreads by kissing. The general mode of management for this would be to gargle salt water at least four to five times daily and drink cold fluids or have ice creams to ease throat pain. Avoid irritating, spicy foods and smoking if you are a smoker. You can take a combination of Ibuprofen and Paracetamol (Combiflam) thrice daily for five days along with antibiotics. For me, it looks more like chronic tonsillitis. The appropriate antibiotic would be Amoxicillin 500 mg thrice daily for five days. You can also take Rabeprazole 20 mg once daily for seven days in case you feel stomach discomfort because of these medications. If frequent recurrences of tonsillitis are happening, then it is better to go for surgical removal of tonsils. Your physician will help you with suitable antibiotics after ascertaining the diagnosis.

My dentist is closed today and I cannot find an emergency number for them. So, I looked up remedies online.

So, I did not think it would be temperature and maybe it is the toothpaste. My second question is, is it a problem that the temporary now has a piece missing from it?

I took Paracetamol 500 mg, Cremagel ointment, and Lignocaine gel. How to heal the anal fissure?","Doctor":"Hello. An anal fissure can be a very troublesome problem. In my practice I suggest the following measures. Do sitz bath daily three times. Cremagel (Diltiazem 2%) should be applied in the orifice half an hour before passing the stool. Take two teaspoons of lactulose solution followed by two glasses of water during bed time. Increased uptake of green leafy vegetables, fibrous vegetables, and fruits. Quit smoking, and drinks if you do. Do cardio exercises regularly. If followed properly the fissure can heal. This region has peculiar anatomy. The fissure does not heal that easily, because the anal sphincter is tight which prevents the return of venous blood. When you do sitz bath with warm water and apply Diltiazem ointment the sphincter relaxes helping the blood to flow and go back. Thus the vascularity helps to remove inflammatory products and heal the wound. Increasing the fiber content of food helps in the formation of soft stools which do not cause the tear in mucosa while passing stools. The injury initially occurs due to constipated hard stools. Lactulose increases water entry into the large intestines and helps to form soft stools. I hope this helps."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor,I am just wondering what is abutting and abutment of the nerve root means in a back issue. Please explain.

Normal bilirubin, as well as, normal ALT (alanine aminotransferase), and AST (aspartate aminotransferase), do not warranty that a person cannot have hepatitis B and C infection. A person infected with hepatitis B and C can have normal liver function tests. In a normal course, HbsAg (surface antigen) comes positive within four weeks of infection and Anti HCV (hepatitis C virus) antibody may take up to six weeks to three months to show its positivity. In general, if a person is found negative after months of exposure we consider it conclusive. In cases where there is a high risk or the diagnosis has to be early we need to get the PCR (polymerase chain reaction) test done for both hepatitis B and C. For hepatitis B we do HBV DNA and for Hepatitis C we do HCV RNA analysis. I hope this helps."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am a 36-year-old male. I am having an issue in my groin area. My symptoms are itching, rashes, and burning sensation on inner thighs. I used Itch guard. Please suggest.","Doctor":"Hello, Welcome to iclinq.com. I have read your query. In my opinion, you are suffering from Tinea cruris, which is a fungal infection of the skin. I advise you to keep the area dry because moisture can aggravate the fungal infection. You can apply Luliconazole cream twice daily on the lesion, and also on the normal skin of around 2 cm around the lesion for three weeks. After applying the cream, you should apply Clotrimazole dusting powder for three weeks. This powder helps in absorbing the moisture and reducing the friction of the area. You also take tablet Levocetirizine 5 mg one tablet after dinner for ten days. This is for the management of itching. You can continue it beyond ten days if you have severe itching. I hope this helps. Fungal infection Tinea cruris. Topical antifungal cream and dusting powder along with oral antihistamines. Please avoid tight fitting clothes. Avoid applying over the counter creams. These creams may contain steroid which can damage the skin. Also, completely dry the inner wear before wearing. Follow up after three weeks."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, My upper right one tooth (front tooth) is painful to touch from the front. It is sturdy and does not move at all. It also is not painful to push from the inside out. It does not hurt to bite down at all. It simply hurts to tap the front of the tooth. Any ideas on what this could be?","Doctor":"Hi. Pain on tapping have two differential diagnosis. It could be a sensitive tooth. Enamel of tooth is weak that is why it is having greater amount of sensitivity on touch and pressure. If this is the case then veneering is done on the front surface of the tooth and this complain goes away in a week. The other reason could be there is some infection in the underlying tooth. Periapical, periodontal abscess or infections do not need caries or cavities to cause infection. They occur at root and bone part of tooth and usually occur silently. Once they start to aggravate, they cause such symptoms of pain on tapping only. Get X-ray done of the tooth in question, send me its picture and clinical picture of tooth also. If this is the case then root canal treatment is recommended. Give me its followup once you get radiograph done. Stay happy and blessed. Take care."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am a 24-year-old male. I am a dental student, and I suffered from clinical depression five years ago. I consulted a psychiatrist, and since then I was on antidepressant Sertraline, antipsychotic Aripiprazole, and Divalproex. Three years after the treatment when the symptoms subsided, the medication was reduced to only Divalproex, but due to some stress, Aripiprazole was started again. Then after some time again due to stress I lost my confidence and started feeling social phobia so Escitalopram was started. The reason I think behind this depression is my academic failure and bullying I suffered during my childhood. I feel normal on taking medications. But my query is that how long I have to take these medicines? Will it terminate and what can I do other than medications to overcome this situation?","Doctor":"Hello. It is good to know that you are able to function well at present and medication has been helpful. I note that you are currently on Escitalopram, Aripiprazole, and Divalproex. You have reported suffering from clinical depression, stress, and social phobia. Since you experienced some sort of relapse when Aripiprazole and Sertraline were stopped, it is advisable to continue the current regimen. Check with your psychiatrist about the exact diagnosis as in some types of affective disorder, mood stabilizer may need to be continued for a longer period (duration depends on individual circumstances, nature of depression, associated symptoms like mood instability, thought, and perceptual disturbances, etc.). Patients need to be on medication for at least some years to minimize chances of relapse. You can try CBT (cognitive behavioral therapy) or psychological therapy to help you manage your condition better and prevent relapse. Also, learn stress management techniques. You can try yoga, regular exercise, and develop good social relationships, etc. Have regular follow-ups with your psychiatrist. I hope this helps."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I have multiple small cysts in both ovaries (PCOS).

Now I have been prescribed Pregabalin 50 mg daily but have just recently been giving a few Valium which stopped my twitches in my hands and jaw and I think these would be beneficial to me but I do not know what to say to the neurologist. I do not want him thinking that I am going to abuse them which I will not. But I do not know how to go about trying to explain that they really are helping me.","Doctor":"Hi.  In view of the symptoms you have been suffering with, your diagnosis fits into a case of essential tremor which is the most common movement disorder associated with trembling, there is sometimes shaking of fingers, hands, and head. Particularly, increased with action as during writing, eating, dressing and so on. According to guidelines, Pregabalin and other drugs like Propranolol, Topiramate, Levatiracetam should be tried and they are known to do miracles. Pregabalin started at a dose of 50 mg is increased gradually to 75 and so on upto 600 mg according to the response. Now coming to Valium, yes as you said it is a very good drug but long term use causes increased muscle weakness, fatigue, memory problems, dizziness, ataxia, loss of libido, restlessness, drowsiness and so on. I would advise you to communicate with your physician and try other good medications which also will act similar to Valium."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I thought I got bit by something three days ago. I went to the hospital yesterday morning at 5 and was told it was MRSA. I had MRSA a couple of times in the past 8 years. This is the worse case I ever had. The hospital gave me two antibiotics Cephalexin 500 mg 4 times a day and Bactim DS tablets two times a day. It has been 22 hours on antibiotics. It is getting worse and I started running a fever of 100.4 tonight. The pain is increasing and I can barely walk because of the pain. I called the on call doctor and he was concerned that I was running a fever but said there is nothing we can do now. Make an appointment tomorrow and we will have to come up with a new plan to treat this. I cannot get in till tomorrow afternoon. It started with a bit looking like bump. Now it has spread out to be as round as a baseball or a little bigger. Earlier it had a black dot in the middle and now it is turning a black color around the black dot. They gave me no cream to put on it, no steroids to help with the inflammation. Just two antibiotics. I was in and out of the emergency room yesterday within 15 minutes. What should I do?","Doctor":"Hi,  Welcome to icliniq.com.  I have read your query and seen the attached pictures and can well understand your concern (attachment removed to protect patient identity). As you have developed fever, it is advisable to get a blood culture sensitivity test done. Though the report will come in 48 hours, it will help in a better choice of antibiotics.   Though antibiotics can be changed to Linezolid or Vancomycin, but it is best that it should be done with the consultation of your examining doctor. Till that time you can continue with the same antibiotics you are already on. Take tablet Paracetamol 650 mg twice a day. A combination of Aceclofenac and Seratiopeptidase twice a day will help in decreasing pain and swelling associated with the disease. Apply Mupirocin cream (T-bact) over the lesion twice a day.

Is this true and what test can I do to find out?","Doctor":"Hello. Flat feet are not always symptomatic and neither do they need treatment as a rule. Issues such as pain, callosities, progression of dropped arch, etc., are reasons for seeking treatment. I am not getting enought information from your description to take this further. People with hypermobility are more likely to have flat feet and some may develop painful flat foot too. You may need correction through boots that will support the ankle as well as arch supports and a deep heel cup to control the heel valgus. First of all, you need a full assesment as the exact cause of your flat feet, you will need physiotherapy to strengthen the intrinsic muscles, attentions to the tibialis posterior as well as the tendoachilles is needed. Shoe inserts or custom shoes may be needed. You will need X-rays to assess the deformity and this may act as a base line to assess further progression. If you need further info then please send a detailed description and perhaps a clinical note from your podiatrist or physiotherapist A clinical picture of your feet while standing picture taken from the sides and back will help more."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I have had persistent nausea for roughly 15 months now which from memory started on a holiday where I had drank coffee and ended up with anxiety symptoms. I have had heaps of testing done and an endoscopy actually found eosinophilic esophagitis (which is basically esophagitis caused from an allergy). I have been treated with a PPI which appears to not be helping and have also been prescribed Lovan (Prozac). I am currently one week into taking these tablets and have recently cut out gluten and dairy to see if the allergy was from these foods. The doctor did a RAST test which showed a class 0 allergy to all main food groups including wheat and milk so I have just started eating them again. I have just drank my first coffee in about a week and had severe panic symptoms and tight throat which I have never experienced before. I would just like to know if a caffeine allergy is likely and could it be the cause of all these problems? I used to drink coffee fairly regularly and never quite felt great off it but it never seemed to make the nausea that much worse.","Doctor":"Hello. Thanks for writing your query to me.  After going through your history, it is very clear that what you described are totally two different issues. One thing is eosinophilic oesophagitis and second is caffeine sensitivity. I used the word sensitivity for caffeine because it is different from caffeine allergy. What you are suffering from now may be caffeine hypersensitivity as there are no other allergic symptoms associated with panic attacks. Even if you were having coffee before, you may become hypersensitive to coffee now.  The treatment of it is to avoid coffee at all and see the difference. Some oral Steroid spray like Flovent is also advised by gastroenterologists to prevent side effects of long term oral steroids. It is very difficult to differentiate between caffeine sensitivity and allergy based on clinical examination. For that you need to do skin prick test.  Finally avoidance is the best strategy for treating caffeine sensitivity. I hope the concept is clear to you now."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, My 8-year-old daughter went out of town.

As you correctly said after returning, your kids are suffering from reactions to excess chlorine in swimming pool water. Usually it manifests as difficulty in breathing, hyperventilation and irritation in the upper airways. Usually, it is self-limiting but if it is not resolving you may need medical help. You can try following steps at home and if no relief go to the hospital. Further decontamination and adequate hydration is must. You can give milk or fruit juices to your kids.

The only symptom I had was bleeding in between my period that month, so I decided to go get checked out. I was prescribed two Azithromycin pills to take that day, and was told that everything would clear up in two weeks. After taking the pills I was fine, no spotting or anything, followed all of the instructions (no sex, drinking, etc.). Then, last week I had protected intercourse for the first time since all of this happened, woke up the next morning and I had started to bleed again. I immediately went back to the doctor and he said that chlamydia can survive in your stomach and sometimes Azithromycin does not get it. So he prescribed me Doxycycline twice a day for two weeks.

I am just very worried and really want all of this to be over with.","Doctor":"Hi. Your bleeding is unlikely be solely due to chlamydia infection. There is a possibility of cervical erosion or polyp which needs to be diagnosed by speculum examination and if needed, by ultrasound. If the pathology is found, needs to be treated differently. Regarding treatment of chlamydia infection, your sexual partner also needs to be tested and get treated to prevent reinfection. Regarding your abdominal pain, it is likely to be due to gastritis induced by Doxycycline. You can take antacids for its relief."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, My baby boy was born three weeks and one day earlier, with a weight of 5 lbs 9 oz. We live with my husband's mother, and she is helping us take care of our son. For the past couple of nights, she is taking our son into her bedroom for him to sleep with her. She has two dogs that are miniature pinscher that can be very mean at times. I cannot sleep those past nights because of our son not being in our bedroom and it has stressed a lot and I cried a lot. This is my only child, but my husband's second. I do not want anything bad happening to him like SIDS or anything like that, especially he is so tiny. As I read online, it said for babies not to sleep with anyone and to sleep in their beds due to them being at risk for SIDS. I am too afraid that our son will roll off the bed and hurt himself very badly, or one of her dogs attacks him. I apologize if I sound like a crazy over reacting mother, but it has got me so worried as being a mother for the first time. If I dare say anything to my mother-in-law about it, she will kick us out in the freezing cold and make sure that we have no place to live. What should I do?","Doctor":"Hello. I understand your problem but it is important to take up this problem as a family collectively involving your husband, mother-in-law, yourself, and if possible your mother too. If I was in your place I would tell the mother-in-law that I wish to stay close to my child as I am unable to sleep without the child in sight out of anxiety and that I want to feed him at night. You can say that since the child is small, the child would require breast feeding every two hourly even at night which is actually very important. That way you can keep the baby with you when the baby is sleeping. And please dogs around the child are strictly not allowed.  Regarding SIDS (sudden infant death syndrome) it can happen to any child. Getting anxious about it will do no good. Instead read about how much you can do to prevent it like keeping the child in the supine position while sleeping, burping the child for 20 minutes post-feeding, etc. Also, keep the child in a separate cot whilst sleeping.

The doctor did not want me to go to a psychiatrist because he might give me medication that would be addictive, and affect my learning skills.

First of all, I am so sorry to hear about your problem. I can imagine how hard it is for you, especially when you have so much to deal with. Although therapy is essential in treating anxiety, medications are a must to control the physical symptoms. You have not mentioned when your exams are, what you can do is mention this to your doctor so they will give you non-sedative medicines. So you will not feel very sleepy, but these medications will definitely help you perform better, and help you to cope up.  About therapy, I would recommend you should continue, and if you do not find the local therapist effective, we can start it online via video consultation. Lastly, please always remember, nothing is more important than your health. Do not ever judge your worth based on your exam scores, you already have so much going on, just do as much you can and do not burnout yourself.

At first, I thought it was a jaw issue because if I opened my mouth too wide my throat and jaw would start hurting like crazy. At one point it got so bad I had to put my face in a pillow and use hot and cold compresses. After seven days of sitting in pain and no improvement, I went to an urgent care facility. They gave me a strep test and I tested positive for strep pharyngitis. I was put on 300 mg of Clindamycin three times a day for 10 days. It is now the eighth day and I am still in pain. The pain did ease up compared to when I first got it, but how long will it take for the tongue soreness and occasional sore throat to stop? Some of my glands are still swollen. This morning I had tongue soreness on the left side of my tongue in the back. Now I am having some tongue soreness on the right side again. It seems like the throat soreness and tongue pain keeps switching sides. What do I do? I did go to my doctor last week and told her that I am still experiencing pain since starting the antibiotics and told her about my tongue soreness. She said sometimes strep can cause tongue soreness. She even retested me for strep to see if the antibiotics were working and I tested negative. She looked at my throat said it looked raw. She also said that the antibiotics will work slowly. Since I am allergic to Amoxicillin and Azithromycin it was my final choice. I am still having throat issues. I can eat and drink no problem, but the medicines also cause me to have dry mouth. The tongue tenderness at the sides and back worrying me the most.","Doctor":"Hello. I looked into the photographs you have sent. (attachment removed to protect patient identity).  Correlating it with your complaint and history I conclude that you have resolving pharyngitis. There is only mild congestion in your throat specially the pillars and soft palate which is a sign of healing of the infection. The antibiotics are working. In order to accentuate the healing and to relieve you of the bumps and associated complaints, you need some supportive treatment as follows. However, the following is a suggestion based on the conversation we had and is not a substitute for actual office consultation. To reduce pain and soreness: take tablet Paracetamol 650 mg twice a day for two days and thereafter once when it pains. To reduce the inflammation and edema take tablet combination of Trypsin, Chymotrypsin, Bromelain, Rutopside taken once or twice a day half an hour before food for two to three days. To reduce small oral ulcers: these usually arise during the course of antibiotics due to vitamin deficiency caused by the antibiotic. Antibiotic destroys the friendly bacteria in the gut that produces a lot of B-complex vitamins. Hence take multivitamin supplements and also probiotics lactobacillus tablets, saccharomyces tablets or powder. To soothe the throat: take warm saline gargles. Mix two teaspoons of salt in 200 ml hot water and gargle the throat thrice a day. To soothe the neck at the region of gland: do hot fomentation of the area to help reduce the pain and soreness due to the gland enlargement. In normal course, these supportive measures help immensely and you will feel just fine within three or four days. However, in the event, if you do not find relief or develop fever or develop any lump in the throat, you need to visit your otolaryngologist for an office consultation."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, My 12-year-old son has been complaining about pain on his front thigh (quadriceps) on both legs since he was 3 years old.

Sometimes he feels clicking on front quadriceps and he feels relieved after clicking. Sometimes he says it is burning and stinging. Sometimes he needs rest to get rid of the pain. Sometimes he cannot walk even for a day and need pain killers. I could say it is always with him. This isssue had affected his running, sports and activities.

Sometimes when I sit on chair one or two drops come out very rarely after I urinate. I did an ultra sound a few months ago, my prostate is normal and it showed signs of mild cystitis, and bladder infection. I also took medicine, but there is no improvement. Can the urine go back into my testis? I do not have a burning sensation and no pain. I have mild testis pain and it keeps itching. Please give me a cure for this.","Doctor":"Hello. I just read your query. First of all, if you should go for a urine culture examination. It will reveal if there is some kind if infection. If the infection is present then you need medication according to it. Sometimes infection too may cause cystitis. You do not need ultrasound right now. Wait for one more month if condition worsens, then go for it. Second thing if some urine stuck into your penis then it does not go back to your testes, so do not worry at all and do not keep on scratching your testes as it would not help you cure your problem. Now to improve your problem you have to take precautionary measures. First of all drink plenty of water. As it will help to flush out the system. At least take 8 to 10 glasses of water per day. Take syrup Neeri two tablespoons with water twice a day for three to four weeks. It will help you in cystitis and control your urge of urinating again and again. Take Gokhshuradi kwath 10 ml with water twice a day for two to three weeks. It will help to clean your bladder and help to remove the infection if any. Take syrup Mentat two tablespoons twice a day with water for three to four weeks. It will help you in calming down your mind and help in preventing the urge of urinating again and again.  Sleep adequately. Sleep for seven to eight hours at least. If you masturbate excessively then stop doing that.

After the delivery, it takes around six weeks for the body physically, hormonally to get back to non-pregnant level. I mean to say that the hormones which were very high during pregnancy will not allow ovulation to occur, that is why you do not get periods during pregnancy. After delivery, if you regularly breastfeed the baby, those hormones do not come back to normal till you stop breastfeeding. Indirectly you do not get pregnant. It is always advised to exclusively breastfeed the baby until four months. A gap between pregnancy will allow you to regain a lot of lost energy and reserves. It is time for this baby to get full care and energy as milk. The next baby will also have good reserves from the mother. But this is not an absolute method of contraception. Many get pregnant even without any periods. But as you had periods it means you are not pregnant. During this period you will need additional contraception like Cu-IUD (copper-T intrauterine devices), or injectable medications, etc., as per your doctors advice. In your case, if you had good bleeding, pregnancy is ruled out."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I have blurry vision in a small section of my right eye, and it keeps moving around. Sometimes, it completely disappears. In addition, I have pain on the inside of my top and bottom eyelids as well as the outer corner of my eye, but I feel the pain only when I blink. This pain is also alternated between those three sections of my eye while I was wearing the contacts, but the pain has settled in my top eyelid now. I also noticed the discharge a couple of minutes ago. These symptoms started this morning upon inserting my cleaned contact lenses. I am currently on Melatonin and Depo-Provera.","Doctor":"Hello. Stop wearing contact lenses until the eye is completely normal without redness. Consult an ophthalmologist nearby to check for eyelids and retina for moving things and weak spots (lattice). The moving thing is a floater. It is uncommon in your age unless you are myopic. There is a jelly-like substance in the eye and as age progresses it starts to liquify and you start seeing floaters. You should go to an ophthalmologist immediately in case if there is an increase in the number of these floaters, or if you are seeing flashes of light. Because these are the signs of retinal detachment. Get your retina checked at least once a year. Right now you have to ignore the floaters and you will get used to it."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I have a super itchy skin rash around my genital (not on my genital) and on hip. It has been there for a few months now. First it was around my genitals and hips but now it is on my hips only. Whenever I used to scratch, dead skin and dry blood comes off. At first I thought it was just a rash and will go away but now it has been a month and it is not going anywhere. It is continuously itchy.","Doctor":"Hi. It seems the rash and itching in the groins and waist area could probably be due to a fungal infection of the skin. This is very common especially in tropical countries and more so in the hot humid summers. To accurately diagnose the same further information like images of the affected area, total duration of the rash, any other areas affected, any discoloration of nails, etc., is needed. If it is indeed a fungal infection the following can be kept in mind: 1. Treatment of fungal infections includes applications which contain Ketoconazole, Sertaconazole, Luliconazole, etc. Oral antifungals like Terbinafine and Itraconazole are often used in combination for better clearance and reducing recurrences. 2. Local hygiene is very important. Taking bath daily, drying the skin folds after bath, keeping soap and towels separate and drying your clothes in sunlight and ironing them before wearing will help to kill the fungal spores. So, I will recommend evaluation by a dermatologist to decide on the treatment. If you have any queries please feel free to reach out. Hope this helps."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am diagnosed with chronic rhinitis by an ENT doctor. I cannot sleep at night and barely eat anymore because I cannot taste or smell anything. My nose is always stuffy. I tried Neti pot, sinus irrigator, herbs, and steam inhalation. I cannot seem to find anything that helps except steroids. I used Carticosteroid nasal spray and Methylprednisalone 4 mg, but those are terrible to keep using. I lost hope. What to do?","Doctor":"Hello.  I understand your problem. It can be a bothersome problem in your case. Chronic rhinitis should be evaluated, and any condition causing it should be addressed specifically. If you could show me the findings of the nasal endoscopy it will be useful for me to make a decisive diagnosis. You may also do nasal odor tests to confirm the loss of sense of smell and let us know the results of the same. Nextly, the use of corticosteroid nasal sprays are not bad at all. They are very helpful in resolving nasal inflammation and accompanying rhinitis. You may use them as per your doctors advice, we also regularly advise patients to use those. As to using oral steroids, you do not use those continuously for a long duration. Also, try taking saline nasal sprays once a while. Drink plenty of water and eat well balanced timely nutritious food. Kindly revert back with the findings of endoscopy and nasal odor tests. Kindly do the following also to rule out allergic rhinitis. 1. Absolute eosinophil count. 2. Serum IgE. With the above, we can make a more decisive diagnosis, and rule out major conditions and institute the specific treatment to help you feel better."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor,I am just wondering what is abutting and abutment of the nerve root means in a back issue.

I understand your worries, but there is nothing much to worry about. It is common to have an event of fainting and dizziness, I see often amongst my patients with RBBB (right bundle branch block). RBBB is due to a slow heart rate that is why he is having dizziness often. You should not worry about going to the ER (emergency room) as his blood pressure and heart rate is normal for now. You should keep monitor of the rates at least every two to three hours. If his symptoms persist with a drop of heart rate below 60 bpm, you should consider taking him to the ER informing them of his present condition.

And the main problem is my power is still increasing. Why is it increasing? Is there any solution to make the power constant? If my power becomes constant, shall I go for Lasik surgery? Can it be done with both the eyes with the power I have? Please kindly give me some suggestions.","Doctor":"Hello. First of all, you need to get an indirect ophthalmoscopy done to rule out areas of weakness in your retina. Cause of your increasing number it can be pathological myopia in which your retina is getting increasingly weak. Now about lasik: your right eye is amblyopic which means your brain has started neglecting images from this eye and is focusing more on images from the left eye so even if lasik is done the best possible correction in the right would be 6/60. But the good news is if there is no contraindication to lasik you can get it done in the left eye and you can have good vision. There are various pre-operative tests before one considers doing lasik, for example. thickness of the cornea, any breaks in retina, etc. If you qualify for all these then you can go for lasik. During lasik there is an induced pressure rise in your eye up to 65 mmHg (our inherent pressure is 20 mmHg), so such pressure causes no problem for normal patients. But as far as you are concerned this can be harmful to you, so before lasik, try to do a laser to your weaker parts of the retina. Visit an experienced lasik surgeon and discuss all the pros and cons."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am a 25-year-old male. I am a soccer player, and I have some wear and tear on my knees and ankles because of it, although I never had a significant injury. About a week and a half ago I injured my knee while playing soccer. My foot was not planted when I injured my knee, so I do not think it is ACL, but it has been a week and a half and my knee is not getting better. Two days after it had happened I could not walk without crutches because it hurts my knee too much, but since then I am able to walk without too much pain, only for shorter distances. I am a college student so after getting home from school my knee is very sore from the walking. I have a very limited range of motion right now as well. I can straighten my knee with some difficulty, but I cannot bend it backward. When bending it backwards, I can get it to about 90 degrees, but at that point, I have to stop because it feels like my knee is going to explode from the pressure. In the few instances where I have caught my foot on something causing my leg to bend back past 90 degrees, there is a pretty intense pain that shoots through my knee. Also, I have some minor visible swelling, but it feels like it is swollen from inside. I am wondering if I should consult a doctor immediately, or if I should wait a few weeks to see if it gets better on its own. Any advice would be greatly appreciated.","Doctor":"Hello. I will recommend that you do see your doctor as the markers of a significant injury are there, immediate pain and swelling, inability to bear weight, persisting swelling, etc. Even if we over-diagnose and nothing came out of the investigation like an MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) then two things will still happen that will help you.  You will be sure that the joint is fine including the ACL (anterior cruciate ligament), MCL (medial collateral ligament), etc., as MCL injury can occur in your described mechanism and you will have the confidence to return to soccer without a hitch. You will then undergo supervised physiotherapy that will help you rehabilitate better. If there is a ligament injury then that is the last thing that may lead you to give up soccer if missed. In the meantime ice the knee, give rest to it, elevate it when resting and put a compression bandage to get rid of the swelling. I suggest taking Diclofenac 75 mg twice a day after meals for a week. I hope this helps."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, My face is getting loose and there are wrinkles. My weight is 55 kg but after my third delivery, this problem is increasing day by day. My body structure is fine but my face is thin from the chin side. I want to get fat on my face, what should I do?","Doctor":"Hello. I read your query. The reason for wrinkles on the face is due to your collagen (elastic tissue which maintains face elasticity) is getting looser, as a result, your skin is becoming loose because collagen is not holding it properly, and sometimes lack of facial fats which might be due to improper diet. The natural remedies will help you a lot in this condition. Try all these regularly and you will soon feel positive results. Start practicing Anulom Vilom regularly. This is a breathing exercise and it will increase your oxygen supply to the body and your skin will become more graceful on regular practice. Start taking healthy and skin-friendly food like fresh fruits and vegetables. Start taking different berries like strawberry, blackberry, etc., as all these will help to make your skin more lustrous. Add other fresh fruits too whatever you like. Take aloe vera gel and massage your face twice daily with it. It will help to tighten your skin. You can also apply fresh fruit's pulp on your face as it is rich with anti oxidants. Start taking one teaspoon of almond oil in milk at night regularly, as it will be extremely beneficial for your skin. You can also apply almond oil at night on your skin, it will also help in curing the problem of wrinkles. Sleep adequately at least for six to eight hours because sleep is very essential for your skin health. If you smoke then quit smoking because smoking also loses collagen. You will find positive results within one month after regularly practicing all these things. In case if you want immediate results then, you can consult a dermatologist or cosmetologist nearby you. They can suggest you artificial cosmetic therapies. After four weeks."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I was on the Depo injection, finished it four months back, then started the pill for 8 days only.

I have not ovulated this month. Could this be due to the Depo or the pill or something else? I am not pregnant as I have done test, it is negative.","Doctor":"Hello.  It is for your information that post prolonged use of Depot injection, the menstruation cycle is likely to be anovulatory for 2-3 cycles after it restarts post stoppage of injection. You had your initiation of bleed last month and had a proper menses 14 days later, but this cycle is likely to be anovulatory in most of the cases. So, even though you may be trying, yet you would not conceive. It would be best if you can start using ovulation kits from the next cycle from day 10 daily to check for LH surge, which would help find the time of ovulation (again whether or not you ovulate as well) and you would be able to have a better control over your actions."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, Kindly go through the MRI report of my sister.

He said that it can close spontaneously just like the VSD, so we have to check it after three months. We needed a second opinion so we consulted another cardiologist who echoed my baby and found out the same results, but he said that it is 6 mm superior secundum, but it will not close on its own cause of its position.

I will advise you to wait till your baby is 6 months old to have him checked again before a decision can be made to operate on him. It is safer operating on older children than infants. If it does not close, later on, scars would not be a problem. Scars will be minimal and be eliminated using cosmetic or plastic procedures.

This sudden painless loss of vision prompts the possibility of central retinal vein occlusion (CRVO).

By a laser, we will have to burn those areas which are causing the problem. We have to inject some anti-VEGF (vascular endothelial growth factor) inside her eye so that swelling comes down. But if blood is too much we have to go for surgery. Consult the retina specialist in your town. For the time being start her on Timolol eye drop twice daily.

Prevention: Change your contact lenses frequently, especially if they are monthly disposable, do not wear them for over a month. Clean them each time before you insert them into your eye. Avoid using colored lenses. You should meet an ophthalmologist if in case you continue having the feeling that there is something in your eyes or your eyes become red and start watering or if you have blurry vision in your eyes.

For nearly ten years, she suffered from bronchiectasis and was treated with Cortisone. Five years back, because of a general illness (insomnia, tremors and loss of appetite) we went to a few specialists such as dietician and homeopathy doctor. After several failures, he prescribed the Levobren that my mother took in the dose of 15 drops per day. My mother took the drug continuously for a year and a half. After six months from beginning, she could not move the fingers of her right hand and this paresis gradually extended to the arm. In addition to this, she spent most of the day sleeping and she was in a state of mental confusion with low emotional and impulse control. After a geriatric hospitalization last year, it was denied that she suffered from Alzheimer's and was recommended a neurological examination. The neurologist, seeing that she was taking the Levobren from three years, was alarmed and suspended it. My mother was hospitalized in the neurology department where she was diagnosed of motor neuron disease. We decided to start a course of physiotherapy which initially seemed to give results, but then the paresis started to extend from the arm to the right leg, while the left part had no problem. Last month, due to a general illness, loss of swallowing reflex and aphonia she could not maintain an upright position and to presumed aspiration pneumonia, she was hospitalized and she died. Taking into account that by specialist examinations made after the first neurological examination no one has ever confirmed the motor neuron disease, and no one knew how to cure her since she was not included in the protocol of no diagnosis.

I took Amoxicillin for one week and the inflammation went down in the gum area. During that time, I had pain in my gum area and that would radiate to my head sometimes. I heard that the headache can be a symptom. Does pericoronitis of upper tooth cause a brain infection? The reason for this question is that I am getting pain in my ears, eyes and sometimes around the head. My doctor said that the prognosis for pericoronitis is very good when the wisdom tooth is taken out. I never heard a story of someone dying from a brain infection from upper tooth pericoronitis. My gum is not inflamed anymore, so I believe that the infection has resolved or under control. However, should I worry about pericoronitis? I heard that majority of people who got pericoronitis do not have any problem after the tooth extraction. Also, I popped a pimple on my right temple and it was bleeding a little bit. Can that cause a brain infection? I visited my doctor thrice for this.

You may know that Effexor XR is effective against depression and Strattera is used to manage ADHD. Sometimes both are prescribed together when you have ADHD along with depression. Your psychiatrist is following a safe approach of starting on a low dose of Strattera (Atomoxetine) and gradually titrating up the dose depending on your response and tolerability.

Your ECG is fine (attachment removed to protect patient identity). There are no significant abnormalities seen in ECG (electrocardiogram). Machine generated report mentioned at the top is frequently inaccurate so not to get panic with it. Now in cardiac pain, the pain usually occurs on exertion and relieves with rest. This is very classical of cardiac pain if it persists for a few minutes and does not last round the clock more than 1-2 days. Now if the pain does not have such characteristic then it may either be related to cervical spondylosis or gastric reflux. If you have any bloating, burping, heartburn, or upper abdominal pain, then it may be related to gastric reflux. Or if this pain increases on neck movements, associated with tingling, numbness sensation in arms then it may be related to cervical pain. However, considering the risk factors like DM (diabetes mellitus), HTN (hypertension), it is better to rule out the possibility of cardiac pain. So you should undergo echo and if normal then treadmill test."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I have swelling in the neck and tested in the laboratory about three years ago.

I am 17 now and my neck is still swelling, I do not feel any symptoms as of now. The last doctor who checked my neck says it is a non-toxic thyroid problem (but they did not tell what my illness is, because it is just our school medical. better to consult a doctor). Is there any recommendations to prevent my neck from swelling? What are the foods and activities to control the swelling? Is there any thyroid home test I should try to identify how is my thyroid? I will consult a doctor if the situation is totally fine.","Doctor":"Hi. In most cases, when there is a swelling associated with the thyroid, the swelling moves when you swallow and can be seen when you turn your neck backward and swallow. The surest test to detect a thyroid swelling is by doing an ultrasound to assess minor details, size, blood supply, and other aspects which we need to know before we treat you. Secondly, you need to get a thyroid function test wherein we assess the level of the thyroid hormones in your body. Thirdly, we also do a fine needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) to find out what was the cause of the swelling to occur in the thyroid. Here we insert a needle in your thyroid gland in areas of interest and then observe these cells under the microscope. For patients having thyroid problems (hypothyroid to be specific), we usually avoid foods belonging to the brassica family such as kale, rape, cabbage, cauliflower, and broccoli. These are known to block the synthesis of the thyroid hormones leading to its deficiency and thyroid enlargement. Seafood, bread, and milk are rich sources of iodine. Also, understand that a hyperfunctioning thyroid also can cause a thyroid swelling and the tests mentioned above are basic and have to be done to evaluate any patient with a thyroid problem. So in a nutshell, the doctor who deals with thyroid problems will definitely get these investigations to manage the problem further.

I will provide you with as many details as possible so that maybe you could provide some answers on the cause and cure. For 15 years, I have lived in a very dry region, so I have commonly had dry skin, but that is to be expected here. 17 months ago, I returned from a sailing trip to a case of red itchy bumps. Multiple doctors and dermatologists ran tests and determined it was spongiotic dermatitis. I have tried multiple topical steroids as well as oral steroids, not to mention countless over-the-counter treatments, but I had no relief. However, a 21 days prescription of oral steroids has come the closest to getting rid of it but never has completely cured it and it comes back right away. This has been used a couple of times, but it comes right back. Just over a month ago, I went to a naturopathic doctor to see if they could provide answers. I had done an IgE test, but nothing was found. An IgG test showed that my body was reacting to dairy, almonds, and gluten. I went on a three-week elimination diet, along with a multitude of supplements which seemed to help, but it never went away. That time frame coincided with a warmer climate, but at the beginning of a snowstorm, there was a flare up. I am still trying this method, but it is difficult to live a normal life without any of these foods, but since the constant itching continues, I am not really sure if the diet or weather was responsible for the temporary relief. What might be the cause of dermatitis and how to get rid of it?

You have tried to rule out maximum exogenous causes, but as you did not get any relief, there might be some endogenous factor causing you the trouble. Some examples of endogenous dermatitis are atopic dermatitis, autosensitization dermatitis, dermatitis herpetiformis, prurigo nodularis, seborrhoeic dermatitis, etc. It can be confirmed by skin biopsy, spongiotic dermatitis is a broader term, you must get repeat biopsy and rule out the cause and get treatment accordingly.

(Note : My father has schizophrenia who is under medication for nearly 25 to 30 years). The tablets prescribed by the doctor were Mirtaz 15 and Sulpitac 50. During this period he had an increased appetite and was obese. He was sleeping a lot and was hearing voices (which he told only after changing the doctor and after having the new medicines). One year back he was prescribed with tablets Sulpitac 50, Arip 10. He was fine with these tablets as he was not hearing any voices (during his junior college). The doctor also said that sulpitac is a drug to be avoided since there are chances for cardiac problems in future. But as his exams were nearing (my observation), he had sleepless nights because of which he was always resisting to go to school and started to hear voices again. So each time we consulted the doctor, he increased the dosage. And these are the tablets that he was taking during his exams --> Sulpitac 200, Arpizol 10, TF-Plus, Zolcalm 10 (started with Zolcalm 5) and Flocetam 400(morning). After 3 or 4 exams got over, he again started to have sleepless nights inspite of taking Zolcalm 10. When we visited the doctor mid-way during the exams, the doctor said he had prescribed the maximum dosage beyond which he cannot increase or do anything. So my brother had to cope up to complete all his exams and when his exams were over he did not have any sleep problems after which Zolcalm 10 was gradually stopped. Now he has joined a professional degree but still he takes Sulpitac 200, Arpizol 10, TF-Plus and he is in the midway of his first semester. He has started to have sleepless nights now and then. After consulting with the doctor, we have started to give him half tablet of Zolcalm 10 if he continuously has 2 or 3 sleepless nights. What should be done as the boy is suffering to cope up with his studies? He says that he lies awake during nights and his body gets too tired to move.He also said if my father or mother calls or speaks to him (assuming him to be awake), he gets irritated as he feels too tired to respond. My parents and I are worried about the situation and also about the dosage of Sulpitac which has not been reduced till date. Please help us with this situation.","Doctor":"Hi, Thanks for posting your query at icliniq. After going through the detailed history of your brother, it seems that he is suffering from schizophrenia and he responds fairly to Sulpitac. It is also obvious that he had acute exacerbation of his illness after going through some sort of stressor (example:exam). Before I suggest you anything, I would like to know certain things: In my experience, I would say Sulpitac is not the first choice antipsychotic, as better drugs are available when compared to sulphitac and that too at half the price. So changing drug could be a viable option in your brother's case if not done previously. About 200 mg is all right. It is as safer as other antipsychotic drugs, so I think you need not worry about this. To take care of any adverse effects, please follow the instructions of your psychiatrist. Regarding his repeated problem about sleep when exam approaches, I advise you to engage him in regular studies as it will reduce the burden of so called exams. You can also ensure better sleep hygiene for him as this will also help him in the long run.

Fourth generation p24 anti-HIV (human immunodeficiency virus) antibody is conclusive after a window of two to three weeks. So a negative result at 28 days is reliable.  A positive IgG (immunoglobulin G) for HSV (herpes simplex virus) 1 and 2 means you have an old infection with herpes 1 or 2. HSV type 2 commonly causes genital herpes and HSV type 1 causes orolabial herpes. There is a risk that you may pass on the infection to your sexual partner. CMV (Cytomegalovirus) positivity is quite common in general population. It is a common viral infection and does not cause any issues in immune competent healthy individuals.

It is not severe, but more of an annoyance with some referred ear pain. This week, I had a family member, who is a nurse, look at my throat to see if it was red or irritated. She noted I had quite a bit of post-nasal drip, but she could see no other issues. I had my tonsils removed as a kid, so they definitely are not the issue. I was thinking this might be caused by allergies, the trees and plants around are starting to bloom. I started taking some Claritin on top of painkillers, earlier this week. I also have been gargling with salt water. Those things seemed to help for a day or two, and the issue seemed to go away.Fast forward to last night, I woke up in the middle of the night with a burning pain in my stomach. This morning the burning pain keeps coming and going, and I can feel a lot of mucus dripping down the back of my throat. Is a burning stomach usually something that can be linked to post-nasal drip? I have never had an issue with acid reflux, so I do not think it is that. Also, the burning sensation is limited only to my lower abdomen.I typically do not have issues with severe allergies, so I am wondering if this could be caused by a virus? To be honest, I do not have a lot of confidence in my local doctor's office, and they tend to order a bunch of tests then overcharge for them. So I am wondering if I can get away with not seeing a doctor. I have ordered an air purifier for my room, and I am taking the allergy medicines religiously. Is there something else I can take or use to alleviate these symptoms? Or should I suck it up and see a doctor? I will also add that with these symptoms, I have had little to no nasal congestion or coughing. Thanks.","Doctor":"Hello. You seem to be having some mild inflammation of the sinuses and nasal cavities. The same instead of causing headache or nose block is causing post-nasal drip which occasionally flares up as a sore throat. Let me suggest some medicines that I would do in my practice. In case you do not find any improvement, you can show your local doctor. I would suggest you take a mucolytic medicine that will help lighten the mucus and remove it from sinuses. We have N-Acetylcysteine and Ambroxol in tablet forms. N-Acetyl cysteine comes in a dispersible form also. Ambroxol 30 mg or N-Acetyl cysteine 600 mg, twice daily. You may or may not take an antiallergic medicine. To avoid acid reflux, I would suggest you take Pantoprazole 40 mg twice daily. Acid reflux which can occur in the pharynx causes a sore throat as well. Do revert to me if you need any further support. Hope you feel better soon.

Later she rubbed her vagina across my penis. I moved away but it is completely possible that the end of my penis touched her vaginal lips or opening. She seemed wet. This happened twice, maybe three times, for very pretty short moments before she understood it I did not like it. This was the only exposure, no intercourse, oral or vaginal. I have been a little stressed, even though I believe the risk is low. It has been about 62 hours since the experience and I have very minor symptoms. They could be just in my head. I have noticed over the last 24 hours a very mild sensation at the end of my penis when I pee. Once the flow gets going I do not really notice. It was not present at all in the morning when I woke up. In the last 12 hours I have a mild discomfort in my left testicle, but it comes and goes. I have had just a little trouble with the food here and today had some gut pain. So, the testicle may be just some discomfort from that or stress. It does not feel swollen, but I am not usually paying so much attention to my body. My questions are: What am I at risk for and how likely? Do you have any concern over my symptoms? My wife will visit in less than two weeks. Is there anything I can do to be proactive in that time? Thank you for reading and in advance for your help. Any extra detail you can provide to your thought process would be greatly appreciated.","Doctor":"Hi.

But I am not sure how severe my case is. Do I need medication, or do I just have to monitor my condition?","Doctor":"Hello. I have seen your reports. (attachment removed to protect patient identity).  As I can see from the reports, you are positive for Hepatitis B. The indication for the treatment as per American guidelines is dependent on liver function test and the presence or absence of cirrhosis. So you will need further testing in the form of a liver function test, a thorough clinical examination and an ultrasound of the liver to ascertain whether you will need a treatment or just follow up.

I feel like the eyelid of the eye that does not open as wide might be swollen and there is also an angel's kiss on that eyelid. It also has an extra crease on the outside of the eyelid. Is that ptosis or something else? It does not cover his pupil and does not seem to affect his vision.","Doctor":"Hello. I have seen the photos. (attachment removed to protect patient identity).  From the photos, I can see a few variations from the normal anatomy in both upper lids. There is an extra fold of skin over the upper lid of the right eye, this is called epiblepharon in medical terminology. Now coming to your question of ptosis in the left eye, although there is a little bit of upper lid drooping in the left eye compared to the right, it would be hard to say that it is due to congenital ptosis. My advice to you is Regarding the left eye, wait and watch for another year. Congenital ptosis does require surgery to correct it, but the ideal time to operate would be when the patient is 3-4 years old. This is because we can get more accurate measurements for the surgery then, and the child will also be able to tolerate the procedure. Also, the upper eyelid dropping could be because of the haemangioma or the angel's kiss, which eventually would resolve on its own and the drooping may come down with it. Regarding the right eye, the epiblepharon although harmless on its own, sometimes may cause the inward turning of the eyelids. This may cause the eyelashes to rub against the black portion of his eye (cornea). This needs to be kept in your mind, in case he complains of something irritating his right eye. Kindly visit your doctor when this happens. The treatment for this cause is also surgical. I hope this helps. Observation."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I had blood in my stool.

Depression is comorbid most of the time with OCD (occlusive compulsive disorder) because it is a very frustrating condition when you do not have control over your thoughts. If you control your thoughts and control yourself to engage in it, then it is a very good indication. Now start to engage in other activities, physical exercise and a job as you wanted. Do not get hopeless, and remember one thing that God helps those, who help themselves. You can start with Clomipramine 25 mg and build up as guided.

Her PP sugar level is 149 mg/dL. Can you suggest how to control it? How early baby can be delivered?","Doctor":"Hello. A single reading of postprandial sugar of 149 mg/dL should not be a reason to worry unless your wife has a family history of diabetes or diabetes in the previous pregnancy. She can do one oral GTT (glucose tolerance test). It is a sugar test done in fasting and every hour after giving glucose orally. If that is fine and if there are no other symptoms of diabetes like increased thirst, frequent urination, or frequent infections, then no dietary modification is needed. Normally baby can be safely delivered after 37 completed weeks (four weeks from now). If sugar was already tested more than once and found high, simple dietary modifications like avoiding sugars and reducing carbohydrates in diet should suffice.

Or will the Diflucan alone take care of the external and internal infection?","Doctor":"Hi. I have gone through your history and understand your concern. It could be due to vaginitis caused by a fungal and bacterial infection. You have to take vaginal tablet as well as local application of cream. You can do one thing use plain candid cream and take antifungal and antibiotics for the same. Keep the area dry and clean and drink a lot of warm water and eat lots of vegetables and fruits. Avoid oily and spicy food. Take probiotics for the same."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, My daughter is 2.5 years old. She is diagnosed with ITP last month.

I went to a urologist and got my levels tested, testosterone was 360, and free test 13.5. He said might be good to try Clomifene in order to raise T levels, and I was wondering, would one have to be on it for life?

The doctor basically gave you Clomifene because most likely he suspected that since you have gynaecomastia, therefore, there might be low prolactin levels as well and Clomifene is an anti-estrogen drug, therefore it will help to decrease the gynaecomastia and possibly help you with your erectile dysfunction. There is no harm in taking it for a few months. Although, it is an indirect treatment but might help and not that it has a bad adverse effect. So no harm in trying. Also, since your testosterone was not that low so I do not think that you would have to take it for long. You can try de-stress techniques instead of exercising to relax your mind mainly to achieve your cure.

Its manifestations include corneal abrasions, which are diagnosed with staining. Other manifestations are inflammation and swelling of your eyelids, conjunctiva and blurred vision. This is a self resolving condition and resolves overtime as long as you do not continue to look at the same light source. The treatment for these manifestations (i.e. corneal abrasions, swelling of the eyelid and conjunctiva) remains the same whether it was due to light exposure or otherwise.  The important factors which may prevent the resolution include: Contact lens wear, please wear glasses until you feel better. Pre-existing dry eye, the treatment remains the same, but the condition persists for a longer time. Secondary infections, may require you to be started on antibiotics and medication which dilate your pupils. Home remedies:  Try blinking your eyes a bit more often. Avoid exposure to the UV (ultra violet) light source. Use over the counter analgesics like Paracetamol 650 mg if pain persists. Kindly visit the optometrist in case if there is pain and redness increase, or your eyelids get stuck in the morning with a sticky discharge or blurring of vision increases. UV light exposure.

Our family friend suggested me to consume Kalarchikai medicine, powdered mixed with pepper and honey to have it for one mandalam (48 days). I have completed nearly 44 days by consuming one small ball of the mixture every morning and before two weeks I got my periods. Then I had checked whether the cysts were dissolved by having an abdomen scan. But still, small multiple follicules have been seen in it with both ovaries enlarged. Kindly suggest me what I can do further. I got married before one and a half years and I am much worried about my pregnancy. I have gallstones as well.","Doctor":"Hello. I just read your query. See Kalarachi Kai choornam is helpful in amenorrhea. As far as small cysts are concerned they are unmatured eggs which failed to induce menstrual cycle previously, as a result, they got collected in the ovary and they will remain in the ovary. Now, you have got your periods you can start trying for conception. But I advise you to do it under the supervision of a nearby gynecologist because egg size is important while conception and that you can know by ovulation study. Ovulation study is performed under the supervision of a gynecologist. For gall stones, surgical intervention is required generally. Medicine is not of much help."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I tried a new skincare range called Gopure and American Company. Half an hour later, I developed redness, burning, itching, and swelling. I have discontinued the use and used ice and cold water to relieve symptoms. After four days, my skin is less painful. The company suggests watering down two of the products. I am reluctant to do so. What would you advise?","Doctor":"Hi. It seems that the new skin range that you tried is not suiting your skin. It is important to know what all products you were using and the ingredients in these preparations. If it was a concentrate which had to be diluted and used then the redness and burning would be because of the irritant dermatitis. This could happen to anyone and the irritation of the skin is due to the very high concentration of ingredients in it. This kind of reaction will not happen if you dilute the preparation as advised by the manufacturer and use the product. Sometimes it can also be due to allergy to some components and this will recur every time you reuse the product. Once the skin is back to normal you can try testing the product by applying a small amount of the diluted product on the skin behind your ear or on the skin of the inner forearm. Observe the area for 24 hours. If you develop any itching, irritation, or redness it may indicate allergy to some ingredients. Further patch testing can then be advised to know the exact allergen. And it will be advisable to avoid the product in that case. I hope this helps."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, During masturbation I just rub the tip of the penis and not the entire penis.

Other symptomatic management like nebulization and antipyretic medications to be given as per the symptoms. To trace blood culture, dengue and leptospira results and act accordingly.

There are a few reasons of her symptoms. It could be due to hormonal imbalance caused by premenopausal stage and fibroid.

Last year I had floaters and flashing and went to a specialist who said all is fine. I went for new glasses and they told me I had an epiretinal membrane. I have an appointment next week with the specialist, but so worried I may need surgery. My husband passed away recently and a few weeks later my mother also passed away. I did the eye graph exam (from internet search and there is no distortion). Is this something I can live with or shall I have the surgery next year? I have no one to help me and may have help next year.","Doctor":"Hello. The epiretinal membrane will decrease you. There is a jelly-like substance in the eye and as age progresses it starts to liquify and you start seeing floaters. You should go to an ophthalmologist immediately in case if there is an increase in the number of these floaters or if you are seeing flashes of light. Because these are the signs of retinal detachment. Get your retina checked at least once a year. Right now you have to ignore the floaters and you will get used to it. The surgery is only necessary if you have difficulty in seeing or retinal detachment or cataract. You can talk to your doctor about it and tell you are not comfortable going for surgery until next year. Next time you attach the reports given by your doctor it will be helpful for me."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am 31 years old.

You have a crunching sound when you place your hand across the chest, this suggests either supraspinatus calcification or acromioclavicular joint problem which are most common. Again here imaging in the form of an x-ray or MRI will be helpful. You will have to continue doing exercises and if your symptoms are better and pain is less then you can start warm-up exercises before getting back to playing.

This was 20 years ago, and I have not worked in this field since. While doing this I never wore a mask, no one in the shop did that, except the painter when he was in the booth. No one online seems to wear a mask when doing these tasks either. I know the dust from this process probably is not fantastic, but I had no short term effects and was just hoping someone in the know can put my anxious mind at rest by confirming that the reason no one wears a mask because the dust is relatively safe as far as long term health conditions go. It seems highly unlikely these were fiberglass based as automotive fillers seem to be plastic-based. I also might have been in the shop when sanding of paint happened or smelt the smell of spray paint after a job but never remember being in close proximity to anything like that.","Doctor":"Hello. There is a health hazard upon exposure of such inhalational dust materials for short term exposure (up to 6 months), it can produce allergic rhinitis, cough, and sputum. On long term exposure, it may produce cough, wheezing, nasal stuffiness, fever, blood in sputum, difficulty in breathing. In your case, the exposure is short term and after that no exposure now. You are away from those exposures. So, if at all the issues were there, that might have been now settled down and you become absolutely normal. Only in long term exposure, lung gets damaged or bad effects continue even after stopping the exposure. So, you are on the safer side. You are normal now. If you wish still to test it, then go for x-ray chest, pulmonary function (breathing) test and differential count in the blood. These will tell still the hazardous effect is there are not.

She is 23 years old. The problem with her is that even though she is a really helpful and benevolent person she hates herself and her existence. She always wants to stay sad so that she does not have to fall to low when a sad event occurs. This causes her to stay isolated at times and stay in the corner of a room for prolonged period of time. But yes normally she does not let other people understand this and acts as if she is not sad. Deep inside she thinks she is a burden and a worthless person and hates herself for not being better. She is sort of a perfectionist. She also feels insecure about almost everything in her life. This condition leads her to develop insomnia, and she drinks a lot of coffee too. She eats hardly once every 24 hours and hates doctors so never vistis them. I am seeking help on behalf of her.

Cognitive distortions, thinking errors can be present in these situations which can lead to vicious cycle of emotional problems.

She will benefit by opening up and talking about her issues with a counsellor and/or a psychiatrist. She will benefit by getting an objective professional opinion and develop better coping strategies. Obviously your friend needs to accept and consent to seek professional help. Meanwhile try to continue supporting your friend. Talk to her regularly. Minimise her self-isolation. Try to not take things personally if she gets irritated. Gently persuade her to take up regular exercises. Start off by walking regularly for 15 to 20 minutes daily and gradually built up physical activities. Encourage her to eat healthy and regularly. Avoid too much coffee as it will not be helpful. Try to schedule regular fun activities like watching movies, playing together. Encourage her to seek professional help.

And I have no clue how severe I have it since I just saw him today for the first time for this and only test that was performed was the tapping on my wrist.","Doctor":"Hi. Greetings for a healthy future. I understand that you have symptoms of carpal tunnel syndrome in both hands. Regarding your questions about severity and surgery I hope following helps you. In order to know the exact cause and the severity of problem, it will be helpful to get objective test done. EMG NCV is a good test to reach a diagnosis of carpal tunnel syndrome. Also, it will be important to see if there are other risk factors- Thyroid disorders, endocrinal disorders, recent hormonal changes- pregnancy or pills, etc. Regarding steroid injections: Injections in hip are within the joint and hence long term effect will be wearing of the joint. In carpal tunnel syndrome, the injections are in carpal tunnel and if your symptoms have relieved completely after injection then it is the cause of your problems. So once carpal tunnel syndrome is diagnosed then you can opt for surgery depending on the severity of disease. My recommendation is to get EMG NCV test to confirm carpal tunnel syndrome, if very severe, then plan for surgery."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor,I am just wondering what is abutting and abutment of the nerve root means in a back issue.

Causes of throat pain can be infections in tonsils (i.e) tonsillitis or infection in the posterior wall of pharynx (i.e) pharyngitis.

Aceclofenac tablet twice daily for five days. 3) An antacid half an hour before food twice daily. 4) Antipyretic paracetamol twice daily if having a fever. 5) Salt water gargles and chewing lozenges three to four times a day also helps. 6) Drink plenty of hot fluids like tea, soup, etc. I hope this helps."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I had a positive ANA 320 but no symptoms.

HIV infection has a window period of one to three months during which the test results can be a false negative. Homosexual exposures have a higher risk of HIV transmission than other modes.

As your last test at 91 days after the exposure is negative, it can be concluded that you have not acquired HIV. You should consider yourself really lucky as you have had a high-risk exposure in the form of receptive homosexual anal intercourse. Kindly refrain from all such activities in the future too.

I have a throat infection with pain in swallowing which increases at night. I took Enzoflam two tablets per day for three days, but the pain still persists. Please advise.","Doctor":"Hello. The majority of throat infections are caused by viruses that cause the common cold and flu. Less often, sore throats are due to bacterial infections. Not all are viral or bacterial, other causes include an allergy to mold, pollen or other irritants or smoking cigarettes or even gastroesophageal reflux (in common words acidity). It is important to determine the cause, which will help to treat the symptoms. If you are having a fever with a lot of irritation or pain in the throat it is important to consult an ENT specialist in your town and get your throat examined. He will do a physical examination and examine the throat with a lighted instrument. He will also feel your neck for swollen lymph nodes. This will help to reach the diagnosis. If throat infection and fever last for more than five days, it is necessary to run blood tests. My advice on treatment: 1) Even if the cause is viral, there can be a bacterial added infection, so start on antibiotics. A combination of Amoxycillin with Clavulanic acid (625 mg) is good to be taken twice daily after food for five days. 2) Reduce inflammation and pain with Acetaminophen twice daily after food. Take an antacid with a pain killer to reduce gastric irritation. 3) Gargling with warm salt water or betadine gargles three to four times a day will help. 4) Drink plenty of warm fluids like tea, soup, and water. 5) Take throat lozenges. 6) Avoid allergens like dust and smoking.

Chronic pain is indicative of a more muscular pain etiology also known as Costochondritis. Pain around the left side of the chest, associated with gastric symptoms such as reflux, and acidity indicate GERD (gastric esophagal reflux disease). And then there is an anginal pain too. However, anginal pain is severe and it does not seem to be the case for you. I will advise you to take Brufen 400 mg twice daily for three days after food, and also Omeprazole 20 mg once daily before breakfast for the same duration. If the pain still persists, just to be on the safer side get an ECG (electrocardiogram) done and follow up with me."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, My infant daughter who is 8 weeks old is having stuffy nose and cough since yesterday.

Low CD count can be due to altered immune function or HIV. You have been investigated with the molecular tests for HIV. So after four to six weeks of exposure, it can definitely rule out HIV. If you have investigated early with a provided period then you have to repeat your HIV testing. For low folate, you can be prescribed folic acid tablet for one or two months. For low vitamin B12, cyanocobalamine injection can be prescribed once a week for eight weeks. If you have any specific clinical complaints or history then mention it to give further comment. I hope this helps."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I have been experiencing sexual dysfunction for the past 2.5 years, and I believe it is neurogenic in origin. This is because not only do I lack sensation, and am not responsive to touch in my penis when getting it erect. I cannot feel heat or cold temperatures on the glans of my penis either, which I think as signs of neuropathy. Although it is theoretically possible to block pleasure from a psychological standpoint, not feeling heat or cold in my genitals is not a clear sign of neuropathy? If so, are there any treatment options available, assuming no pinched nerves? I have done an MRI and that is clear.","Doctor":"Hello. Any psychological diagnosis needs evaluation for other causes and ruling out functional causes. So my recommendations would do a few investigations first : 1. Serum testosterone levels. 2. Thyroid profile. 3. Serum vitamin B12 assay. 4. MRI LS (magnetic resonance imaging of the lumbar spine) spine. However, as far as your query is concerned, yes psychologically one can have a loss of sensation over the penis. But as I said we need to first rule out any actual causes.

You have not not described about your habit like smoking or tobacco consumption and also not mentioned that these white lesion are painful or not, or making any discomfort during taking food. If there is any burning sensation or pain, then it may be associated with some local infection like fungal infection. Some time nutritional deficiency will also associate with these lesions.

I have severe anxiety, a kind fo shakes when arms are crossed, swollen lymph node on the left side of neck, sore wrists, muscle spasms in calves, and on outstretch the left arm gets fatigued. I have done MRI, EKG, and MRI cervical spine.","Doctor":"Hello. I understand your concern and would explain that ALS (amyotrophic lateral sclerosis) does not usually cause just fasciculation. It is usually associated to progressive paralysis and muscle wasting in the hands and legs. Other symptoms like troubles with swallowing, breathing occur later after some months. During physical exam pyramidal signs and diminished neurological reflexes can be seen (by the doctor). So, I do not think that your symptoms are related to ALS. On the other hand the inflamed lymph node in the neck is not related to ALS. Nevertheless, the nerve conduction studies would help to definitely exclude ALS. You should discuss it with your doctor on the above test. I would also advise checking vitamin D and vitamin B12 levels for possible deficiency, thyroid hormone levels for possible imbalances.

Serotonin syndrome will not occur when you consume high doses of SSRI (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors) and then stop abruptly. My advice to you would be a safer way out. You should continue with Dapoxetine 60 mg and avoid Tramadol. If you do not get adequate time, then add up anesthetic jelly.

I had a blow job, and inserted my finger in her vagina, and I am afraid because I might have rubbed my eyes after that. Am I at risk for HIV?","Doctor":"Hello. The chance of transmission of HIV by blow job is almost nil unless, there are bleeding wounds in both the partners, in the area of contact. It is very unlikely. So there is almost a nil chance. The transmission of HIV by finger insertion is also nil. Skin is an effective barrier. HIV does not survive in the environment or on hands for long. So the chances of transmission of HIV through eyes is very very minimal or nil. So the risk is almost nil. If she is negative there is no risk at all. You can get her tested. You can also get tested by antibodies test after three months of exposure. Else do an HIV RNA PCR test after 10 days of exposure."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I have busted my tooth about two months ago. I tried to consult a dentist. The first dentist told me a huge cost for pulling it and the titanium screw. Went to the second dentist for a second opinion. He said I have to wait for another two to four more weeks to even get started. Does this sound normal? Actually, I had a cap on the same tooth 18 months ago, and that busted directly above. I can feel with my tongue that it protrudes lower.","Doctor":"Hello. You have mentioned that the present tooth problem has been there for two months. You have already had a crown in the same tooth before eight months. Have you undergone a root canal treatment for the same? It would be better if you could attach the following: 1. An intraoral photograph of the affected tooth. 2. An x-ray (intraoral periapical radiograph) of the affected tooth. The exact diagnosis and the treatment plan can be decided after going through the above. Since you have been having the busted tooth for two months, I assume that there was either no pain or very minimal pain. Because if there was any abscess or infection related to that tooth, you might have had severe pain, pus discharge or swelling. So, the chances of acute infection are very minimal. There is no emergency and may be this is the reason why your dentist had asked to wait for two to four weeks. If there was any infection at present, your dentist might have put you under medications and would have asked you to come for extraction in three to four days. May be there is gross decay of tooth or there is no scope for saving the tooth, and that is why the dentist had advised extraction (pull out the tooth). I can comment on the treatment plan only after seeing the picture and x-ray. If you are going to get the tooth extracted, then it can be replaced by either implant (screw and cap) or fixed partial denture or removable partial denture depending upon your choice. I hope this helps."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I have a chronic onset of symptoms of foot drop, diagnosed by podiatrist last month. I would like to know if this could be caused by the original knee injury, which was diagnosed as a severe multi-ligament knee injury. Is it possible for a severe multi-ligament knee injury, with a complete tear of the ACL, to cause \\"foot drop\\" to develop years later? I am currently taking Naproxen. Actually my original knee injury happened in 1969 and got repaired in 1980. Knee remained unstable and worn a brace since 1981. I have consulted many orthopedic surgeons, who all state that repair of the ACL is not possible.","Doctor":"Hello. I understand that the ACL (anterior cruciate ligament) surgery was done in 1980 whereas the injury was in 1969. It must be ACL reconstruction surgery or some other augmentation surgery. The original ligament cannot be repaired after 11 years. It will be beneficial to know about the procedure performed which can suggest what was done. In some cases foot drop may present after the procedure but it may be immediately or within the first few week or a month. It is unlikely to get recent onset foot drop due to the surgery performed in 1980. There might be some other cause of foot drop if it is recent.

As you have described it is changing color so that color change will be due to pigments change in the blood. Is there any trauma history?

Now it smells, and looks pale brown color. I am scared, is it infected?","Doctor":"Hello. Breaking of a part of the tooth is termed as tooth fracture. There are a number of types of tooth fractures. A few of them are symptomatic and cause pain. These require immediate attention. A few other types do not cause pain immediately. But they might show color changes, tooth mobility, swelling of gums, pus collection, abscess, bad breath (halitosis), and tooth migration later in life. In your case, the tooth would have become non-vital (dead) and hence the pale brown color change. The causes of bad breath are either abscess formation associated with pus collection or food lodgment in the fractured tooth. Kindly attach intraoral photos and give a detailed history of the trauma to the tooth for further follow-up. Tooth at this stage can be saved. If delayed you may lose the tooth and will have to replace it with an artificial tooth."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor,I am just wondering what is abutting and abutment of the nerve root means in a back issue.

A 4 mm size lesion on my left lung has been watched for two years with no changes. I have been having pain on the right side and in my arm and back. I also have shortness of breath. Recently chest x-ray showed increased interstitial markings on the right side. Should a CT scan be recommended to investigate this further?","Doctor":"Hello. Reading in between the lines of your query, your worry about having cancer for the third time stands out clearly, and very naturally so. The language of your query also reveals how scrupulous and conscientious you have been in terms of follow-up. It is a pleasure to be talking with such a sincere patient. Here, I will try to explain your present situation and alleviate your worries as best as I can. Since the left lung lesion has been unchanged for two years, it is unlikely to be related to your previous history of cancers. So, if it is still unchanged, it should not be a cause of worry. The \\"increased interstitial markings\\" may or may not represent lymphangitis carcinomatosa (LC) a type of lung cancer. Although this condition is mostly seen in addition to pre-existing cancer in the lungs or elsewhere, and there are also be some other findings on the chest x-ray, such as pleural effusion (collection of fluid around lungs), hilar lymph nodes (which appear as round masses in between the lungs). The chest x-ray may even be normal in 30 - 50% cases of lymphangitis carcinomatosa. However, increased interstitial markings may also represent a lot many other conditions unrelated to cancer and so, your treating doctor may want to first treat the condition like infection and go for the CT scan afterward, if the markings persist after treatment. Since the additional findings (effusion, lymph nodes, etc.) are not seen, and since you do not have a diagnosis of or complaints related to underlying cancer at present, I would say that you may first follow the treatment regimen planned by your treating doctor, and may go for the CT scan if the marking persist after that treatment. I hope this helps."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I have a problem with breath odor and yellowish teeth. How to solve this problem? Can I use Sensodyne toothpaste?","Doctor":"Hello. Breath odor might be due to tartar deposits on the teeth, gum problems, decayed teeth, improper tongue cleaning, frequent intake of onion and garlic, or any gastrointestinal disorders. Yellow teeth might be due to plaque and calculi on teeth, staining due to smoking or betel nut and paan chewing, or internal staining. These conditions can be treated by: Scaling and polishing (to be done by the dentist), followed by brushing twice daily. Use of an antibacterial mouthwash. Proper tongue cleaning. Avoiding intake of onion and garlic. Quitting the habit of smoking or betel nut and paan chewing (if any). Consult a general physician if breath odor persists even after following the above-mentioned treatments (to rule out gastrointestinal disorders). Use of Sensodyne is not recommended for your dental issue."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, How long the effect of anti-D and abortion last in the body?","Doctor":"Hello,  Welcome to icliniq.com. The effect of anti D will last forever until there is another exposure in Rh -ve woman of an Rh +ve blood in the form of blood transfusion or Rh +ve pregnancy. Usually, first pregnancy is spared as the Rh +ve cells when entering the maternal blood at the time of feto maternal hemorrhage like during labor, or rupture of membranes or abortion, there is sensitization of cells and no harm. But when again in second pregnancy there is a transfer of cells, there is Ag- Ab (antigen-antibody) reaction and hemolysis, means the breakdown of red cells and harm to the fetus in the form of anemia, hydrops, etc. That is why we give an injection of anti D to prevent the sensitization of these cells."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am 42 years old with type 1 diabetes for the last 21 years. I am also on dialysis thrice a week, and my insulin requirement increasing day by day. I was taking 8 units per meal four years ago, but now I am having 40 units per meal. Kindly guide how to decrease the insulin units.","Doctor":"Hello. The fact remains that you are probably having insulin-dependent diabetes. In this case, your sugars will rise. This is because the pancreas produces a lesser and lesser amount of insulin on their own. As that happens, the need for insulin will keep climbing. There are two chief things you can do to decrease the insulin need. One is to reduce your diet and calory intake. The second is to maintain your weight. I will need your exact height and weight to be able to calculate the calory intake. Also, you are on dialysis.

However, the likely possibility is lumbar spondylosis with nerve compressions.

Physiotherapy would be helpful. You may continue to have Aleve (Naproxen) according to need. You may use local Diclofenac gel or hot water fomentation.

I suggest if there was no cause found on ultrasound and the uterus is well involuted and clean, then the likely cause is progesterone imbalance.

These pills would serve as contraception as well as they would stop your ovulation and menses. It has to be taken continuously without a break of packs for six months, the moment you miss or defaulter, your withdrawal bleed shall occur.

The swelling goes down after I stop eating, but the area feels numb for a long time after that. What can cause this? I have chronic urticaria and MGUS.","Doctor":"Hello. I have carefully reviewed your health query and will answer your concerns. The issues you mentioned are related to mastication (chewing). It is a process where you have to put a lot of energy, and the muscles of mastication are widely used. It seems there is some neuropathy causing the muscles of mastication to get fatigued. Other symptoms like swelling and numbness can be a feeling due to the same muscles spasms. Local edema (fluid accumulation) can also be a reason behind the swelling. Regarding MGUS (monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance), I want to add that it can lead to multiple myeloma, so keep an eye on your health. Keep a timely follow-up with your treating physician. I suggest you try using anti-inflammatory medications like Acetaminophen, which can help you. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start using the medicine after there consent. Also, ask your physician to take care of urticaria, as this can be an additive factor.

I have taken antibiotics on a regular basis as there is redness, swelling and tenderness in the area when inflamed. Approximately 2 weeks ago this cyst on my nose became very inflamed or infected. I was experiencing headache, sore neck, painful and uncomfortable nose and facial pressure (swelling), pressure in my ears and dry infected eye that too right side consequently. I visited GP and had CT scan of paranasal sinuses. I hope you could provide me the explanation for the below sentence, which I am unable to understand. The nasal septum deviates towards the right associated with a large right sided bony spur which abuts the right middle turbinate. Pneumatization of the left middle turbinate (concha bullosa) noted. In simple terms what does this mean? What is the likely recommended action for this? Are these comments and findings consistent with the symptoms I have experienced?","Doctor":"Hi. It means there is obstruction to your sinus drainage because of a deviated nasal septum with spur and concha bullosa, leading to recurrent sinusitis. Due to retained secretions in the paranasal sinuses there is infection and headache. Nasal septum deviation to the right means that the central bone of your nose is not straight and is bent towards the right side. A surgical procedure called septoplasty is done to correct the deviated nasal septum. It is an intranasal operative procedure may be performed under local or general anesthesia. Turbinates are bony structures that project from the side of the nose that function to humidify and warm the air. Concha bullosa is presence of an air cell inside the turbinate. The middle turbinates have an inner core of thin, single-layered bone covered with the normal nasal membranes. Occasionally that bone can get pneumatized and results in a much bulkier structure. This will lead to blockage of breathing passages as well as obstruction of sinus drainage path leading to sinusitis. A prolonged course of intranasal steroid sprays with short course of oral steroids along with nasal decongestants is usually tried before planning for surgery. Persistent of symptoms post medical treatment is an indication for endoscopic surgery. 1. DNS (deviated nasal septum). 2. Concha bullosa. Sinusitis. 1. Septoplasty 2. Endoscopic surgery.

As you have described, your father had brain infarct after that he developed all symptoms related to eye right.

So for treatment of his eyelids, only surgery you can plan but you should consult oculoplastic surgeon for that.

Many dentists give pain medications and antibiotics before discharging the patient (after the procedure).

I have type 1 diabetes mellitus and I am taking Insulin for it.","Doctor":"Hi. As you said, you have pulmonary nodule with calcifications in the upper lung, it suggests old infection of the lung and calcification denotes it as a benign lesion. Any healing in our body has a tendency of getting calcified over the period of time. But, that does not mean it is something serious or surgery can permanently heal it. Till date, there is no surgery, which is specially advised for removing these types of calcifications. Even if it is removed, there are chances of recalcification again over the time period. There are different rules for applying for jobs overseas in different countries. The main aim is to identify any communicable lung infection, like tuberculosis, which is active to prevent spread to the other residents. Calcified lung nodules itself are old healed lesions and not considered as a matter of rejection in any job in the absence of other symptoms of the disease.

A day after the sedative filling, I am still experiencing a lot of pain. Is this normal? When should I consider going back to the dentist?","Doctor":"Hello. I have gone through your issue. Since you have pain after sedative/temporary filling, this indicates the tooth is either non-vital or the cavity has reached the pulp (blood supply of tooth). So, kindly visit the dentist, take an X-ray (intraoral periapical radiograph) of the tooth. Get the filling removed and get root canal treatment done. You can take antibiotics too based on the X-ray and clinical findings, which will be prescribed by your dentist. Once the canals are exposed and the compression from the filling is removed, the pain will be relieved. If you have an X-ray, send that along with a photo of the tooth to guide you better. Also, we need to check whether the pain is from somewhere else or due to food lodgement between teeth or gum pain and treatment will vary accordingly. If the cause is that filled tooth, then removal of filling and root canal treatment will help. Do not worry, you will be fine. Take care.

I have always had some forms of anxiety from time to time as well. More recently, however, I began to make strides to come out of my depression and started being happy and living life again, but I have noticed a very strange and crippling symptom that I acquired at some point in my life, that seems to maybe be getting worse. Basically, it feels as though my senses are dulled, and my perception of the world around me is severely limited. My thought patterns have become very slow and disjointed, and my day to day activities especially when alone is very very basic and boring. It is almost as if my brain is no longer autonomously processing information around me, creating memories, stimulating me with thoughts and ideas. I feel empty and blank. The severity of this feeling fluctuates and it seems to improve sometimes, especially if I am not feeling overly anxious or if I do positive things like working out or meditating. I do not know how much of this I can attribute to pure psychology and I am worried more and more that there is something physically wrong with my brain. It almost feels dementia like. My short-term or the working memory can be extremely short-lived and sometimes when thinking through pretty basic thoughts or narratives or plotlines or solving simple problems, I easily forget what I was thinking about or I cannot hold the pieces of information long enough in my head to make sense of them. Most of the time, it is not that I do not understand the problem it is just that I am trying to wrap my head around. Rather, I will be able to fully explain it to myself and come to the answer, but still for some reason be unclear as to whether I truly got it or not, and so then I will force myself to go through the logic of the problem again and again until I am satisfied with how much it has been \\"solidified\\" in my head. I might not have articulated this too well, but I am only saying it to underscore that this seems to be more a problem of information processing rather than my analytical abilities. I have found that my long-term memory seems to be somewhat stronger. This is especially true for memories formed a long time ago, which leads me to believe that maybe my recent short-term memory problems are also preventing me from encoding enough information in the moment to create vivid memories. Anyways, whatever this is, it has been further exacerbated by my intense focus on the problem, which is preventing me from being happy and sending me back into depression. I am seeing a neurologist in two months but I really do not want to wait that long to talk to someone. Meanwhile, I would love some insight or opinions on what this might be. Sorry if this explanation was somewhat rambly and disjointed. I am not very good at putting this problem into words so let me know if there is anything I should clarify or elaborate on further. Of note, I am on Advair and Albuterol and in the past, I have been on Wellbutrin. The onset of these symptoms seems to have maybe been gradual but my acknowledgment of how bad they are was definitely more abrupt and coincided with my efforts in trying to climb back into the real world after my depressive episode. Another strange symptom that has presented itself for a while is ED and I have been concerned that the presentation of ED with neurological symptoms could suggest MS. Are my worries valid?

She is finding very difficult to trust people. Extreme suspicious behaviour towards all including me and easily lies on anything and make the conversation complicated. She is emotionally cold towards others and no sense of guilt even if she gets angry on small issues or when committed any mistake. She suffers from mood swing with anger outburst. She slaps herself and bang her head against wall. She believe that she has a sixth sense and prejudge the people by telling something bad is going to happen. She behaves overemotional, dramatic, irrational reasoning and weeping without tears. She has fear of locking herself in toilet or room. So, she will keep the door open at home or outside. She suffers with forgetfulness and unable to concentrate on anything. She used to keep re-checking the things in kitchen. She used to keep things in order and gets very disturbed and upset if things are not in the place. Feel dirt everywhere and keep on cleaning.  She is reluctant on spending money. Despite having hand dermatitis she carries a wet cloth whole day and clean and urge to wash hand repetitively. From 8 AM to 4 PM she will be engaged in household job, But, she do not feel to take rest or sleepy in noon or at night. Once she is exhausted physically and mentally then only she feels sleepy. Her sleep problem urge her watching horror or investigative movies late night. She often gets sad and scary dreams and murmurs at night to herself. She visualises images whenever she is alone and trying to hold the imaginary figure in air and talk to them. She gets negative depressive thoughts often and suicidal threat whenever in anger. I request you to evaluate her condition based on the above and provide further line of treatment accordingly. My further request is to perform personality test if required to confirm her actual personality disorder or any other available tool for her assessment and plan the treatment accordingly.My doubts are, is this ailment hereditary and spread to my kids too? Is this a completely curable one? In her current state of mind when she is not accepting her ailment and occasional anger outburst and suicidal threat, what could be the severity of her disease in future? What should be the future course of management for her? I would appreciate your insight and further assessment. Thanks.","Doctor":"Hi. I have read the detailed history that you have mentioned in your query and I can understand your concern. The symptoms does not fit in a particular personality type and this is the reason why she has been diagnosed with different personalities. As you have mentioned that her symptoms are present since childhood so apart from personality disorders other conditions should also be ruled out like bipolar disorder or some psychotic episode. Fear of locking in toilet, mistrust, etc., suggest anxiety. Visualising images, repetitive work pattern, keeping things in order, jealousy, obsessive ideas of cleanliness, feeling dirt everywhere, etc., are pointing towards OCD. She is not accepting her illness and this means she has lost insight related to her illness.

Our family friend suggested me to consume Kalarchikai medicine, powdered mixed with pepper and honey to have it for one mandalam (48 days). I have completed nearly 44 days by consuming one small ball of the mixture every morning and before two weeks I got my periods. Then I had checked whether the cysts were dissolved by having an abdomen scan. But still, small multiple follicules have been seen in it with both ovaries enlarged. Kindly suggest me what I can do further. I got married before one and a half years and I am much worried about my pregnancy. I have gallstones as well.","Doctor":"Hello. I just read your query. See Kalarachi Kai choornam is helpful in amenorrhea. As far as small cysts are concerned they are unmatured eggs which failed to induce menstrual cycle previously, as a result, they got collected in the ovary and they will remain in the ovary. Now, you have got your periods you can start trying for conception. But I advise you to do it under the supervision of a nearby gynecologist because egg size is important while conception and that you can know by ovulation study. Ovulation study is performed under the supervision of a gynecologist. For gall stones, surgical intervention is required generally. Medicine is not of much help."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I am 49 years old and I have been drinking approximately 350 ml of vodka every day for approximately 10-15 years. I also have smoked half pack a day for 30 years but just recently quit. For the past year and a half (maybe even two years) I have had diarrhea daily. I went to a doctor who prescribed IBS medicine and B12 shots, but nothing changed. My stomach is large, distended, and hard. When I eat half a sandwich or six bites of salad, I am so bloated I cannot move. I feel a dull bruise like pain (very dull) in my lower right quadrant from time to time maybe once every two weeks. My AST and ALT levels are high (112 and 113), glucose is 116, absolute eosinophils are 720H. I have attached my lab reports. My guess is, this is liver disease, pancreas disease, or diabetes. Any ideas? Do I have to quit drinking? Or can I cut back? I am currently taking Stelara for psoriasis.","Doctor":"Hello. I think there are multiple issues. You need proper workup. Your ALT (alanine transaminase) / AST (aspartate transaminase) are due to alcohol-related liver disease, better is to do USG (ultrasound) abdomen.  Other issues are, I had gone through your blood reports (attachment removed to protect patient identity). Your hemoglobin and hematocrit are in range of polycythemia vera which is a blood coagulation disorder. So what is feel is you need a good doctor hematologist for polycythemia and related to your gastric issues. USG abdomen and endoscopy with biopsy can be done if possible, as this will tell us liver and pancreas status as alcohol affects both. Second thing, stop smoking which is a culprit for your high Hb so to get that worked up there are series of tests need to be done. My advice is to choose a good doctor to get everything thing done."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, During masturbation I just rub the tip of the penis and not the entire penis. Is it a wrong way of doing?

I have problems with my beard. My beard grows in patches, only in certain parts of my face. The remaining areas are clear without any facial hair. It makes me look awkward. Does any supplement encourage hair growth and solve my problem. Is that possible doctor?","Doctor":"Hello. Beard and mustache are said to be secondary sexual characters. Some people may not get the full area of beard distribution at a young age. The area and thickness of facial hair increases as you grow. Repeated shaving also increases the possibility of hair growth and thickness. But you should also know that there are chances of some treatable causes like fungal infections or a condition called alopecia areata which commonly affect the facial hair growth. Have a balanced diet with high proteins, vitamins, and minerals. You can also take Biotin supplements. Get back to a dermatologist online with clear facial photos, to rule out the causes for incomplete facial hair growth -->"},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, What makes the cheeks inside the mouth look like tear. There is no bleeding and ulcer. There is some burning during the day and it quits overnight.","Doctor":"Hello. As per your information, it is not a case to worry about. In cases that need attention, the cheeks become reddened painful rigid or ulcerated. Your case seems to have arisen due to cheek bite. Make sure you grind off the sharp edges of the teeth which are in contact with the cheeks. Prolonged cheek bite can cause ulceration and can cause pain. Also, if you have unerupted wisdom teeth on either side, cheek bites on those areas can also cause some sort of a burning sensation. So get in touch with your dentist to get the problem corrected. Avoid having too much spicy food in the meantime."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I have been experiencing a pain on the left side of my stomach with passing gas and burping in the stomach. My stool is green and there is no sign of blood and no vomiting. I have been to the doctor and he gave me Nexium and Ranitidine for three days. Also, I was feeling a little better after three days dose. On the fourth day, I felt belly discomfort and burning comes and goes mostly at night. Last night I felt a heat sensation on my neck. The next day I took the pills and the burning feel on the left side of the stomach and heat sensation a neck seems to get cooled. I feel like mucus or something is in my throat. Should I be worried? Also, I get random aches all over the body.","Doctor":"Hello.  I understand your concern. Pain on the left side of the abdomen, along with burping and stomach pain are all suggestive of colitis. Since your stool is also green in color, it is advisable that you get your stool examined for parasites and ova. The sensation in the neck seems to be unrelated to your colitis, however, it could be due to acid reflux. Ranitidine will help and you need to continue. For such colitis, I will advise Ofloxacin and Ornidazole twice daily for five days. Random aches are also suggestive of colitis and infection. So start the medicine and get your stool evaluated. You can follow up once the reports are ready."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am 21 years old. I am very disappointed with my doctor. I have an epididymal cyst that hurts now, and my other testicle is hurting as well. Should I sue my urologist for negligence? What is the best cure or treatment? Please suggest.","Doctor":"Hello. Around 15-20 % of the males have an epididymal cyst and most patients do not manifest any symptoms. It could be an incidental finding while checking for something else. However, when it starts hurting, there is a possibility of infection all the time, and hence, if it starts causing so much discomfort it is better to get it operated. You need to do a scrotal ultrasound to find out why the other testicle has started hurting and if there is an ongoing infection, you can start treatment without any further delay. If your urologist is not helping, kindly consult some other urologist who will be operating the cyst out. Otherwise, it will not stop hurting. There is no medical management for this."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am a 28-year-old male. Two years ago, I lost my upper retainers. My front teeth got separated, creating a gap. What should I do to fix my teeth, or should I want braces again?","Doctor":"Hello. To restart the fixed appliance treatment all over again will depend on the gaps present. If the gaps are large, the dentist would recommend you to out braces again. If the gaps are negligible, removable retainers can be worn which can close the gaps. But then again, the dentist will have to thoroughly look into the feasibility of putting the braces again before actually starting the treatment. In some cases, the relapses are so severe that we refrain from putting braces again. At the same time, some cases with retreatment have given beautiful results. Make sure you have a good discussion with your dentist regarding the outcome before starting the treatment."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, Every time I train fitness, my head is warm and I get fever and headcaches after training. Please help.","Doctor":"Hello,  Welcome to icliniq.com. From your history it is obvious that you are suffering from exercise headache. During exercise your muscle heats up, this results in dilatation of blood vessels that causes increased blood flow to the brain, skin. This heat should be removed from the body so the skin produces sweat, as the sweat evaporates the body heat is removed with it. But in strenuous exercise, if the sweat is not evaporated, the body becomes more warmth. So always eat and drink before exercise. Exercise headache are of two types, primary and secondary. The primary headache is harmless that includes a throbbing headache, headache on both sides, but the secondary headache is dangerous which includes vomiting, loss of consciousness, and double vision. Whatever it is consult a doctor immediately to rule out any underlying cause of headache."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am a 21-year-old male. When I talk to someone they said I have bad breath, and do brush and come back again. But I always clean my tongue properly. Most of the people whom I have talked about said I have bad breath.","Doctor":"Hello. Bad breath or halitosis is a common problem. There are a number of potential causes and treatments available. Simple home remedies, and lifestyle changes, such as improved dental hygiene and quitting smoking, can often remove the issue. The best method to reduce halitosis is good oral hygiene. This ensures that cavities are avoided and reduces the likelihood of gum disease. Treatment: 1) Mouth rinses and tooth pastes. 2) Brush your teeth after you eat. 3) Floss at least once a day. 4) Brush your tongue. 5) Avoid dry mouth. 6) Adjust your diet. I suggest taking Metrogyl 400 mg thrice daily for three days, tablet Taxim (Cefixime) 200 twice daily for three days, and Pantocid-D once daily for three days."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am a 31-year-old female. I think I have pinworms. My butt (perineal and anus area) kept vibrating like a cellphone, about once every two seconds, all day. I started taking probiotics and now it is not as constant, but happens many times a day still. I researched it, and some people say it could be worms. I took Reese's Pinworm medicine and there were a few small half to one-inch white worms. My anus itches every now and then. Two days in a row it was very itchy. But it is not extra itchy at night, which is supposed to be the main symptom. I do feel them especially at night and it disgusts me. Do you think the cellphone-like vibrating is because of the worms? I am very disgusted, upset, and terrified. I think I got it from eating kale and spinach that I did not wash. I do work in a school, too. I heard apple cider vinegar is supposed to create an uninviting atmosphere for them. Does that mean if I drink it they will start coming out of me in various places, and alive or will I just poop them out? And garlic and carrots, would I just poop them out dead after eating these? I want to take lots of things to be rid of them, but do not want to see anything come out except my anus, and must be dead. I took the medicine only for four days. Will they take a while to go away?","Doctor":"Hello. I understand your concern. I will advise not to use the apple cider vinegar, but garlic and carrots can be taken, and they will help in further elimination of the pinworms. It will come out only through your anus, and not through anywhere else. You have taken the pinworm solution, so that complete elimination may take around a week. Since there was almost immediate evacuation the next day, it is a good sign and it will keep coming out. I will also advise you to take Mebendazole 150 mg separately, and that will also help in the treatment. It can be taken as a single dose at bedtime. This excessive itching could be due to the concentration of the organisms in the tract and it will slowly get better. You have already taken medicine and a course of Mebendazole will further help in the treatment."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am a 35-year-old male.

Pus cells: 4-6 Red blood cells: Nil Epithelial Cells: 1-2 Miscellaneous: Nil. Note: This specimen is taken at the lab.","Doctor":"Hello. I have seen your semen analysis report and the following is my opinion: Pus cell count (units not given) appears to be high. If the unit is 4-6 cells/hpf counted in the semen analysis chamber, it comes to 1-1.5 million cells/mL. High pus cells in semen may indicate infection. The simplest way to check infection is to do one semen culture test. If any offending organism is found, you need to take antibiotics (according to sensitivity report) for three to six weeks. Kindly do not take antibiotics if streptococcus or staphylococcus are found, as these are mostly contaminants and rarely cause semen infection. The volume of semen is a little high. High volume increases chances of all semen coming out after intercourse, but should not be a cause of concern. Coming to your problem of infertility: For pregnancy to occur, apart from normal semen, your wife's regular ovulation and open tubes are required. Has your wife undergone any evaluation? If yes, you can get back to me with reports for further advice."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I had a CBC (complete blood count) done yesterday and it came back with elevated WBC of 13500, with neutrophils 9000 (more or less), ESR 36, and close to normal lymphocytes.

Following is my opinion for your asked question. Your total count and neutrophils are elevated. So it could be due to bacterial infection or stress as per provided history. You can complete the course of antibiotics. Meanwhile, try to reduce stress and anxiety by yoga, exercise, breathing exercises, etc. You can be prescribed anti-anxiety medication for stress.

I want to build body in the gym. What should I do?","Doctor":"Hello. As far as gaining muscle mass is concerned there are two important things. One is doing regular work out and the other more important thing is diet. In diet you should remember that proteins are the part of the diet which form the muscle mass. If you are a non-vegetarian you can eat eggs, chicken and if you are a vegetarian you can eat lots of pulses and soyabeans and nuts. You better take your meals more frequently like three major meals and three snacks. There are good protein shakes available in the market too if you are ready to spend some money too. The amount of carbohydrates and fats should be decreased a little in your diet because they will increase your fat content in the body and it is not good if you are looking for a muscular body. But they should form a part of your meal as they also have importance in our body for the normal functioning of the body.

I had intercourse with a female sex worker five years ago. Since then I do not have any sex with any one. Now I am getting married in a few months. So I took a pre-marital checkup and the result was nil and non-reactive for HIV, HSV 1 AND 2, HCV, HBS, chlamydia, and syphilis. But I am worried about HPV. I did not get any warts but still, I am afraid. Are there any risk of HPV related cancers for me or my partner?","Doctor":"Hello. I have gone through your query. Presently there are no tests to confirm HPV (human papillomavirus) infection in males. Warts can develop even years after the infection is acquired, therefore it is never really possible to know whether you are infected or not unless you develop a clinically visible lesion. Since you never had any visible growths or warts on the genitalia during all these years, therefore, it is likely that you are free of infection and never even acquired it in the first instance. Regarding the risk of cancer, only certain types of HPV (e.g) HPV type 6, 11, 16, and 18 are associated with an increased risk of cervical cancer in females, and not in males. In females, PAP (Papanicolaou) smear can be performed every year to look for any atypical cells. I think you can go ahead with your marriage without any fears at this time because there is no way you can even know whether you are infected or not."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am a 24-year-old male with no past medical history.

I have diagnosed your problem, it looks from your photographs although it is not very clear that you are suffering from anal fissure. May I know if you have occasional constipation and if you have work that has a more sedentary lifestyle? I suggest you to have leafy vegetables, salads, high fiber diet, cabbages, and spinach so that you do not have constipation. Next, you can buy Dabur Isabgul powder and take two teaspoons in one glass of water or milk. You can take at bedtime, and drink plenty of water. Apply Anovate ointment (Beclomethasone dipropionate) in the raw area where you have pain after passing stool. Get back to me after three days and let us see if it works or not.

Does she sleep well? Did you notice any change in her breathing pattern like fast breathing? If she is feeding well, sleeps well and no breathing difficulty, then it is a simple common cold for which no medication is required at this age. The only thing is to keep the nostrils clean and open. I suggest normal saline nasal drops two drops every four hours for three days.

I am taking insulin two times a day. I have attached my file.","Doctor":"Hello. I read your query and gone through your reports. (attachment removed to protect patient identity). It appears that you have gestational diabetes and cord around the neck of the baby. Now, this is a complicated pregnancy and you must follow a senior gynecologist with an MD degree and significant experience in dealing with such complicated pregnancies because of the cord around the neck of the fetus. Secondly, now I will come to the diabetes part. I saw that you are taking Novomix. However, during pregnancy, the insulin should be insulin Apidra 3-3-3 units during breakfast, lunch, and dinner and insulin Levemir 4 units before bedtime. You have to measure your blood sugar with a home checking glucometer and write your daily fasting, two hours post-meal, just before meals and before bedtime blood sugar chart and insulin taken. You must report that chart weekly to your diabetologist and get your insulin adjusted accordingly. If your blood sugar falls below 100 mg/dL then, you must eat something and report to your diabetologist immediately. So I hope that you understand that you must seriously follow a senior MD gynecologist with experience in the pregnancy with a cord around the neck of the fetus which is a serious issue and change your type of insulin and follow up with the chart of blood sugar measurements weekly with the diabetes doctor. Please maintain a low carbohydrate diet and avoid sugar consumption in any form at all times. I hope this helps. Diabetes. Blood sugar monitoring. Gestational diabetes.

Sometimes using marijuana can cause depersonalization-derealization symptoms. You seem to experience something like that. It can happen to anyone. Smoking weed is one of the possible causes. Usually, these symptoms will fade away with time. Do not worry. If these symptoms are persistent and affecting your normal functioning, consult a psychiatrist in your city for evaluation. Psychotherapy like CBT (cognitive behavioral therapy), can be helpful. Sometimes, if there is any associated depression or anxiety, medication can be prescribed. Avoid smoking cannabis again.

The ketogenic diet or low carbohydrate diet is helpful in weight reduction and should be done under trained nutritionist guidance. Self keto diet experience is not advisable. Although it is useful, the long term keto diet is not advisable as per my opinion. In keto diet, carbohydrate is not used as its intake is very less. The body will use the fat directly for metabolism and so ketone bodies can form. It can lead to ketosis in a diabetic patient and very rarely in normal person. Some study suggests that ketosis not harmful. But as per my opinion, it is better not to the take risk and avoid long-term keto diet. Keto diet can lead to diarrhea as well.

I am experiencing vision issues (not blindness) that come every other day and stop only when I sleep. I used to take Artane for my vision problem that was caused by psychotic medicines, but Artane interacts with Abilify, and I can no longer take it. Can you suggest any other non-side effect medication to help with my vision problem or possibly a different antipsychotic medication? I have also tried Promethazine and it does not help. I have tried most of the antipsychotics and have had various problems with them. For instance, I was doing great on Latuda for a few years and then developed neuroleptic malignant syndrome from Latuda and had to switch to another medicine. So while I am open to changing from Abilify to another antipsychotic that hopefully does not cause vision problems, I have noticed most of the antipsychotics do in fact have vision changes listed as a side effect. Abilify works well on my bipolar symptoms and I am functioning well. I am employed full-time and feel calm, logical, motivated, and positive about life. It is the vision side effects that I desperately wish to get rid of. I looked into a new medication called Vraylar and read that it can also cause vision problems. Please advise me on what you think I should do. The vision problem is difficult to live with, I am dealing as best as I can but it is hard when it happens during work. It causes me to focus my vision on minutiae and it is hard to relax. To sum up, I am either trying to find a medication to help stop vision problems from my antipsychotic or be advised on a good antipsychotic that does not cause vision problems or changes.","Doctor":"Hello. So I understand that you are having ocular side effects with the use of abilify. There are a few ways to go about it. As you have mentioned that you are stable on the medication and functional, I would advise you to consult an opthalmologist and get a checkup done and see if they can suggest some symptomatic treatment to control the ocular symptoms. If it does not help you can ask your psychiatrist to either try to lower the dose which might help with the side effects, because as you said you are otherwise stable on this medication, so we have to try sticking to it. If that is also not possible, then we can think about changing the medication. Medications like Olanzapine, Quetiapine, Asenapine work well in bipolar disorder. As I see Haloperidol and Risperidone have already been tried. So we can avoid those. You can take an opinion of your current psychiatrist and start one of these medications. I hope this helps."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, Is fatigue a sign of labor? What are the early signs of labor? How to find the difference between normal fatigue and fatigue that is abnormal or unusual? Please give some tips on combating pregnancy fatigue? What to do if someone is experiencing high levels of fatigue at the end of pregnancy? Can it be a sign of something else?","Doctor":"Hello. As pregnancy advances, the plasma volume increases and subsequently the iron supplements reduces. This reduction in hemoglobin cause weakness, and in advanced pregnancy stage due to big stomach, there will be backpain and weakness. But it is necessary to differentiate labor pain and backpain. Backpain in association with urinary tract infection, vaginal or pelvic infection, cervical incompetence, and previous history of preterm birth can trigger labor pain. Getting treatment for the health issues will avoid triggering effects. Fatigue is not necessarily a sign if labour. Pain in the abdomen from back to down in an episodic manner along with leakage or water discharge, unable to stand or walk due to pain, all these can be signs of labour. Pale face, cyanosed blue nails, headache, vertigo without any sickness is not normal. Balanced diet, iron and calcium supplements, and daily walk can avoid fatigue.

I heard that the FDA issued a warning but am not sure if it is true or not. I am in my mid-20s, male with no medical conditions. I sometimes feel mentally tired because of work and responsibilities. I believe I need something to boost my brain to help me function better. I have to wake up at 5:30 am almost every day. Are there any recommendations? What should I do?","Doctor":"Hello. It is a fact that the FDA (Food and drug administration) has issued a warning because of some potentially serious side effects of Prevagen and in fact FDA is planning to take legal action against the firm who manufactures and promotes Provagen. Provagen is promoted as a brain vitamin which is a myth and moreover FDA has asked the company to label it as a \\"DRUG\\" and not as a \\"SUPPLEMENT\\". Provagen contains an ingredient called Apoaequorin. The potential side effects of Provagen include stroke, seizures, emotional instability, behavioural changes, and tremors. I would strongly recommend you stop taking Provagen, and instead of that you should use and adopt natural things like meditation, regular exercise, lifestyle modification, etc., to deal with everyday stress. I hope this helps."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I woke up suddenly at 1'o clock in the night to urinate. I have a burning sensation after that. I woke up once an hour until about 5 am and having the same problem. There was only little urination, and the burning sensation started to decrease after each time I urinate. At around 4 am, I noticed light pink spotting on the toilet paper after the first wipe. It has occurred all day and at 6 pm the burning has almost completely disappeared. I am due for my period in seven days and I had unprotected sex eight and 13 days ago. A little concerned, I had UTI in the past and never had any spotting. I have googled, possible implantation bleeding, and took an EPT two days ago, and it turned out negative. I want a little more possible explanation.","Doctor":"Hello. This can well be an implantation bleed considering you have had unprotected sex recently unless proven otherwise. The EPT (early pregnancy test) test is not sensitive enough during the cycle at all, and can only detect the hCG levels on the seventh day post missed period. The pregnancy can be rather confirmed with a blood serum beta hCG level, which if found to be raised indicates pregnancy. If this test is negative and pregnancy is ruled out, then the spotting can be attributed to breakthrough bleeding due to lower levels of progesterone immediately after delayed ovulation as in this case possibly causing a small scanty withdrawal bleed. You need to furnish details about your LMP (last menstrual period) and regularity of cycles to comment further."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, My son is 42 days old. His activities are normal, but his TSH level is 5.6 miu /ml and lab normal range is 4-8 miu/ml and his total T4 level is 8.6 mcg/dl and my lab normal level is, 4-8 miu /ml. My doctor says that he is in borderline and needs treatment as the correlation between two hormone level is not correct. Is this true? Please help.","Doctor":"Hello. TSH of 5.6 is high normal and T4 of 8.6 is fine. If this is the first time you are checking it, repeat after five days, do a free T3, free T4, and TSH next time. They are better interpreters. Correlation between the hormone levels seems to be fine. The condition which we are worried about is hypothyroidism, where the body has low T3 or T4, because of which TSH is high. Sometimes when the reports are difficult to interpret, it is always better to repeat and confirm.  Thyroid is concerned with overall development, especially of the brain, the early we start treatment, the better. But over treatment is also not advisable. So better repeat the test, if TSH is coming down, no need to start the treatment."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I am a 22-year-old female who often suffers constipation to the point where I feel like I get minor external hemorrhoids that often bleed.

But if you do frequently it is bad for your health. How to stop the addiction of masturbation? Stay busy and less alone, find another outlet for your time and energy. Fill your life with engaging activities. The excitement of doing something different can help replace the urge to masturbate, and you will have a go-to distraction next time when you are tempted.

Develop a routine for food and breast feeding. At this stage, baby needs four meals and three to four times breast feeding. Make an alternate, give breast feeding when she wakes up, after two to three hours give breakfast, like that. If she sleeps for good hours during day time then, you need to make her engage in some play to reduce day time sleep. It will take time, but slowly, she will develop a proper cycle. I am sure things will change."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, My girl baby is 3 years old and weighs 17 kg. She does not eat properly and will not have any alternative food also.

Presently she is having a mild cough, which can be due to a mild sore throat or common cold and she might be vomiting due to this illness. The weight of the child is very good so do not worry.

I had a relationship for six years which was extremely deep, and it broke all of a sudden, and it leads to extreme depression and suicide attempts. After two years, I got recovered and then I started another relationship in which I was very happy. But I was still afraid to love again. I was doubtful whether this guy too will cheat me or I may lose him. I was very happy with him, but now he is always fighting with me and makes reasons for the fight. This literally kills my mental health. I cry a lot and it literally breaks me. So I cannot even talk well to my parents. We are in a long-distance relationship and I love him very much and miss him a lot. As I cannot bear this distance, I cannot tolerate this sadness when he fights. Now I am worried whether he too will leave me. Besides this, another reason for my stress is unemployment. So how can I deal with this?","Doctor":"Hello. I can imagine how difficult it might be. You are having adjustment issues, trust issues on the surface. Secondly, there also might be cognitive distortions that are making you feel vulnerable and having frequent fights. There also might be self-esteem issues that are making you continue the relationships which you are not comfortable in. I would suggest you start counseling therapy session. It is important that you spend some time understanding yourself. To be a part of a happy relationship, first, you have to be happy with yourself.

Doctor prescribed Phexin syrup 5 ml for three days. But at the medical shop, the pharmacist has given Paraxin 120 ml which I did not crosscheck again with the prescription and gave it to my son. His stools are dark green, and he is very cranky. He cries all the time. Is it because of the medicine? I have stopped giving Paraxin. But would it have caused anything else?","Doctor":"Hello. Paraxin contains Chloramphenicol, and it can cause loose motion, vomiting, and abdominal pain. Your baby might be cranky for the same reason. It can lead to other side effects if given in high doses, particularly on blood cell production. Please let me know how many doses you have given? What is the strength of the Syrup? When was the last dose given? As there is no antidote, you need to watch your baby for any change in breathing or change in skin color, abdominal distension, and urination. I suggest to get your baby physically checked, and get the drug level in the blood if it is available over there, else just get blood lactate levels and other blood tests. Accidentally ingestion of wrong medication. CBC (complete blood count), CRP (C-reactive protein), serum elctrolytes, serum lactate. Serum Chloramphenicol Level. Chloramphenicol toxicity.

Do dieters tend to overlook one of the easiest weight-loss techniques i.e. drinking enough water? What is the role of hydration in weight loss? Is taking eight glasses of water necessary and suggest a way to help the people to adopt smart strategies of sipping water throughout the day?","Doctor":"Hello. Hydration is important as the body is made of 60-70 % of water. Intracellular hydration is very important and it is often ignored. It can lead to cell death and takes longer recovery times in long term injuries of tendons and ligaments. Drink enough water to keep your kidney function and urine light amber color. If the urine is darker then it indicates dehydration. So, if you drink six glasses of water and your urine is light amber color it is normal. Even if you drink ten glasses of water and workout in the sun, and if your urine is dark, then you are dehydrated."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, How to help the kids to get sleep and fall back to sleep naturally?

They include reading books, reciting some rhyming poems, discussing the things happened during the day. In addition, try to prepare your bed with children, get them involved in packing or finding their pajamas or bedding sheets or blankets. Try to sing the same song every night, and name it as good night song. If kids repeat the same thing at the same time every day, the result will be astonished.

Is there any way of recovery?","Doctor":"Hello. This depends on the cause. If the cause is ischemic, meaning it has occurred due to blockages and the heart muscle is already dead, then it is unlikely to improve or improve slightly. And if the heart muscle is not dead, then opening the blocked vessel will help in improving heart function. Now, the way to know whether the heart muscle is dead or not is viability assessment with PET (positron emission tomography) scan.  If the cause is non-ischemic with blockages like DCMP (dilated cardiomyopathy), then there is a chance for improvement with medication. So basically, there may be some improvement with medicines, but whether marked improvement would occur or not will depend on the viability of heart muscle, which can be known on further testing with PET scan.

It is hard to tell if this is really a new thing because he has always run hot, but I felt like the sweating might be increasing. Doctor ordered for the bloodwork and everything was normal except a slightly elevated sedimentation rate of 36 and a CRP is 8.5. Doctor asked me whether he was sick when he had the tests done and actually he was sick before four days. He had a fever and sore throat for about a week before and conjunctivitis for about four days before getting his blood work done. The plan is to test him again after a month. I wanted a second opinion as I am worried about the elevated sedimentation rate and CRP. Do you believe it could be easily explained due to being sick a little before the blood work? He also has eczema, could that be the cause for these elevated levels as they are related to inflammation? Are those levels concerning something like cancer? I would love to some reassurance.","Doctor":"Hello. Elevated sedimentation rate of 36 and a CRP of 8.5, looks nonconcerning to me. Not sure, what made you think about cancer. Usually, small kids do catch unknown bugs from their peer groups without throwing many symptoms. It seems he had a recent viral infection which can explain these lab reports. Nowadays we even do not check often these numbers. I am sure your doctor would have checked the kid for any lymph nodes in the neck and axilla. A follow-up lab check after month can be done. Meanwhile, if he is eating, playing well, I am not concerned. Cancer will present with more aggressive symptoms of fever, night sweats, lumps in the body. Usually, kids are more sicker than you are saying in your case. But it is always good to keep a watch for these symptoms. Viral infection, unknown. None.

I would like to know at least one symptom of hyperglycemia, and explanation of why that symptom occurs during a bout of high blood sugar?","Doctor":"Hello. Usually high blood glucose (hyperglycemia) symptoms are not very obvious, hence people do not come to know about the problem easily. So called typical symptoms of diabetes or hyperglycemia are : excess thirst (polydypsia), excess hunger (polyphagia) and excess urination (polyuria) are not easily recognizable. When diabetes begins patients tend to have more thirst, more hunger and more passing of urine specially at night, disturbing the sleep. In addition persons tend to have unexplained weight loss (due loss of excess glucose through urine) and unexplained perpetual tiredness. Our kidneys normally absorb all the glucose filtered, no glucose is excreted in the urine in a normal person. But if blood glucose increases beyond 180 mg/ 100 ml, then the kidneys are unable to retain the same, hence in hyperglycemia all the excess glucose is sent in the urine. In the urinary bladder when more glucose is present due to osmosis it draws more water and patient get repeated urge to pass urine. Excess passage of urine leads to more or increased thirst, hence dryness of mouth. To combat that person tends to drink more water. Loss of glucose indirectly leads to energy loss, tiredness, weight loss, fatigue and even the increased hunger. Prediabetes is a condition when blood glucose levels are above normal but below the diagnostic limit. That is fasting glucose between 101 to 125 mg/ 100 ml and post-prandial glucose between 141 to 199 mg/100 ml and HbA1c% between 5.7 % to 6.4%. Diabetes is diagnosed when fasting glucose is 126 mg/dL and above, post-prandial glucose is 200 mg/dL and above, and HbA1c% is 6.5 % and above. Unfortunately there are no very specific symptoms that can be attributed to hyperglycemia which can be easily recognizable. Hence more that 46% of people with diabetes do not come to know that they have the disease. Most often it is a chance diagnosis. I hope this helps."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I met with a girl a few months back. She had been rubbing her vagina and then put her finger in my backside. She said she was clean but hard to know. After about three months, I got tested for STD panel and came up negative with everything including HSV 2 except for HSV 1, which came up positive. However, the test used was herpeSelect Elisa IgG, which I read is known to have false positives. My score was 3.3. I read if the score is less than 3.5 then it could be a false positive. A week later, I retested using herpeSelect immunoblot, which is supposed to be more accurate and tested negative for HSV 1 and 2. However, for the past three months, I am having itching in my backside, which could be due to sweat and anxiety. Do I have anything to worry about or trust the latest results that I have no herpes and put this to rest?","Doctor":"Hello. 1. The manifestation which you are saying are not of herpes, they normally present as grouped vesicles on an erythematous base. 2. Herpes has an incubation period of five days, it means symptoms would have to develop within five days of infection. 3. Your test are absolutely normal and you do not have to worry about it. 4. If you would have any vesicular eruption which is extremely painful, then you would have chances of herpes, so go for Tzanck smear and DFA (direct fluorescent antibody) test for it. 5. Always indulge yourself in safe sex practice because herpes genitalis caused by HSV 2 (herpes simplex virus) is an incurable condition."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, Why some men cannot grow full beards? Explain why some men are not capable of growing full beards, and can only manage thin, patchy ones. Is this due to testosterone and genetics or something more? How does not being able to grow a full beard potentially impact men psychologically? Can this be emasculating for men or cause issues with self-esteem? Is there anything patchy men can do?","Doctor":"Hi. Some men cannot grow full beards due to low density of hair follicles in beard area in them and that depends on their genes and hormones. The male hormone testosterone is converted to dihydrotestosterone by 5 alpha reductase. Dihydrotestosterone is a potent steroid and is responsible for beard growth and male pattern hair loss at the same time. There are certain conditions that can lead to patchy beard hair loss that is alopecia areata. It is an autoimmune disease and is treatable with topical, oral and intraleisonal steroids. In alopecia areata, men can have their beard grow back. Men who naturally have few beard hairs can be emotionally upset because may be they feel less masculine, it may lead to anxiety, depression, excessive worrisome and impact on psychological health of the person. Others may not bothered about it much. As hormones are responsible for it, it is not a good idea to take hormone supplements only for beard hair growth because it can have other side effects too. However, good oil massage, along with biotin supplements and latest techniques of hair follicle transplant and PRP have good results."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am 61 years old. I have been decompensating by becoming more depressed and anxious. I moved to a new town 5 months ago. My husband is 70 years old and his health is deteriorating. He is having serious symptoms of COPD for which he is getting treatment but I am fearful that he will not get better because it is irreversible. A month ago he was diagnosed with throat cancer. This is the second time I have helped him dealing with emotional and physical side effects. I am on 5 mg of Clonapin twice a week, Neurontin 140 mg, Seroquel 300 mg to sleep, Gabapentin 200 mg as mood stabilizer, and 20 mg of Lexapro. I have been treated for depression and anxiety since I was 14 years old. I was sexually molested at the age of seven and never told anyone. Last year I told my husband. I started drinking at 13 years and weed at 14 years. I had therapy off and on my whole life. I have chronic fatigue syndrome for over a year due to my extreme stress. I have been on SSDI for 10 years for my back problems, anxiety and depression. There are lots more trauma. I have been clean and sober for 22 years.","Doctor":"Hello. I can imagine it would be so difficult for you to handle so much all by yourself. And I can see that your past trauma is still holding a place in your mind and is effecting you negatively. I would suggest to start counseling therapy session, there are so many things pent-up in your mind that they are going to have a negative impact on your health. With the therapist, 1. You will be able to vent out and have a safe place for conversation. 2. The therapist will help you learn coping skills. 3. You will be able to recognize your own negative subconscious thought patterns which are keeping you in the loop of negativity. 4. You can learn some techniques which would help you out with control of anxiety and depression symptoms. If you are not comfortable with that, I would suggest you to at least start some productive habits like journaling, meditation, deep breathing exercises, progressive muscle relaxation, etc., which would make you feel a little better. So, I would suggest you to start counseling sessions as soon as possible. You can find a local therapist or you can start therapy session online in a video consultation with me.

She is 60 years old and complaining of pain in the bones and back specifically lower back and feeling the presence of bone air as if it breaks. She also feels bouts of imbalance, while sitting, standing or even walking. She did an analysis and has a lack of vitamin D. Doctor prescribed vitamin D 50000 units once a week and calcium 300 grams. She also has blood pressure and high cholesterol but has not been prescribed a cure. What is the reason for the imbalance, since it appears at intervals? Do high cholesterol and blood pressure is related to lack of vitamin D?","Doctor":"Hello. Firstly, regarding her back pain, it is probably a spinal problem. Backache may be simply muscular, but considering her age, I would keep spinal cause as a first possibility. In spinal causes, it is probably related to compression of nerves, which would cause pain and may sometimes lead pain traveling into one or both limbs associated with tingling or numbness. So, Vitamin D supplements should be given, but alone is unlikely to help. She will also need an x-ray of spine and physiotherapy. Regarding imbalance, just make sure whether it is imbalance or vertigo. It may be due to neurological causes, internal ear causes, cervical spine causes. Usually, neurological imbalance occurs on activities and unlikely at rest, so I am considering the possibility of either cervical or internal ear causes. So, if she is having any neck pain or tingling numbness sensation in arms, then cervical may be a likely cause or else it is an internal ear problem. So, in my opinion, you should have a neurologist appointment for this. And low vitamin D and hypertension, cholesterol does not have any significant direct relation. They are different issues but should be under control with medicines as they are risk factors for CAD (coronary artery disease). I hope this helps."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am a 16-year-old male. I have tonsils. What is the treatment for it without surgery? Homeopathy is required.","Doctor":"Hello. I am guessing you are having repeated episodes of tonsillitis, where you have been given antibiotics. Maybe your doctor has suggested surgery. There are some effective Homeopathic remedies for tonsillitis. You can take: 1. Baryta Carbonica, 6x dosage, if you have chronic enlargement of your tonsils. 2. Belladonna, 30c dosage, if the tonsils are extremely red and there is a lot of inflammation with fever. 3. Mercurius Vivus, 30c dosage, where there are pus and foul-smelling breath. Try the one that matches your symptoms best. Take a dose every hour of your chosen remedy, and if there is an improvement, give another dose, up to four doses. It would be helpful if you consult a Homeopath in your area, who could look at your tonsils and help you to find the best remedy. For the prevention and treatment of tonsillitis, you can take a naturopathic remedy called Berberis Formula by Genestra, which you can likely order through your local health food store or order online. It prevents and treats bacterial infections. At the first sign of tonsillitis, take two capsules, twice a day until the infection is gone. I use this very successfully with my own children. Or, if you cannot easily access this medicine, you can take Goldenseal tincture, (in drops) as directed on the bottle for seven days. This is easy to find at a health food store. Take vitamin C for your immune system and a multi-vitamin or mineral supplement. Make sure you take a lot of vitamin D, which boosts your immune system. Try to keep your hands always washed well with soap and away from your mouth for prevention. I hope this helps you."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I am a 26 year old male.

I do not get excited during sex and unable to ejaculate. Only, rubbing the tip of the penis gives me excitement. Also, two weeks ago, I have undergone circumcision as my foreskin did not retract.

I am a diabetic and a high BP patient. I have some queries regarding sexual health. 1. I use to masturbate daily as I am habituated to it. Is it harmful? If not how many times in a day I can do so? 2. Will it hamper my sex life? Does it lead to erectile dysfunction or premature ejaculation, etc? 3. Can you suggest me any ayurvedic remedies to increase my sex drive, and to maintain hard erection, and to produce healthy sperms? 4. Actually I feels that for my age, weight, and height the size of my penis is too small. It is two and a half inches in the flaccid stage and almost five inches while erect. Can you please provide me any ayurvedic remedies to enlarge the size of my penis? 5. I have heard about the penile massage for improving its size. If so please suggests any ayurvedic oil for massage. Medicines at present: 1. Obimet SR 1 gm. 2. Glycomet GP 0.5. 3. Ace Revelol 25/2.5 mg. 4. Rozavel 5 mg. I have sent the images of my flaccid penis. Please let me know about its shape and size and provide suggestions to make it better.","Doctor":"Hello. You are definitely in need of a healthy life style. As you have not mentioned whether you are suffering from type 2 diabetes mellitus or type 1 diabetes mellitus. But looking at the medication mentioned by you, I am considering it type 2 diabetes mellitus. Other associated problem like hypertension also suggest me to think of life style associated disorders only. Following are my suggestions for you: 1) Your three problems (diabetes, hypertension, and sexual health) can be sorted out by working on four points. They are: diet, exercise, medication, and stress. Work on these and you will be able to successfully deal with your problem. 2) If you see carefully, you will notice that your doctor is helpful to you only in advising your medication and other things (diet, exercise and stress) need to be tackled by you. So, health is in your hands and not in doctor hands. So, please work on it. 3) For your height, you are overweight. Try to reduce your weight minimum by 10 kg. It will definitely benefit you in all aspects of health including diabetes, hypertension and sexual health. 4) Physical activity is a must. Minimum one hour of walking or jogging or yoga or gym or any other modality of exercise five days a week is recommended. 5) Decrease excess calorie intake. Sweets, fats, junk food, bakery products need to be avoided. Decrease salt intake is must for your hypertension. 6) There is nothing wrong with your penis size. And bigger penis size does not mean that it will result in happier sexual life. 7) Masturbating daily, in general, will not result in any problem as such. There is no standard frequency of masturbation. It depends upon your physical health and wish. It will not result in erectile dysfunction or premature ejaculation. But your other health issues make you prone to such problems. 8) Sexual problems in majority of cases are not real physical problems but are a result of unexplained fear, and insecurity. In my opinion, this is the most important aspect while dealing with sexual issues. Feel free in talking to your doctor on such issues. 9) I do not think that you need any medication for sexual health. Do not be carried away with advertisement. Medicines are not required and will not benefit you. 10) Optimize your blood sugar and blood pressure. Continue with medicines which you mentioned in your query. 11) Come out of unnecessary stress. Fix a healthy routine for yourself by focusing on above mentioned points. I hope this helps."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am experiencing a lot of problems now that I can not sleep at night.

Should we run every type of burn under cold water and for how long? Shall we put butter, milk, toothpaste and/or lavender oil on a burn as people believe these things to be true? Does it depend on the severity of the burn, or is this a terrible idea? If someone's clothes or jewelry are stuck to them after or as a result of the burn, do you take them off or leave them? When is a burn considered serious enough to require either emergency treatment or follow-up medical treatment? What should be done immediately after a burn whether from heat, chemicals or electricity? How long does it take for a burn to heal and how often do they leave a scar? Is sunburn a kind of burn?","Doctor":"Hello. I have gone through all your queries and the answers are: Burns should not be run under cold water. Water with room temperature will be fine. It should be done only for a few minutes until the pain eases for minor burns. Butter, milk or lavender oil are effective and can be used, as most of them are alkaline and alleviate the burning sensation. If someone's cloth or jewelry stuck to them, immediately take off them. Burn involving facial areas or head and neck or genitalia or any burn involving more than 20 percent are serious and should be dealt in an emergency. If burn happens wash with normal saline and apply Silver Sulfadiazine cream. Consult a local doctor immediately. Healing depends on the level of burning, either restricted to epidermis or dermis or subcutaneous tissue. If upper-level epidermis is involved it takes two weeks to heal. Deep involvement will take longer duration to heal and may leave a scar. Sunburn is a first-degree burn in most cases."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am seeking fitness expert insight on nausea after the workout. If someone feels nauseous after a workout, what might that mean and if someone regularly feels nauseous after workouts, what could be causing that? What can someone do before, during and after a workout to prevent nausea? What types of workouts are more likely to cause nausea? Are there any good pre or post-workout snacks that can help with nausea?","Doctor":"Hello.  Feeling sick after a workout is multifactorial overexercising, high intensity, overhydration, or electrolyte imbalance are some of the causes. Regular episodes of nausea could be due to high intensity or overhydration. Keep hydrated but do not take too much water. Maintain salt balance, and take a fatty diet with some salt prior to high-intensity exercise. High intensity, and prolonged exercises like marathon, etc., are more likely to cause nausea. Salty fatty snacks in moderation prior to exercises with help to stave off nausea."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I have multiple small cysts in both ovaries (PCOS). Our family friend suggested me to consume Kalarchikai medicine, powdered mixed with pepper and honey to have it for one mandalam (48 days).

How often these issues occur together? What are the current theories for why they occur together so often? How are they treated when they occur together and are there any medication interactions to keep in mind?","Doctor":"Hello. As far as the connection between acne and mental health conditions such as anxiety and depression is concerned, definitely we as a psychologist come across such cases of young girls who develop an inferiority complex and doubt over their self-image due to the perceived ugliness over their face. It can not be said that this is a sole factor leading to anxiety or depression among young girls, but it can be counted as one of the factors affecting the mental health of women. Currently, no such theoretical lines are developed which indicate a connection of acne and depression or anxiety. However, such research can be planned to see the relationship between the two health conditions i.e. cystic acne and depression or anxiety. Though the literature on self-image and appearance anxiety might provide some clues over the relationship between the two conditions. A doctor may prescribe medication to reduce cystic acne, for improvement of the client's self-image. Counseling can serve the best. You may counsel the patient yourself or can refer to a psychologist for the patient's mental health improvement. I hope this is helpful for you. Do take follow-up if you feel the need. Best Regards."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, What are the diseases that people can get from animals and which diseases can pass from animals to humans? I would like to know a few examples of these types of diseases. How they are transmitted and which animals carry them, etc? Please explain.","Doctor":"Hello. The disease or infection that spread from animal to human is called zoonotic disease. Here are a few examples.

Avian influenza: infection that spread from birds to human by respiratory inhalation route. HIV which spread from monkey to human by sexual relation. Although now it is being spread commonly through human to human. These are few examples of zoonotic disease."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, What is the stigma around mental health? Why it is there? How can people help break the stigma around mental health and what advice do you have for people who want help but stigma is keeping them from getting it?","Doctor":"Hello. Stigma for mental illnesses is as old as civilization itself. Persons having mental illnesses were considered as evil. Mental illnesses were thought to be due to past life sins. A person having any kind of mental illness whether neurotic or psychotic was considered as \\"mental\\" or \\"crazy\\" or \\"lunatic\\". Progressively these all resulted in failure to acknowledge the mental illness and individuals develop thinking that what others would think if they consult a psychiatrist. Stigma is there because of cultural beliefs. Even in western countries, people have hesitation in consulting a psychiatrist. What will others think about me? People will make fun of me if I consult a psychiatrist, psychiatric medicines will make me emotionally numb, I will become dependent on medicines, etc., are the reasons there is a stigma for mental illnesses. Psycho-education is the most important method to break stigma. Awareness in public about mental illnesses, acknowledgment by celebrities that they too suffer mental issues are the factors that can help to break the stigma. Making people believe that mental illnesses are like any other medical illnesses, and these occur because of change in neuro-transmitters also help in reducing stigma."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, Will fasting help with irritable bowel syndrome? Why fasting may help IBS? Why fasting may not help IBS? What is migrating motor complex, and how is it related to fasting with IBS?","Doctor":"Hello. Fasting is not better for IBS (irritable bowel syndrome). Fasting in IBS causes hypoglycemia, and further causes giddiness, so it cannot favor IBS. MMC (mucosal mast cell) is associated with IBS with autonomous dysfunction. Factors that reduce the IBS are stress reduction, avoid masala foods and take regular proper diet. I suggest taking tablet Librax (Chlordiazepoxide and Clidinium bromide) 10 mg two times a day along with Omeprazole for seven days before food. Take curd or yogurt daily to resolve the IBS and do meditation daily for about half an hour."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I would like to know the signs to notice in a baby when he/she is ready for a sippy cup. What are the milestones that a baby needs to meet before they can be ready for a sippy cup? Explain the reason for each milestone or give examples for each milestone and why it is important for a baby to meet these first before trying a sippy cup.","Doctor":"Hello. For sippy cup baby should have developed some gross motor and fine motor milestone. Baby should be able to sit without support so that it reduces the chance of aspirations and better suck swallow coordinations. For fine motor milestone, he/she should able to develop radial and pincer grasp to hold the cup by himself. It should be offered after six months of age because outside milk is easier to digest because of gut maturity. Primitive neonatal reflex like moro and tonic neck reflex will disappear, so he/she can sit and flap. I hope this helps."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, What are the benefits of doing regular yoga?

If you are not planning pregnancy, after intercourse you can simply wipe with dry tissue paper or if you feel sticky wash with water and dry with a tissue paper. On a regular basis, frequent washing and the use of soap should be avoided, as it hampers natural bacteria. Once or twice in a day while bathing, cleaning is enough.

It first started on the lower parts of my legs and looked like ingrown hair or small goose bumps with very tiny white or skin-colored little bumps that do not itch. In the areas where it is more concentrated, it looks more like dermatitis but very small, so it is not very obvious at the first look. I also had areas on my arms. Yesterday, it also started to develop very strongly on my chest area where it itches a bit and also has reddish bumps and it looks like a typical sun allergy. Today, I even see the same rashes developing on my toes and in all the rash has spread all over my body now. Although it is not itching, I feel very uncomfortable because it feels like I have a very rough skin surface. What could this be?","Doctor":"Hello. I have gone through the details of the history of your problem provided to us, as well as the clinical photos. (attachment removed to protect patient identity). As per the history, distribution of lesions and appearance of lesions on the photos appears to be Miliaria Rubra (in layman terms-prickly heat), which has additionally become flared-up due to sweating, sun-exposure and possibly some local applications. To be able to confirm my doubt about this condition, I would need you to answer my small queries: 1) How is the prevalent weather in your city as of now and as per your daily home and office routine, do you think you may have sustained a lot of sun exposure and sweating or high temperatures of late? If yes, then it goes in favor of this possibility. 2) Is it too itchy? Or itches more on sweating? 3) What kind of fabric do you prefer to wear? It is better for you to stick to pure cotton as of now. 4) Has any procedure such as waxing been done recently? Waxing or any temporary hair removal method may also result in such bumps or may exacerbate heat rash. Based on my presumption that we are dealing with a flared-up version of prickly heat, I would like to suggest the following to you: 1) Try to keep yourself in cool, air-conditioned environment. 2) Take frequent baths with cool water and non-medicated soap. Something like Dove soap would be ideal. 3) Prefer wearing pure cotton and loose garments, to prevent the accumulation of sweat. 4) Apply a soothing Lacto calamine based lotion three to four times a day. It will give you a soothing feel and also expedite the resolution of your bumps. 5) Since it has spread to quite an area of the body, you would additionally need anti-itching drugs by mouth. I would suggest you procure and take Cetirizine 10 mg. Take one tablet daily after dinner for 10-15 days. Although drowsiness is seen in very few patients who take cetirizine, beware of its remote possibility. 6) I would also like to recommend the application of a mild steroidal lotion over the affected parts for at least 7-10 days to expedite the resolution of your symptoms. Apply Desowen (Desonide) lotion over the affected parts twice a day for five days followed by once a day for another five days, and then stop.

He is a bright and loving person, but he argues a lot even for petty things like brushing his teeth, if he is asked not to read an 1100 page book in one stretch, or prepare for a test. He will argue to limits. He would lie, distort facts, cheat, would do anything to win an argument. He will think about how to get to his target. He cannot withstand anything against his will. How to deal with him?","Doctor":"Hello. You are describing your son's oppositional behavior in specific contexts when he is asked to do things against his will. Has your son always been like this arguing a lot or did he develop this behavior recently in the teenage years?  Does he argue at school with his teachers and friends? If this behavior started early and pervasive across all situations it may be more entrenched and will take more effort to shift. Sometimes at this age, children tend to struggle with adhering to parental rules and the desire to do things as per their wishes. It is important to help them find the right balance without causing much hostility. Some general strategies can help in these situations. 1) Spend more quality time with your son. Playing together and having fun helps. 2) Talk regularly about his feelings, aspirations and how he is managing things. Teach him gradually that he need not win all the time. Try to reinforce positive values.  3) Discuss about unacceptable behavior like lying and cheating. Try to avoid a blaming stance but make it clear that manipulating behaviour is not welcome. 4) Have realistic expectations that children will not be perfect all the time. All children breach rules and boundaries. Try to ignore petty arguments but be firm and consistent with significant issues. As the saying goes choose your battles wisely.  5) All elders in the family (you, your wife and grandparents) have to be uniform and consistent with rules with your son. If problems persist and affecting your son some emotionally, counseling can be considered."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, What is the biggest pros and cons of the Mediterranean diet?","Doctor":"Hello.

Being pregnant in dreams is to hoping a healthy happy married life in normal ladies or in previous bad obstetrics history it is really major concern who used to try and struggle for normal healthy baby. Similarly who want to be pregnant or those who does not want to be pregnant both can dream of conception but for both categories feeling would be different, in ladies who want to conceive it is dreaming their wish as those who are not prepared for pregnancy or does not want it dreaming conception could be threat as to have proper precautions to avoid it like proper regular intake of Contraceptives to have emergency contraceptive if missed pills or if got symptoms of pregnancy unexpectedly then as anxiety."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, Why we lose flexibility in our 20s and 30s and how to keep it or get it back? 1.

Growth spurts loss of flexibility is due to mismatch in the rate of bone and muscle length growth. Peak fitness is in late teens and early third decades. Ability to squat, touch the tips of fingers on the floor, able to hold hands behind the shoulders, etc., indicate normal flexibility. Yoga, swimming, pilates, etc., are some means of maintaining flexibility. Improved flexibility leads to lower wear and tear of the joints and overall the muscle strength is maintained as the joints are not painful to move. Lack of flexibility comes from the sitting and not taking the joints through the range of movement and in general not being active as well as doing the chores daily."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I have a problem of nose block for the past one month and I suspect this as sinus.

As he is having all signs of pneumonia other than fever. It should be ruled out with a chest x-ray and complete blood count. With the advancement of age, it is common for a person to present without fever or even hypothermia in case of chest infection. The other possibility in your grandfather is of abscess in an abdominal cavity particularly sub phrenic area. It can be detected with the help of abdominal ultrasound and complete blood count. In case if there is associated urinary frequency, urgency or burning of micturation present with all these symptoms then the urinary tract infection should be ruled out.

From the way you have described your symptoms which include recurrent fever, cold, and heavy head with nasal discharge. It is very apparent that you are suffering from chronic sinusitis, and whenever you have acute attacks it leads to the above symptoms. For treatment: 1) During acute episodes when you have fever and cold, at that time you will need a seven days course of antibiotics and decongestants. Take Amoxy-Clav 625 mg (Amoxycillin and Clavulanic acid) one tablet two times a day after food, and Wikoryl (Paracetamol, Phenylephrine, and Levocetirizine) one tablet twice a day. Along with this, you will need Nasivion drops, two drops twice a day for not more than seven days. 2) However, this will be a temporary treatment.

One day I went out and came back with a permanent blackness above my upper lip (not my skin color). It lools like I have a mustache. Please help.","Doctor":"Hello. Well, we would be able to help you the most if you are able to provide us with a clinical photograph of your condition. Based on the brief history you have provided to us, you seem to be suffering from Lip-lick cheilitis induced post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation. In simple words, your habit of licking lips too often in childhood made the skin surrounding the lips (called vermillion border of the lips) too sensitive that it developed red lines and made it vulnerable to sun-induced pigmentation. One episode of having stayed out may have resulted in the tanning of the sensitive lip area resulting in pigmentation. To prevent it from becoming darker, you should immediately start using a broad-spectrum sunscreen with an SPF (sun protection factor) of 40+ at least twice a day, every day, irrespective of your outdoor exposure. I am sure you will be able to procure a sunscreen from the pharmacy. For further details about ideal sun protection, you may read the sun protection information posted on our website. Additionally, use a good moisturizer over the lip and surrounding skin at least twice a day. To reduce the established pigmentation, a mild depigmenting cream may be needed. However, to suggest the ideal depigmenting cream for your condition, I would need to see the photograph of your pigmentation."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I had a transperineal ultrasound-guided prostate biopsy approximately four weeks ago.

Is this a normal experience from a biopsy? Is there any further information you can point me? Blood in the urine has stopped approximately two weeks following the biopsy.","Doctor":"Hello. Anatomically prostate is located just in front of the rectum. The biopsy procedure would have caused some micro trauma with resultant bleeding. So, when a hard stool passes through the rectum, it puts pressure on the rectum thus causing the collected old blood to come out through urethra as brownish blood which dilutes with the urine. As such this is harmless and need not worry about this. However, if you have pain and fever associated with it, you need to consult the urologist. I hope this helps."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I am suffering from bloating since February and from March I am also experiencing severe constipation.

Your previous symptoms are suggestive of irritable bowel syndrome constipation type (IBS-C) provided you have no weight loss, fever, blood in stools, and vomiting.

You appear to be suffering from Haglund deformity, which is otherwise called Achillestendo insertional tendonitis. It happens from overuse and consists of inflammation and swelling of the Achilles insertion. It is not related to your ankle injury earlier. Treatment usually is pain killers, anti-inflammatory, cold compresses, stretching exercises and sometimes use of a small heel in your shoe to relax. Your ankle pain is possibly due to arthritis resulting from the injury. The treatment depends on the age and the severity of the injury. If you are having pain in the front of the ankle, first you need to get an x-ray to study your ankle. Further treatment depends on the radiological findings and the severity of arthritis.

Please help me to gain weight.","Doctor":"Hello. It would be a good idea to have a complete physical checkup with your family doctor to determine if there are any medical reasons for your slight build and to make sure there are not unknown causes. If you feel that you are weak and want to gain weight and build muscle strength, it is important to eat balanced, healthful meals with extra protein and carbohydrates. You should eat three regular meals daily, increasing your portion size. Sources of Protein: 1. Meat or fish if you are not vegetarian. 2. Legumes, such as chickpeas, beans, and lentils. 3. Dairy products such as whole fat cheese, whole milk, yogurt, and ice cream. 4. Protein powder such as whey or rice protein stirred into a smoothie. Carbohydrates: (whole grains are always healthier). 1. Pasta. 2. Rice. 3. Bread. 4. Potatoes. Some people like to take a high-calorie drink like Ensure every day, but I advise my patients not to take this route. It is much better to gain weight from a healthy diet with whole foods. Make sure you also eat plenty of fruits and vegetables for your general health. It would be advisable to do regular exercises such as strength training to build your muscle mass, in addition to walking every day. When I was younger, I also struggled with being too thin. Becoming healthier and following these guidelines is actually what enabled me to be able to gain strength and muscle. If you follow these suggestions, I am sure you will look stronger, and not nearly so thin. It takes time and persistence to make these changes to your body. But it is worth the benefits in terms of how you will feel and look in a few months. I hope this helps."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I have multiple problems with my stomach, it all began two years ago after taking pills which I was allergic to.

You need a spot urine protein test to see whether there is any proteinuria or active sediment in the urine.

As said by you, a cesarean section has been done for you a week ago and during the operation, your BP was on the lower side. I would like to tell you that amount and volume of blood in a mother increases significantly during pregnancy to support the nutritional need of the fetus inside her womb. As during the period of 9 months the body of the mother gets accustomed to these latest changes. During C-section and delivery of the baby a significant amount of blood is lost. The body after 9 months of high volume of the blood again within a few hours is left with the normal volume of blood as some blood is lost during surgery. So, the body will again synthesis blood and will get adapted to the new situation. And, to make all parameters normal it will take about 2 to 3 week's time. You were taken out of the operation theater in low BP state. This means that the condition (low pressure and pulse) is related somewhere to the delivery events only. Try to drink as much fluid as you can. Please get your hemoglobin level checked so that in case it has dropped significantly it can be treated. As of now pressure in the chest, low pulse, headache and palpitations (feeling your heartbeat) all points more towards anemia. As of now, I would advise you complete bed rest for two weeks. Keep a regular record of your blood pressure and pulse. Take as much fluid as possible and eat a nourishing diet. Get a hemogram, TLC (total leukocyte count) and an ECG done. In case anemia is seen, then we can start iron therapy. Do not worry too much unless you feel dizzy or unconscious like feeling.

From the history provided, it seems that your friend is having red and bruised eyes following vomiting. This is probably because of rupture of very small blood vessels in the eyelids during vomiting. This will not require any treatment and it will subside in one or two weeks, as the blood gets reabsorbed. Hence, you need not have to worry about this.

At the same time, it also blocks muscarinic receptors that are presented in the heart, brain, salivary gland, etc., that are considered as side effects. So, a person may get heart palpitations, anxiety, etc., and using the drug in less dose for fewer days are preferred. The high dose can even cause cardiovascular collapse and respiratory depression.

That means about 3500 1 mm holes were made in my neck area (beard) and scalp and formed crusts and healed. Following my transplant (30 hours later), I had a normal white blood count but platelets were very low (60000), after one week my platelets were back to normal. I was also taking a lot of Ibuprofen at the time before my blood work. I have two questions: Can platelets go down because of wound healing? I have read that they have a lifespan of 10 days, is this a possibility or surgery or wound recovery will not produce this? Does taking Ibuprofen before blood work affect the count at all?","Doctor":"Hello. Hereby, I am giving you opinion regarding your case. Platelet has seven to 10 days lifespan but it is produced from megakaryocytes continuously. Surgery or wound healing like in hair transplantation will not reduce platelet count. If following surgery infection occurred than temporary platelet count can be low. In your case, this cause seems most commonly. In few patients, yes Ibuprofen overuse can affect platelet count temporarily. But now your platelet count is within a limit so do not worry. Sometimes, viral infection also can temporarily decrease platelet count. Now no need to do a further investigation as the count is within the limit. Continue taking prescribed medication and shampoo.

Also, I am getting pain during intercourse. I wanted to know the ways to treat this vaginal dryness. I had urine and culture test for UTI.","Doctor":"Hi. Pain can be due to cystitis or recurrence of UTI (urinary tract infection). UTI will not cause vaginal dryness. It indicates inadequate exposure to estrogen (hormone), which can be due to many causes. Regarding dryness and pain during intercourse, it can be reduced by increasing foreplay before intercourse which will increase lubrication. If increasing foreplay alone does not help, then you can use any lubricant to help with pain during intercourse. You can use simple coconut oil as a lubricant too. It should reduce dryness and pain.

When these become excessive along with an increase in LV thickness, then it is considered abnormal.  Now this slightly increased trabeculations is entirely a subjective finding. One may interpret as increased, while the other may think these as normal. So, considering the normal ejection fraction of 70 percent and other normal dimensions, this may be a normal finding.

The bleeding ideally starts after one week and starts with scanty, then the flow increases and then decreases again. This is a normal endometrium shedding pattern after Plan B. You are unlikely to be pregnant now after your periods and bleeding.

Dark color stool is probably due to iron supplement, you may be not noticed it previously or it may be that yesterday she has given more amount of iron supplement. Dark color stool due to blood is unlikely if there is no underlying liver disease or swallowed blood due to any cause. You need to worry if there is fresh blood in the stool. Advice: 1. Stop iron supplement for a few days, because you have never seen dark color stool previously. Persistent dark stool despite no iron supplement is abnormal and requires evaluation. 2. Keep a close watch for fresh blood, if you find it, it is necessary to investigate. 3.

She has diabetes and hypertension. I have an x-ray of her eye. She is currently located abroad and I would love to have a second opinion on what process she should be taking.","Doctor":"Hello. Let me first reassure you, your mother case seems to be not urgent. Judging by the information you gave and the attached O.C.T scan (attachment removed to protect patient identity) you have done: -The left eye seems quite normal. -The right eye has some macular edema. Meaning that there is fluid in the retina that is causing retinal stretching. Also, I can see neurosensory detachment in the retina too, this is probably due to long-standing diabetes. Retinal detachment usually manifests with seeing a bright light and floaters in the visual field as well as a drop of vision. (I will need to know if anything new happened to her vision). In this case, my opinion is: Your ophthalmologist will need to 1. Intravitreal injections of Avastin. This will help absorb the fluid leaking in the retina and causing the stretching. 2. If there is detachment he will need to reposition the retina with a vitrectomy procedure and retinal fixation and implanting temporary silicone. Do not worry this procedure can help maintain vision and maybe fix it for the better. It can be a little bit costly and you have to select an experienced vitreoretinal surgeon. 3.

I did not ejaculate inside or outside the vagina. During the whole process, she did not bleed. She was not having her monthly periods, and to avoid pregnancy she took an i-pill after few hours. But a few hours later while she was urinating she noticed bleeding at the vagina (just like during her period). But her period date is far from now. Is it normal or serious? Please help.","Doctor":"Hello. As for the common assumption that women bleed during first sex, it is a myth. Not all women have bleeding that way. Taking an i-pill was a good idea, but it is important to know that it is 95% effective at its best and can cover only one act of sex and can be used only once in a monthly cycle. The reason for your fiance to have bleeding could be her periods, which came early or due to a urinary infection or due to minor abrasions due to intercourse. In any case, it is better to have a full physical examination by a gynecologist to clarify all of these. I hope this helps."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor,I am just wondering what is abutting and abutment of the nerve root means in a back issue. Please explain.

Then I had checked whether the cysts were dissolved by having an abdomen scan. But still, small multiple follicules have been seen in it with both ovaries enlarged.

As far as small cysts are concerned they are unmatured eggs which failed to induce menstrual cycle previously, as a result, they got collected in the ovary and they will remain in the ovary. Now, you have got your periods you can start trying for conception. But I advise you to do it under the supervision of a nearby gynecologist because egg size is important while conception and that you can know by ovulation study.

I just read your query. You can take probiotics in the following conditions: The most common indication is when you have been suffering from diarrhea because it may cause a disturbance in the normal intestinal environment and also loss of normal gut flora.

I am using Patanjali toothpowder this time and I have done scaling also.","Doctor":"Hello. Using toothpowder is not good for teeth as toothpowder contains a higher amount of abrasives and will abrade your teeth. When teeth get more and more abraded it gets more yellower day by day due to loss of enamel and exposure of dentin, which is more yellowish than enamel. Colgate toothpaste is enough for normal brushing two times a day, along with scaling every six months if possible. Slight yellowish teeth are normal. Do not use mouthwashes and toothpowder and strong toothpaste like Sensodyne or Sensodent."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am a 24-year-old female. I missed my monthly periods for 10 days. Is there any medicine to get periods quickly?","Doctor":"Hello. From the information you have provided, your periods are delayed by 10 days. You have not mentioned whether you are sexually active and pregnancy is a possibility. If that is the case, please do a urine pregnancy test and consult a gynecologist irrespective of the result. If there is no chance of pregnancy, you can wait for another five days safely. If still no periods, we need to find out the reason apart from taking tablets to bring on periods. The reason could be simple stress, thyroid, prolactin hormone disturbances or PCOS (polycystic ovary syndrome). You will need blood tests and scan along with full physical examination by a gynecologist to treat you properly. I hope this helps."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, Eight months before, I felt a small lump around the right side of my anus area, (before I had itching around the anus for several months). Later that lump became larger and painful in a week. I consulted a homeopathic doctor and he gave me medicines (Paeonia off Q, Acid muraticum, Acidum nitricum), I took that medicines, and the lump wound burst in three days. But that wound skin has not dried yet, and it still watery, it also feels itchy sometimes. Besides this issue, for a week I am feeling another small lump on the left side of my anus area, and I feel like sure it would become big and painful like the previous one. So I need your consultation to cure it forever. And these wounds appear externally around my anus.","Doctor":"Hello. It seems you have a perianal abscess. Perianal means around anus and abscess means collection of pus. It can be secondary to chronic itching and excoriation of the skin resulting in abscess formation. It can occur secondary to poor hygiene in and around the anal area. Since the one abscess is already burst, this will allow pus to drain and would heal itself. But the other evolving abscess would burst and lead to pain as you may be experiencing. There was the simple explanation of your problem, sometimes there is a problem with the small or large bowel, a condition is called Crohn's disease, which causes inflammation of the small, large bowel as well as perianal area resulting in an abscess, anal fissure, and fistula. I can recommend you some antibiotics but urge you to see a gastroenterologist in nearby and let be examined by him thoroughly. Or you can send me pictures of the area which is painful and discharging pus, as I can guide you further on this. For now take the following regimen for seven days, and come back to me to inform about improvement in your symptoms. We can then adjust medicine or add others if this does not work. Perianal abscess. Crohn's disease Stool for fecal calprotectin. Complete blood count. Crohn's disease. Perianal abscess. Tablet Metronidazole 400 mg thrice daily for seven days, capsule Cefixime 400 once daily for seven days. Half tub of warm water, add 5 ml of Dettol antiseptic, sit in the tub for 5 minutes three times daily for seven days. Maintain hygiene innthat area, regular removal of area, avoid long sitting on hard surfaces like table, chair or floor. Follow up in one week with tests and inform me about the improvement of symptoms."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am 19 years old. After scaling there is temporary removal of yellowness but after 15 days it becomes yellow again. I want a clean teeth like pearls. I am using Patanjali toothpowder.","Doctor":"Hello. I believe you are referring to scaling only, and not teeth whitening procedure. The scaling procedure only removes debris and calculus from the surface of the tooth and gums. For getting pearl type white teeth, you need to do teeth whitening procedure or bleaching. But still, after some time, the teeth will become more yellowish. You need to do brushing at least two times a day. A little bit of yellow teeth is normal. For permanent white teeth you can do teeth lamineering procedure which is a costly procedure where the front side of the tooth is slightly cut and a pure white ceramic layer is put over it. I hope this helps."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I had some weight gaining powder for gaining weight. After I stopped consuming those powders I started losing weight. Kindly suggest on how to maintain my weight.","Doctor":"Hello. You need to understand a few basic points regarding weight gain or weight loss. 1) Weight gain or weight loss is actually a result of fine balance between calorie intake and calorie consumption. So, if calorie intake is more than your daily needs then you will gain weight and vice versa. 2) Calorie intake should be adjusted according to your requirements which depend upon your daily routine, physical and mental activity level, and also on your physique. 3) The requirement of calories also changes with associated ailments. 4) This all is in accordance with Ayurveda principal of samanya-visesha which in simple language means similar things when added will result in an increase of that particular thing. 5) Protein diet is especially associated with an increase in muscle mass and hence faster increase in weight. 6) Please try to understand what actually that powder is. You have not mentioned the name of the powder. But the most important thing to be taken care of is that sometimes these powders may contain steroids and result in an increase in weight immediately. These are definitely to be avoided because of associated side effects. 7) Generally, these powders are protein powders. And if we talk in terms of Ayurveda, this preparations of Aswagandha, or Satavari, etc., and are good and safe to use. 8) Besides you need to rule out the possibility of any other ailment which can be resulting in weight loss. If that is the scenario, no treatment will give you benefit, unless and until you treat that particular disorder."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, My periods was two weeks late. Since I have irregular periods I was not shocked. I ended up taking an ovulation test that came back saying I was in my peak and hours later I got my period. However, I still went through with my insemination and the next day my period was gone. Is it possible that I could be pregnant?","Doctor":"Hello. The bleeding you have experienced may not be due to your period at all. As your ovulation kit suggested that you are at your peak, it means your ovulation was due at any moment. Many a time during the release of the egg there is bleeding. As the egg is released, the holding follicle ruptures. Sometimes the wall of the follicle is vascular enough to cause mild to moderate bleeding, which is picked up by the tubes and present as vaginal bleeding. It may last from two hours to two days. So, in my opinion, you were probably experiencing ovulation bleeding and the good thing that you went ahead with insemination."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I have hypothyroid for three years, and I am taking Eltroxin 100 mg one tablet daily before two hours to my breakfast. But sometimes I feel pain over and around my thyroid gland. I feel like my neck and vocal throat are squeezed and my voice is dumpy. Please suggest any medicine or treatment for pain and vocal problem.","Doctor":"Hello. Your problem may be or may not be related to the thyroid problem. If your thyroid gland is enlarging it may compress your vocal cords and food pipe and cause your problems like vocal throat squeezed, dumpy voice. In this case, you need to get an ultrasound of your neck. This will confirm your diagnosis. The other possibility is some problem inside your throat like vocal cord nodules, or ulcer, or mass, etc. For this, you need to get upper GI (gastro intestinal tract) endoscopy to know what has happened. I advise first you go for ultrasound of your neck first as it is non-invasive, then revert back to me with the report."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I and my fiancee messed up. Because she did not want penetration so I just asked her to do the hand job and I ejaculated after. I wiped the fluids that was out in my penis, after a few minutes like 2 to 3 minutes. It was her turn to get satisfied so I just let her do what she wanted to do. She sat on me, we both naked. She rubbed her vagina in my penis without touching the head, she was so wet, no penetration happened. After that day she felt guilty that she might get pregnant for that, so she decided to drink Parsely 2 to 3 times a day after a week we had the fun. She drank it almost four days, the purpose to that was she wanted to get early menstruation. It did not work so she tried next week for a ginger tea 3 times a day for 3 days. I think still did not work, tried the Parsely tea again together with the Vitamin c, both three times a day for 7 days, did not work. Until she felt back pain in her lower back and cramping on her lower abdomen too, also when she urinated there were tiny white mucus in her urine. There were days she felt a fluid is getting out of her vagina, seeing her panties it is just a white fluid, thought she will get her menstruation back but no. Still she keeps on drinking the tea and taking the Vitamins hoping for her menstruation to come, everytime she is in pain she does warm compress on her lower abdomen and back hoping to induce her menstruation. Still no menstruation. So is she pregnant? What should we do to get her menstruation back? She is so worried. Or is this another problem?","Doctor":"Hello. Well, in this case I see that her guilt is pushing her to undergo a lot of ordeal. I feel she has contracted a urinary tract infection secondary to vaginal candidiasis which is the cause of flakes in urine and the white discharge per vaginum with lower backache and abdominal ache. If there has been no penetration, unlikely that she is pregnant, only a remote chance that sperm would have travelled from her thighs to the vagina while she was on top. My advise would be do a urine pregnancy test to confirm if there is a pregnancy. If negative, then she can take tablet Medroxyprogesterone acetate 100 mg twice a day for five days and then her menses would resume within 10 days of her last dose of Meprate. For UTI, she can start tablet Fluconazole 300 mg once a week for three weeks along with tablet Norflox-Tinidazole twice a day for seven days, with special care to drink 12 to 15 glasses of water daily. Stop using alternative methods like tea, ginger, etc., they will not help. If the menses not resume, or if the pregnancy test is positive contact me for further advise."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, My baby is 3.5 years old and weighs about 12 kg. She is suffering from frequent cough and she is allergic to cold. What medicine should be given?","Doctor":"Hello. Everyone has an allergy to cold, its severity varies between individuals. If she had recurrent episodes of cough, and it associated with wheezing then, it could be hyper-reactive airway disease. It is common but sometimes it may turn out to asthma, it is more common if there is a family history of similar illness. Anyways, the viral infection is common and some people may have 10-12 times in a year. No need to worry about this. Advice: Best is if you do not give any medicine except Paracetamol if associated with fever. If the cough is interactable then you can use these medicines. 1. Syrup Honitus 5 ml, four times a day. 2. Syrup Coriminic (Phenylephrine HCl and Chlorpheniramine maleate) one tea spoon three times a day. 3. If there is wheezing, then give syrup Asthalin (Salbutamol Sulfate) 5 ml three times a day. 4. If associated with fever, give syrup Paracetamol 5 ml whenever fever occurs. 5. Give fresh food, plenty of water, and tomato soup. Report back if needed, otherwise, it will take three to five days to resolve."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor,I am just wondering what is abutting and abutment of the nerve root means in a back issue.

I had bleeding for a couple of days after having intercourse before three weeks. What could possibly have gone wrong?","Doctor":"Hi, Welcome to iclinq.com. I saw your concern. It is unlikely to be a pregnancy. The cause for the delay could most probably be hormonal. The reason for bleeding could be uterine or ovulatory. Nothing to worry about it. Do you have bleeding every time after sex? If yes, then you need to have in-person gynecologist opinion to look at your cervix for the cause (post-coital bleeding). Anemia, weight gain hypothyroidism, stress, change in food and exersise pattern can affect the cycle length and pattern. I hope this helps. Hormonal. TVS (transvaginal scan) if the post-coital bleeding is recurrent. Delayed cycle (probably hormonal). Just wait for a week, if you do not get your cycles repeat UPT (urine pregnancy test) if negative, take tablet Medroxy progesterone acetate 10 mg (Meparate) once daily at bedtime after food for five days.

Based on what stage of her disease she is in, there are quite a few alternatives available for parkinsonism. The first line of management is obviously the one that the doctor has given to you, Syndopa (a combination of Levodopa and Carbidopa). If this combination is not very effective then, a combination of Levodopa and a Dopamine agonist such as Bromocriptine, or Ropinirole, or Pramiprexole can be given. Even Selegiline, another mode of treatment drug, has showed a lot of efficacy in recent times.

I had blood in my stool for about one month, and now a lump is felt outside of my anus. I need some medication. Please suggest.","Doctor":"Hello. I have gone through your issue. It does not confirm that you have piles but, it could be most probably piles. Is it painful when it bleeds or not painful? Is the blood coated on stools or does it drip down, or blood mixed with stools and mucus? Do you have constipation or hard to pass stools? Was there bleeding after an episode of constipation or passage of hard stools? Is the lump outside the anus painful? Have you been previously diagnosed with piles? The best thing to do is get it examined by a gastroenterologist to confirm the diagnosis. I would suggest you some laxative for some time if you do not have loose stools. It could help to heal. Syrup Looz (Lactulose solution) 30 ml at night before bedtime for two weeks and Anovate cream (anti-haemorrhoidal cream with Beclomethasone Dipropionate) for local application twice a day for ten days.

I have been taking Amoxicillin on time as prescribed, but I stopped taking Ibuprofen after two days because it was causing diarrhea. I feel that the antibiotics did not have any effects on the infections. My main symptom now is that I frequently cough up greenish phlegm often the size of a quarter dollar coin. I do not have fever or chills, and my tongue is white. How dangerous is my situation? Considering antibiotics did not have any effect on the infections, what kind of infection is this? What should I do? Please advise.","Doctor":"Hello. Your doctor has made a diagnosis of pneumonia and has given you antibiotics. Your fever has subsided which means the antibiotics have worked. But since you are having green phlegm we need to find out if you require further antibiotics. For that we need a blood count, and if there is a sign of infection we need to find out which organism is causing the infection, and to which antibiotic it responds. For that we need a sputum or phlegm examination which is called sputum culture. Please get a complete blood count and an x-ray chest done. Also, you can take steam inhalations. The diarrhea was due to Amoxycillin. If your blood count shows infection, then you can get your sputum examined for a gram stain and culture of sputum."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I acquired herpes simplex virus 2 infection two months ago from oral sex.

Herpes infection normally involves either the mouth (manifesting as cold sores), or the genital region, and can include the scrotum, penis, and the anus. It is possible to have it without engaging in anal sex. It is a highly contagious disease, and in the active state it can manifest in the above-mentioned sites and also spread very easily. You should get yourself checked again for both HSV (herpes simplex virus) 1 and 2 to confirm if you have not done it. The good thing is it can be treated. You can do a course of Famciclovir two tablets daily for seven to ten days. Since it can spread through both vaginal and anal intercourse, it is better to get your partner tested too. The more you delay, there are more chances of it turning into a chronic infection."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am a 25-year-old male.

Apart from the body ache are you suffering from some other symptoms like loose stools, vomiting, or nausea? Some time due to vagal irritation of acid in the stomach leads to reflux tachycardia and nothing to be worried, but still, I will advise you to get an ECG (electrocardiogram) done and send it to us.

Tablet Propanolol 20 mg (if required) means if you again get a fast heart beat. This medicine is not for regular use. Avoid spicy food.

Excessive anxiety, panic attacks is a common cause of palpitations. If you had no prior history of anxiety and suddenly developed palpitations, it is advisable to consult a heart specialist (cardiologist) so that any heart related issues can be ruled out. If you have never consulted a cardiologist before, it will also be reassuring for you to see the specialist and take his opinion. If there are no physical health problems, then your symptoms are probably related to excessive anxiety or health anxiety and you can follow up with your psychiatrist for further treatment."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am a 27-year-old virgin female. I got my period five years back and then again 40 days after that and no periods after that. My prolactin was 30.8 and insulin was 10 (within range). My TSH was also normal when I got it tested. Also, I had PCOS. Ultrasound and everything are normal. I have mild hirsutism and I am having acne. My hair is becoming brittle. What should I do?","Doctor":"Hello. I understand your concern. Your prolactin is normal and also it is a good sign that TSH (thyroid-stimulating hormone) is normal. What I did not get from your query though, was whether you have PCOS (polycystic ovary syndrome) or it has been ruled out. Because all your symptoms match more like PCOS. If you do have PCOS, you need to exercise regularly, modify your diet, and if required take Metformin for preventing diabetes. Since most women with PCOS get obese, have very irregular periods and also have hirsutism. If it does not get normal, then hormone replacement therapy has to be considered and also Clomiphene can be given for three to six cycles for regular ovulation. I will advise a gynecologist opinion as soon as possible and I will also request you to send your reports to me."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, My daughter is 10 months old and has a little cross-eyed. Her eyes movements are normal, and so focusing on objects and all behavior seems normal. I was told by our family pediatrician that it is minor and might go away as time passes. Please check the attached photo and let me know your opinion.","Doctor":"Hello. I reviewed the history and saw the photos. (attachment removed to protect patient identity). Squint or crossing of the eyes needs evaluation and treatment. In your daughter's case who is 10 months old, the first thing to be done is differentiating pseudosquint from the squint. Pseudosquint does not require any treatment. If it is true squint it requires evaluation by an eye doctor or preferably by a pediatric ophthalmologist. The tests required are: 1. Refraction to rule out accommodative squint. 2. Visual assessment to rule out amblyopia. The next treatment depends on the type of squint. In refractive or accommodative squint, only glasses are sufficient. In congenital squints, surgery may be required. I would like to advise you that all squints require evaluation by an eye doctor. If the squint is diagnosed, early treatment is very important for correction and proper visual development. Hence, I advise you to consult an eye doctor or pediatric ophthalmologist without any delay for confirmation of diagnosis and treatment accordingly."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I have two yellowish tint flesh colored bumps are connected on my tonsil.

I suffered with bad eczema on my penis when I was a young child and used creams to heal. I do have trouble retracting the skin as it is tight and I am not sexually active. However, I do masturbate usually two to three times a week. I wanted to know the possibilities of what it could be? Should I be worried? Can I treat it myself if it needs treatment? And should I stay away from any sexual activity during this time?","Doctor":"Hello. I read your query and gone through the attached images (attachment removed to protect patient identity). First of all, I like to inform you that from the attached images it does not look like something serious. This is applicable for almost all forms of lumps over the penis. The most common possibility for similar looking lumps includes pearly penile papules and sebaceous cysts. The other possibility is scaring from eczema which you experienced during childhood. The possibility of a sexually transmitted infection-induced lump is out as you are sexually inactive and masturbation carries no risk of sexually transmitted infections. Most of these lesions are likely to go without any intervention or will stay without causing any damage which means there is no need to do anything on your part. However, if you see there is a sudden change in size, pain, pain during erection or ejaculation, any form of discharge or fever, unexpected weight loss consider seeing a doctor without delay. I hope this helps."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, My baby is 6 weeks old. I am not able to breastfeed her properly due to pain in the breasts.

I went to a doctor and he ran a series of tests. Everything came out fine, except mild hepatomegaly and elevated conjugated bilirubin. My bilirubin is elevated consistently for the past three months (total: 1.3-1.4; conjugated: 0.7-0.9). Other liver enzymes are normal. Recently, I have started noticing foamy urine. But, 24-hour urine protein test was normal. I always feel feverish and my body is hot to touch, but I have no fever. Is it related to biliary obstruction? I learnt that pancreatic cancer is one of the leading causes of biliary obstruction.","Doctor":"Hi. I have gone through your laboratory reports (attachments removed to protect patient identity). All values are excellent, except total bilirubin which is at upper normal level which could be due to fatty liver. I would suggest you to avoid fatty and spicy foods as well as avoid alcohol if you are taking. It can also be due to side effect of any medication if you are taking. Rest assured you do not have pancreatic cancer. Because, it presents with obstruction of bile duct, causing elevated alkaline phosphatase which is normal in your case. It also presents with loss of appetite, significant weight loss, nausea, fatigue, and midepigastric pain or back pain. But, if you are doubtful, I would suggest you to carry out CT examination of your pancreas and carry out tumor markers such as CA 19-9 antigen which is positive in pancreatic cancer. Foamy urine is usually associated with protein in the urine, but you do not have protein. Therefore, I suggest that the appearance of your urine may be due to rapid urination with a full bladder. This can cause the appearance of foam. Also, dehydration may be a factor. You do not always feel thirsty when dehydrated. Thirst is a late sign of dehydration. Therefore, initially I suggest you to empty your bladder more frequently if possible and drink plenty of water to ensure good hydration. Feeling hot could be due to high metabolism rate of body. I would suggest you to get thyroid profile test done. As thyroid hormones can alter the basal metabolic rate (BMR) of the body. Drink plenty of fluids and keep yourself hydrated. Drink more water, coconut water and butter milk.

It is very watery and lots of it. There is no blood in stool, maybe has a light green color but overall brown with a bearable stomach cramp on the right side. I am currently taking Iron and Vitamin B12 tablets.","Doctor":"Hello. Likely it is not related to anal sex because it is not a common complication of anal sex and also bacterias will not proliferate so fast to give you diarrhea in the next morning itself. It is likely related to food consumption in last few days. I guess you do not have a fever. You need to have medicines for this, like antibiotics tablet Norflox TZ (Norfloxacin) 400 mg two times a day for five days along with some antacid like tablet Pantoprazole 40 mg or Rabeprazole 20 mg once a day before breakfast for five days. You will also need some probiotics like capsule Vizylac or Sporulac sachet three times a day till diarrhea subsides. For immediate pain relief, you can have antispasmodic like tablet Dicyclomine 20 or Hyoscine 10 mg whenever needed up to three times a day. Have plenty of water and ORS (oral rehydration solution).

Vomiting is a big problem in the first three months. Afterwards, it reduces completely.  Tab Emeset (Ondansetron) is recommended in pregnancy. So, no problem. You can continue it.  Although you have vomiting, you have to eat properly and drink a lot of water in the form of juices or whatever you like because if your water intake is less your body's water content will reduce and less urine is due to drinking less water.  The only treatment is to have breakfast at 8.00 AM and then every three to four hours eat something. This will reduce your vomiting.

I have worked out for 30 years five times a week. Nothing real heavy these days (treadmill three times a week - fast walking). Symptoms started about a month ago with intermittent dull stomach pain and mostly on the left side. It progressed to dull testicle pain - again mostly on the left side. It is usually not stomach and testicle at the same time. There are no noticeable lumps in the testicles - both feel the same to me, but the pain is more on the upper top of the testicle from what I can tell. I believe there are some tubes or cords there naturally and to me, it feels like the left side does feel more cordy (for lack of a better word). I have occasional groin tightness. Symptoms I do not have:Any masses or lumps.No tiredness/fatigue.No bulges anywhere so I do not think it can be a hernia (I do not remember feeling anything).No pain urinating and no blood in urine or feces.No lower back pain but an occasional stab in my mid back (probably referred pain?). My main symptom these days is the dull testicle pain on the left side upper top. Sometimes, I do not have any symptoms at all and almost never when I am working out. But for a month now, I know it is there and it is annoying and the last two days, I feel like the dull pain is slightly greater at times in the left testicle.

Only thing is you should wear proper scrotal support, that is, you get special support for testis apart from underwear.

I have been using Doublebase gel that my GP gave me, but does not seem to be working. What is annoying is that I have noticed very deep wrinkles under my eyes where my skin is mostly dry. Could I get rid of these? I am only 18 and I cannot even look in the mirror or smile because of these lines. I also have allergies and my eyes water and itch a lot usually during the night. I have now tried many creams and oils including coconut oil, cocoa butter, Hydrocortisone, Doublebase gel, E45, baby oil and many more, but none seem to work. I just want answers for these. Hope you can help. Thank you.","Doctor":"Hi. I have read your query in detail and do understand your concern (attachment removed to protect patient identity). 1. You seem to be suffering from atopic dermatitis. 2. The wrinkles you are referring to could be actually Dennie-Morgan folds (folds below the lower eyelid as a result of edema) seen in atopic dermatitis. They will get better with the treatment of your eczema. 1. Along with moisturizing lotions, you should take antihistamines like tablet Hydroxyzine 10 mg twice daily. 2. If it still does not respond, I recommend mid potent steroids like Mometasone instead of Hydrocortisone to my patients. 3. For your watery eyes, artificial tear drops, like ones containing Carboxymethyl cellulose will be beneficial. 1. Use a gentle soapless cleansing lotion for bathing like Cetaphil cleansing lotion. 2. Wear only cotton clothes. Revert back after two weeks to a dermatologist online.--->"},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I have mild tinnitus effect. Continuous multi-frequency unreal sound coming in both ears and sometimes one particular tone become loud (tolerable) and lasts for 5-10 seconds and again goes to same state. I mean I have continuous mild ringing and sometime some tone becomes loud and again reset to same state. Audiogram does not show significant hearing loss. All frequency response falls near to normal, but with ringing effect sometime it gets difficult to recognize checkup tone during test. I can recognize the beep tone to almost all range in test. ENT specialist told to take Ginkgo biloba and told I have to live with it lifetime. Tinnex IV, Tinnex capsule and Tinnex ear spray launched by Lincoln pharma claims to ease or treat tinnitus, the ringing sound.

I was on antidepressants for almost four years, but now not taking any medications. Kindly advice whether I can try Tinnex products. Is there any side effects? Please suggest.","Doctor":"Hi. Yes, tinnitus is a difficult condition to treat. Generally originates from hair cells in inner ear. If all investigations are normal, then various medicines can be tried. Tinnex (Caroverine) or Tinnicar 20 mg twice a day for 15 days followed by 40 mg twice a day can be used for three months. Injections are also effective if oral medications not giving good results. Keep doing breathing exercises and control your sugar if at all you are diabetic. Listen to music for 15 minutes especially at night time such as instrumental music that have a masking effect.

I had given her Colicaid six drops in last 24 hours. She is only on breastfeed. Is it safe for her?","Doctor":"Hi. A baby can pass five to six stools in a day or can pass stool once in two days. Both are normal. Since, baby is on exclusive breastfeed chance of infection is very less. Briefly, your baby is normal. In my opinion, you should give prebiotic like Enterogermina (Bacillus clausii) ampule once a day for three days to increase gut immunity. Mother should breastfeed the child more regularly to prevent dehydration. There is no need to give Colicaid (combination of Simethicone, Dill oil and Fennel oil) drops.

Just touching the penis near the vagina is unlikely to result in pregnancy unless there is a discharge that contains sperms. There are many causes of delayed periods apart from pregnancy like stress, anxiety, thyroid dysfunction, increased prolactin level, obesity, certain medications, and most important PCOS (polycystic ovary syndrome). In your case, you need to do a urine test for pregnancy using Preganews card to exclude pregnancy. If pregnancy is excluded then wait for your period till 14 days beyond your expected periods date.

I assume you are referring to hyper-pigmentation, most often caused by UV rays exposure, and hormonal imbalances. Laser treatment can be very beneficial, but it is expensive. There are natural solutions, which can be quite effective. It is best to try a little bit on an area of skin that is not usually exposed to make sure that it does not cause too much irritation or an allergic reaction. Test it before you apply it to your face or other exposed areas that are pigmented. Here are some suggestions you can try, one at a time: 1. Apply a homemade face mask made with milk and honey, and leave it on the face for 30 minutes, then rinse off with warm water. 2. Lemon is amazing at lightening the skin. Dab it on the skin and leave on for 10 minutes, twice daily, then rinse. If you can find licorice root or a skin cream containing licorice, that is also beneficial to rub on with the lemon. 3. Raw potato is used often, grated and mixed with lemon, apply for 20 minutes twice daily for a month. 4. Mix apple cider vinegar and water in equal portions, apply for two minutes, then rinse.  5. Many skin creams use pure vitamin C for discoloration. Look at your store for a vitamin c serum, you could apply to your skin. 6. Rub vitamin E on your face at night. Natural supplements that you can take to decrease the pigmentation are: 1. Turmeric 500 mg three times a day with food. 2. Vitamin B complex, taken daily with food. You can eat strawberries, cherries and especially pomegranate fruits, which decrease the melanin production which causes pigmentation. Try to stay out of the sun. Wear hats, and sunglasses, and use a good sunscreen with at least 30 SPF (sun protection factor). I hope that helps."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, Will extensor tendon disruption heal on its own? If so, how long will it take? Is it possible for a tendon to swell? If so, does it heal on its own and how long will it take?","Doctor":"Hello,  Welcome to icliniq.com. Complete disruption of tendons needs surgical repair in most locations (Tendoachilles is an exception) to regain function. These tendons tend to spring back and usually do not heal till the edges are brought back and held in place surgically. The ends if not brought back tend to become bulbous and may appear as bulbs at the ends in a failed process to heal. The second part of your question seems to point towards a swollen intact tendon. If this is what you asked then, yes the tendons sometimes thicken in response to injury or inflammatory condition.

I am experiencing the following symptoms: Congested sinuses for about three years. I am on Fluticasone Propionate for this purpose (two sprays, twice a day), swollen tonsils for about one and a half years, tonsilolliths sizing from about 1-2 mm for about one and a half years, consistent sore throat (dry, feels swollen and difficult to swallow) for about four to five months, ear ache (particularly in my left ear) for about four to five months, bad breath for about one to two years. It is getting worse but I do brush and floss regularly. I am consulting the dentist every six months, and have tried mouth wash to resolve the issue, but the problem seems to come from the back of my throat and cannot be resolved. Consulted a doctor about one month ago for these symptoms and she gave Omeprazole 40 mg for nausea and heartburn. She mentioned that I have an eustachian tube dysfunction, which combined with my sinus issue and cause earache. She prescribed Fluticasone Propionate two sprays twice a day. My sore throat and earache have not gone away, I realized that the doctor did not check my throat. Can you please review the picture of my tonsils and let me know the cause of this discomfort?","Doctor":"Hello,  Welcome to icliniq.com. I have read your symptoms in detail and also saw the picture that you have sent. (attachment removed to protect patient identity).  We need to understand that the nose and throat are connected to the ear by eustachian tube. In your case tonsils are enlarged and have deep crypts which cause repeated tonsillolith and bad mouth odor. The congestion in sinuses leads to features of fluid in the ear which leads to pain and sometimes blocked sensation.  My advice is: 1) If tonsillolith has been for long and repeated mouthwash does not take care of them then it is wise to undergo tonsillectomy.  2) As of now, your throat shows congestion as well so you will need a course of antibiotics like tablet Amoxyclav (Amoxycillin and Clavulanic acid) 625 mg twice a day after food for five days. 3) Your ear ache can be explained due to the recurrent sinus and throat infection that you are suffering. Once both are treated, your ear will be cured. Meanwhile, you will need Paracetamol and decongestant combination twice a day, and steam inhalation twice a day. 4) Regarding the sinus issue, Fluticasone spray will be effective if minimal tissue is present. For proper diagnosis, I will need a CT (computed tomography) scan of PNS (paranasal sinus), axial and coronal view. Based on its report it can be decided whether you need any endoscopic sinus surgery for the same. I hope this helps."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am 44 years old. I consumed alcohol (whiskey) last Friday, about 20 ounces over 5 hours. I do not drink often. I had my dinner after taking alcohol. The next day morning I vomited, it was yellow and no food.

I am having an unpleasant odor in my underarms and having mild sweat constantly. Did I permanantly damaged my liver?","Doctor":"Hello. You consumed a lot of alcohol, very close to the toxic level, and hence you have developed alcohol-induced gastritis. You cannot permanently damage your liver by binge drinking once. However, if you keep drinking frequently, you will develop fatty liver which later on will progress to liver cirrhosis. So try to reduce your drink in the future. This recovery will take a few days. I will advise you the following medicines. If you do not get better in two to three days, then you can consult a doctor and he will suggest some tests. 1) Pan 40 (Pantoprazole), one tablet in the morning before breakfast for seven days. 2) Sucralfate syrup 15 ml twice daily after food. 3) Any multivitamin which has B6, and B12 mainly. 4) Syrup Silymarin two teaspoons once daily before sleeping.

If she has only throat pain, without fever, I will advise doing saline water gargling (a pinch of salt in warm water), at least three to four times a day. That will help all the mucus to come out, and help in faster recovery. If she has developed fever with body pain, then it is better to give her Levofloxacin 500 mg once daily for five to seven days, depending on the severity. For fever Paracetamol or Calpol or Dolo 650 can be given after food.

Over the years I have tried all kinds of medicines like Paxel, Topamax, etc. Maxalt and this sort of medicine have not worked. My headaches were pretty well controlled with Cymbalta and Gabapentin twice per day. I went off the Gabapentin three years ago and only experienced 3 to 4 migraines per year.

I have a history of anxiety and panic attacks but I had not suffered any of these in a severe form in over 6 years. I was medication free for many years, up until 2 months ago when I went to see a psychiatrist for possible psychosomatic symptoms, I had chronic abdominal pains with no obvious source discovered after several medical tests. The psychiatrist gave me Gabapentin. She said to take 300 mg every night. I started the medication as she prescribed but after 3 to 4 days I found they were making me too groggy so I started taking 300 mg every three days. Then by the end of last month, went down to 300 mg every 6 to 7 days. I had no side effects except for a bit of nausea/dyspepsia, feeling drowsy and my mind was foggy. Around 2 weeks ago I stopped taking them altogether since my abdominal pain was getting better on its own. But around 8 to 9 days after stopping Gabapentin, I started having these weird symptoms that seemed to have come out of nowhere. Anxiety which has increased to dramatic levels over the last few days, panic sensations on every tiny negative or sad thought, a burning feeling in my throat and nose, horrible heartburn, waves of weakness like an adrenaline rush flowing through my chest, arms and legs. I have strange thoughts, bizarre ideas like mind control and telepathy (which is so uncharacteristic of me), confusion - I cannot get my thoughts together well, cannot remember things. Insomnia, cannot sleep for more than 1 to 2 hours at a time. I feel horrible. There is a bit of stress in my life at the moment but nothing that I would not have normally handled decently well. I also checked my thyroid and my TSH and FT4 are completely normal. It all started suddenly five days ago and since then it has been hell. Things have not gotten any better over these days, at the contrary I am worse. Can this be Gabapentin withdrawal symptoms? Because my doctor told me I can quit it cold turkey since it is not addictive but I am starting to believe it must be. No way I went crazy like this for no reason. I feel like I cannot fully control the way my brain is working and I am overreacting to any slight emotion and turning it into panic. Please help.","Doctor":"Hello. You have clearly described several psychosomatic symptoms. On the core of such symptoms is anxiety. Anxiety can take several forms and can manifest in different ways in different individuals. For some it may be palpitations and breathlessness, for some it might be butterflies in the stomach, frequent micturition, etc. Gabapentin is a good anti-anxiety medication but it can cause day time sedation (which you had). The way you have tapered off Gabapentin suggests that the current symptoms you are experiencing cannot be a withdrawal state. Rather it is anxiety which is manifesting in such a manner. The normal stress you have mentioned may not be normal for you. For a vulnerable individual who has had an anxiety disorder in the past, even mild forms of stress can trigger an anxiety or panic episode. My suggestion would be to take a few medications for at least 6 to 9 months and also practice some breathing exercises and yoga. My suggestion for you would be, tablet Desvenlafaxine 50 mg - 1 tablet at night after food and tablet Clonazepam 1 mg - 1 tablet at night after food. Additionally, you can take tablet Clonazepam 0.25 mg 1 tablet on a SOS basis (that is whenever you have an anxiety attack). The above medications will help with most of your symptoms as well as improve your sleep. The only issue is that Clonazepam should be tapered off in about 4 weeks. It can cause dependence. Take care."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, My father is diagnosed with TB of lungs and the infection spreads to the stomach. He suffered from ascites as well, but the ascites got cured after antibiotic treatment. He is been on TB drugs from the last one month and 20 days but he is not gaining weight. He lost a lot of weight in his first 10 days of treatment, but he has not gained any weight. Before he used to get high fevers and chills for almost a month. But no weight gain and complete bed ridden situation, he can barely walk to the toilet and cannot even sit for some time say 15-20 minutes in a day. He has almost lost all muscle work from his body and we took him to the hospital as well, they did all the tests and said that it is because of TB itself and his condition will improve gradually, but I am worried.","Doctor":"Hello. TB (Tuberculosis) is a chronic disease. He would have had TB for many years but diagnosed recently. So, TB would have caused damage to the body for a long time and that is the reason for his weight loss. Weight gain will be slow and gradual only. But what baffles me is his history of high fever because high fever is very uncommon in TB. Since he had ascites was his liver condition checked? As it can also cause ascites. Also was ascitic fluid analysis done to look for any cancer cells? I also advise getting an HIV test done. It would be very helpful if you could upload all the test reports so that I can help you better. One more issue to consider is resistance to TB medicines. Was any sensitivity test done for TB medicine? I suggest two medicines for him. 1. Syrup Cypon (Cyproheptadine HCl, Tricholine Citrate, and Sorbitol) 10 ml three times a day for one month. 2. Protovic-DF two teaspoons two times a day (mix in a glass of milk) for six months. I hope this helps."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am having dandruff ever since I can remember. Tried many remedies, but nothing seems to work to get rid of the dandruff. Now it has started to appear on my eyebrows and eye lashes. Could you suggest a remedy, test and treatment?","Doctor":"Hello. Dandruff or Seborrheic dermatitis is an important cause of scalp itching and increased hair shedding. Controlling dandruff effectively would control scalp itching too. Since dandruff is bound to recur, therefore rather than using a regular shampoo, people with dandruff should use an antidandruff shampoo to keep dandruff under check. If I was your treating doctor I would have suggested you use an anti-dandruff lotion or shampoo. My choice is 2% Ketoconazole shampoo, thrice weekly or even daily, for two to three weeks. However, sometimes a shampoo alone seems insufficient. In such a case dermatologists choose to prescribe a topical steroid lotion like Mometasone lotion (Elocon lotion), to be applied once daily at night, at the scalp skin and eyebrows as well, for two weeks. For the lashes, you can apply a milder topical steroid Desonide (Desowen cream) once daily at night for seven to ten days. The topical steroid lotion can be stopped once the dandruff is well controlled and thereafter the improvement can be sustained by using an anti- dandruff lotion or shampoo, weekly twice. I hope this helps."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am having a dry cough for more than one week. I tried all the medicines, but still, I have heavy cough. Is there any other way to reduce it?","Doctor":"Hello. Dry cough can be associated with a lot of causes such as LRTI (lower respiratory tract infection), asthma, allergy, etc. If you have associated fever, then I suggest you taking antibiotics Augmentin (Amoxycillin and Clavulanic acid) 650 mg twice daily for five days, after food. If you do not have a fever, I will advise you to take syrup Ascoril (Ambroxyl Hydrochloride) two teaspoons up to three times daily, depending on the severity of the symptoms. You must remember that for any cough syrup, you need to wait for 30 minutes after taking medicine, and you cannot consume any water or have any food in that period. It has to act on the throat. You can also take Claritin (Loratadine) 10 mg one tablet at bedtime for three days. I hope this helps."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I have been taking Lexapro 10 mg for the past five years and recently I have increased the dose to 15 mg.

An increase in antidepressant dosage can potentially cause short term agitation, increased anxiety until your body gets used to the new dosage. Lexapro (escitalopram) is an effective medication to treat anxiety and depression. The usual dose is 10 mg once daily. Sometimes dosage can be increased to 15 mg or 20 mg once daily. Discuss with your psychiatrist whether the increase in Lexapro dosage is needed in your situation. If increase in anxiety does not settle in a week or two, discuss with your psychiatrist about reducing the dose back to 10 mg once daily. You can consider psychological therapy like CBT (cognitive behavioral therapy) for additional support."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I am suffering an erection problem for the last three years. I am married for the last 1 year but I never did satisfaction and natural sex with my wife. My problem is I used to do a lot of masturbation heavy masturbation with oil so it is erect for a while and again loose. One more thing my penis would not get erect or discharged if my wife do handjob and sex, it gets erect only when I touch. I am trying a lot to discharge in my wife's vagina but I could not do so because at the end movement it is going to loose. One more thing I cannot masturbate with my dry hand because I need some oily lubricants to erect my penis. After marriage also I am doing masturbation. Due to heavy masturbation, my penis shrinks and sometimes I forgot things. I am not able to remember anything.","Doctor":"Hello. Anejaculation is a condition where a man cannot discharge semen. It can be absolute when he cannot discharge in any situation and situational when he cannot discharge in certain situations but can discharge in other conditions. If he can ejaculate with masturbation but not with sex then it is a psychological issue. If he cannot ejaculate even with masturbation or in dreams then it is a physical issue for which some tests need to be done. Psychological issue is due to inhibition when a man cannot ejaculate in the presence of another person. It can be overcome by gradual desensitization. He can rub his penis on any body part of the female like buttocks, thighs, breasts, belly, etc, and try to ejaculate. The female can also masturbate him. It is a long drawn process and often frustrating but is useful. He can also self masturbate and on the verge of ejaculation put the head of penis into the vagina. Also vibrators can be used. But before doing all these enough foreplay should be done if needed help of pornography can be taken. Also there are medicine to reduce the anxiety related to it and facilitate ejaculation. For physical problems the treatment is decided after doing some blood tests and ultrasound tests."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, My grandmother is having dizziness, vomiting and headache.

From your history, it is evident that she has picked up an allergy, which is constantly leading her to develop mucus, and hence, her entire chest is getting congested. Ideally, there is only one thing you can do, and that is to change her atmosphere so that she is not exposed to the allergen. May be she can consider wearing a mask while working. Just an advise long term prolonged allergy like that can lead to asthma in the future. I will suggest the following medicine till she recovers. 1) Tablet Montek-LC (a combination of montelukast and levocetirizine) one tablet before she is about to go to work.

First of all, I would like to tell you that a strong family history of heart disease or heart attack does not place you at higher risk at all. So please do not worry about it. Now medically, heart diseases do have some level of genetic inheritance, but nobody can assure you the same about heart attacks. Heart attacks occur due to various causes related to all systems of the body. So inheritance does not play any role here. I can assure you that if you follow a strict diet routine along with 30-45 minutes of exercise or workout a day, including your cardio-exercises, then you will be fine.

He has lost his weight, a lot. Currently, his weight is 46 kg, whereas initially, he is about 65 kg. Also, he has lost much of his appetite. He is weak, as well. So in this situation, is it safe to undergo gallstone laparoscopic surgery? Also, how fast would be the recovery? Can you suggest a diet plan for him?","Doctor":"Hello.

KIndly provide available investigations and RBS (random blood sugar levels) levels, and what medications he is taking, because his sugar level is not controlled. He is having weight loss also, it may be because of diabetes and TB and may have Celiac disease, as we need to rule out celiac disease in this situation.

I can understand your concern. You have proteinuria and hematuria. It can be due to urinary tract infection, but that can be ruled out here since you have not passed any pus cells or epithelial cells. I will recommend you to immediately get a CT KUB (computerized tomography scan of the kidneys, ureters, and bladder) done because you seem to be having an underlying kidney ailment. You also have some hematuria since you are passing RBCs (red blood cells) in the urine. There are diseases such as nephritic syndrome, membranous glomerulonephritis, etc. It can also be due to some immunological disorders. However, we should rule out kidney ailments first. You should also seek a nephrologist opinion once your CT KUB reports are ready.

Can you please guide me on health repercussions because of abortion pills and ECP? Have I done something terrible to my health and what to do if I am pregnant again? Can I get it aborted through medicines again? I will never affect my cycle hereafter.","Doctor":"Hello. Health issues because of abortion pills are that you may continue to bleed for 16 days or so, and also there may be incomplete abortion or some times no effect at all (failure) as you have already experienced. So it is not possible to continue pregnancy also after taking the pills (abortion or ECP) as there will be congenital malformations in the baby. Yes, of course, the cycle date will change every time. ECP is meant for emergencies only and not to be taken after every unprotected sex. If you are pregnant again, I will advise you to get a scan done and rule out any chances of ectopic pregnancy before taking abortion pills at any time. You can take it again if required, but then consult and follow up with the doctor is a must. After you are clear with all issues, I will advise you to take contraceptive pills regularly to avoid all this, and this will regularize your cycles also and nothing to worry."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am a 19-year-old female.

I thought I was having an aneurysm. I get the pain only once in a week or two. They usually were gone within the hour, and I am better with Excedrin Migraine, but sometimes the pain comes back. I do not drink alcohol, caffeine, smoke, or take any medication regularly. The pain does not seem to happen at a particular time of day or during my menstrual cycle. Please help.","Doctor":"Hello. From your symptoms, I feel that you are suffering from Migraine. A migraine is a form of headache which most commonly affects young females. It gets worse when you have stress, lack of sleep, or gets triggered by some particular food or smell. But the problem is, there is no test to confirm Migraine, it is a clinical diagnosis. Also, diagnosis can be confirmed if you respond to Migraine treatment very well. My suggestion is to start your Migraine treatment. You observe for two weeks, if you are finding a good relief, then you shall continue the same medications, and it would confirm Migraine as your diagnosis. But in these two weeks, if there is no improvement, then we shall evaluate for certain other causes like cervical radiculopathy, trigeminal Neuralgia, etc. So start tablet Sibelium (Flunarizine) 10 mg every night after dinner for one month.

We noticed hearing loss from one month. Bera test report shows profound hearing loss, but MRI and Ct are fine. My doctor suggested a cochlear implant. But we want to know if any other alternative is possible like giving steroids?","Doctor":"Hello,  Welcome to icliniq.com. Surviving encephalitis is like getting another life, given its drastic complications. But the risk of developing long term complications often creates problems. Hearing loss occurs in approximately 2-4% following brain infection. It was rightly detected with BERA (brainstem evoked response audiometry). Having profound hearing loss means it is a severe form of hearing loss. Options for the treatment of hearing loss:  1) Treating the underlying condition, if still persisting. (in your case it is already cured). 2) Hearing aids, as many varieties are available. It improves hearing but does not restore hearing to normal. 3) cochlear implants for severe to profound sensory neural hearing loss, or when hearing aids fail. The younger the child at the time of hearing loss, and the delay in diagnosis can affect hearing and communication skills. As your child is above 2 years, and you have identified the problem early enough, the main aim is to develop his communication skills, which can happen with adequate hearing. And good results are achieved with proper treatment. Giving steroids for your child would not solve this problem. Steroids are given during the acute infection process of the disease to prevent some complications from occurring. Your child would require a multidisciplinary approach including pediatrician, audiologist, speech therapist, ENT specialist, and psychologist, or behavior therapist if required. Going for cochlear implant seems to be the better option for your child. Because hearing can affect communication and interaction, it has to be tackled properly with appropriate treatment options. Observe for visual difficulties, because they would depend on the vision for understanding the language until they have good hearing. Cochlear implants are also known to give better vocabulary compared to hearing aids. You can discuss treatment options with a ENT specialist. I hope this helps."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor,I am just wondering what is abutting and abutment of the nerve root means in a back issue. Please explain.

Sucralfate and Aluminum-magnesium antacids can be soothing when applied alone.  Some mouth sores can be treated with a low-powered laser, which relieves pain immediately and prevents sores from returning.

I just found out this week I have vitiligo in my groin area for which the doctor just gave me Protopic and Triamcinolone. Would I be able to use this on the side of my mouth?","Doctor":"Hi. Well, if you have confirmed vitiligo in your groin area (assuming it has been seen and confirmed by a dermatologist), there is a high likelihood that your light colored lesions over the face are representing early stage of vitiligo, called \\"pre-vitiligo\\" to be able to diagnose your condition better, I request you to provide me with the following details:  1. What was the time gap between noticing the white patch over the groins and the patches on the face? 2. What is the level of pigmentation of the facial patches, compared to the groin patches? It would be ideal if you send us a nicely focussed picture of groin as well as facial patch or opt for a video consultation where I could see your lesions in real time and be able to diagnose it with much more confidence. 3. Are the facial patches itchy or become red sometimes?  4. Do you suffer from dandruff - moderate or excessive?  5. Do you have history of atopy which means tendency of developing skin and respiratory allergies to dust, breathing problems or frank asthma, recurring cold and cough, sinusitis, etc.?  The above questions are relevant for the following reasons: If the facial patches are only slightly light-colored, they may be due to either pityriasis alba (a benign condition often seen in people with atopy that is tendency of allergies) or due to seborrheic dermatitis (dandruff induced) which may or may not be itchy. Both these conditions will respond to application of Protopic ointment alone - used twice a day for 2 to 3 weeks.  If it is confirmed to be previtiligo, then these facial patches may evolve into full blown vitiligo patches over the next few days. In that case it is advisable to use both Triamcinolone and Protopic for the facial lesions. The protocol for face will be little different from groin. You should use Triamcinolone on face only once a day and that too for 2 to 3 weeks at most, as it is a Steroidal cream and may cause thinning of facial skin on prolonged use. Protopic may need to be continued over your face as well as groin for at least three months. Additionally, expose your light patches to sun-light, 5 minutes everyday. Sun-exposure expedited repigmentation of vitiligo lesions."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I had a Cortisone shot in my knee, 10 minutes later started to feel seriously dizzy. I cannot walk straight, cannot hear, my eyes felt so heavy, almost passed out, heart palpation.","Doctor":"Hi.  What is your age? Do you suffer from any medical illness other than your knee pain? Cortisone injection is usually given along with Lignocaine - which is a local anesthetic drug. The dosage of Lignocaine depends on your age, weight and presence of other systemic ilnesses. The drugs are injected into the knee joint and usually do not cause any systemic complications. However, sometimes Lignocaine gets absorbed into the systemic circulation and may cause neurological complications like dizziness, heaviness, unsteadiness, etc. Your symptoms appear to be related to this. However, Lignocaine in the circulation is very short acting and these effects usually wear off in a short time without any further long term implications. Kindly let me know if you need anything else."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am a 13-year-old male. I have been recently struggling with sickness, yet, I do not know which one. I have 94° F, sore throat, and it hurts while swallowing. I can not breathe without coughing, and I blink a lot. Please give an opinion about my problem.","Doctor":"Hello. First of all, is your temperature reading correct? You have written 94° F that is very low, and we call such low temperature as Hypothermia. If that is your temperature, you need to keep yourself warm. Drink hot coffee or hot soup. As your other symptoms are concerned, it seems like a throat infection with probable tonsillitis. I advise you do salt water gargling three to four times a day. Also, you can take tablet Aceclofenac 50 mg three times a day and Paracetamol 500 mg three times a day. If your cough is dry, you can take syrup Reswas (Levodropropizine and Chlorpheniramine maleate) 10 ml three times a day, or if it is a wet cough, you can take syrup Tus-Q-X (Ambroxyl Hydrochloride) 10 ml three times a day. If symptoms persist, revert back."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, My 23 years old daughter has been suffering from a blocked nose for the past three months. She took Sinarest and Cefixime antibiotics tablets, and Nasivion S drops. She has only temporary relief from nose block. So, we took a CT scan of PNS (paranasal sinuses) recently. Clinical findings are deviation of nasal septum and sinusitis.I would like to know the best treatment other than surgery.","Doctor":"Hello. Deviation of the nasal septum has only surgical treatment. Sinusitis is an infection of sinuses present in our facial bones. Once it occurs, it can be treated with antibiotics decongestants and anti-inflammatory drugs. The blockage of nasal sinus opening is the most common cause of sinusitis. You can try Jal nethi, which is a procedure in yoga under a trained master, which helps in revealing the blockage. Avoid allergens and taking a head bath with cold water. Dry the hair immediately after the head bath. Precautions during winter will help to prevent the infection."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, For many years now, I have sporadic pressure in my chest area, and since I never want to presume it is not heart-related. I usually get it checked out. I do have anxiety and fibromyalgia, so the most likely cause is stress and muscle strain. My last episode was about two weeks ago and after consulting a cardiologist, who suspected it to be muscle-related, I had a stress echo two days ago to make sure. I am attaching a copy of the report as well as the copy of my last stress test. The current cardiologist told me that the report looks great with a strong heart muscle and no ischemia. Since I tend to over analyze things, I read the report and it mentions a Duke Treadmill score of 2.5 due to ST depression of 1 mm. I have been told that I have a baseline ST depression forever, and it was present back in my last stress test. I asked the cardiologists about it via a message on my portal and the response was that it is nothing to worry about, and it is not diagnostic. Would you agree that there is nothing worrisome?","Doctor":"Hello. I have seen your reports. (attachment removed to protect patient identity). I studied through your test results there is absolutely nothing that indicates any serious abnormality. The slight change recorded is not of much significance. From my experience as a physician I frequently see slight variations in test results that are not indicative of any abnormality. Has there been a change in the way you feel if recent? Did you had any medication in regards to this? Do you have a family history of heart disease? Do you have diabetes or high blood pressure? Any history of stomach ulcer? Do you smoke or drink?"},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am a 29-year-old male and I am diagnosed with Crohn's Disease before 11 years and was taking Immuran 150 mg/day, and diagnosed with Streptococcus after semen culture at the beginning of this year. My main concern is ED and PE but the testosterone level is within the normal range. I want to know whether my problem is urology or neurology?","Doctor":"Hello. You have mentioned ED (erectile dysfunction) and PE (premature ejaculation). No details of medications tried so far. Can you elaborate on this? Testosterone only indicates sexual drive, which you have not mentioned as a problem. So that being normal rules out nothing. There are no tests for ED and PE specifically. History is key. Better to discuss in person. Immunosuppressive medications do not generally cause ED or PE. You have not mentioned any reason or symptoms for checking semen culture. In the absence of any such factors these semen tests can simply be a contaminant. Even if you have prostatitis, it is not likely to cause ED or PE. No need to treat semen culture unless you are symptomatic or in other words it will not help. Have you checked fasting glucose, lipids, and thyroid function? In the absence of any such symptoms this is likely to be psychogenic especially because of age. Please check the blood tests as above. Reassurance, correct the factors if abnormal in the mentioned tests. Need a face to face/audio conversation to understand the issues in more detail."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am having kidney stones. Multiple calculi are seen in both kidneys. These kidney stones are there for the past two years, which were smaller in size and were two, and now the number has further increased. I am currently on himalya tablets, Neeri Syrup. I have attached the lab report for your reference.","Doctor":"Hello. I have seen your report. (attachment removed to protect patient identity).  It is a case of bilateral kidney stones that are non-obstructive. Ultrasound is usually operator dependent, and the findings are not always accurate. Hence you have to undergo NCCT KUB (noncontrast computed tomography for kidney, ureter, and bladder) for definitive diagnosis. If that also gives similar findings, then you can either undergo medical management if the CT suggests stone of uric acid composition or surgical management if the composition of stone is non-uric acid.There are a few surgical options, which can be discussed following NCCT KUB. Please get back to me with NCCT KUB."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor,I am just wondering what is abutting and abutment of the nerve root means in a back issue. Please explain.

Now, you have got your periods you can start trying for conception. But I advise you to do it under the supervision of a nearby gynecologist because egg size is important while conception and that you can know by ovulation study.

I checked my blood pressure today and it was 140/80 mmHg. I was told it was high. Is this normal or high. I am really worried. Please help.","Doctor":"Hello. It is borderline. It is not worrisome. When blood pressure is elevated above 140/90 mmHg. Then it is considered elevated. Such once in a while, elevated blood pressure readings are well accepted. You should monitor your blood pressure three times a day for a week with an electronic blood pressure apparatus. If most of the BP readings are above 140/90 mmHg, then you need to take medicines. If only some readings are elevated, then it is fine. Also, when BP is measured after exertion or in the hospital, then it may be falsely elevated. BP should be measured after a rest of five to ten minutes with arm relaxed. Anyways, you should have a healthy lifestyle like avoiding fatty oily and high-calorie diet and regular exercise, plenty of fruits, etc. I hope this helps you."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am having brown spotting with blood clots, and there is no pain or cramps. I had my periods in the first week of June. I had unprotected intercourse in the first week of October, but my partner did not ejaculate inside me. I again had intercourse (protected) and I had slight bleeding after that. Whenever I have the orgasm I bleed, this never happened before. I have an irregular cycle for one year. My periods come in about three or four months duration. Now it is four months already, and I am experiencing this dark brown spotting instead of my periods. Why is this happening? Please help.","Doctor":"Hello. Considering the fact that your periods have been irregular since long and the interval is three to four months, then for sure, you should be evaluated for causes of oligomenorrhea like PCOD (polycystic ovary disease), hypothyroidism, and hyperprolactinemia.  Also important is to rule out the pregnancy as you have been sexually active. Once ruled out then a per speculum examination can be conducted to rule out cervicitis, or erosions which can cause post-coital bleeding. So a gynecologist examination would be recommended."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor,","Doctor":"Hello. It is not advisable to withhold pain medication while the patient is on multiple antibiotics for the treatment of sepsis. As the patient is suffering from COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease), the use of Hydrocodone is not advisable as it causes respiratory depression in an already compromised patient, but the patient should be prescribed alternative analgesia due to the following reasons. First, it is inhuman to allow suffering due to pain. Secondly, pain itself is a cause to maintain the delirium and prevents recovery from it. Thirdly, the recovery from sepsis can be determined by clinical examination and routine blood count. I agree that Hydrocodone can mask the symptoms but there are other pain medications which is safe and can be used in patients. Even simple iv infusion of Paracetamol can be used for pain relief, and it also works as an anti-inflammatory agent. I hope this helps."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am 23 years old. I usually get my periods in 23 days cycle. I had unprotected intercourse on my 24th day. I took an i-pill within eight hours of intercourse. Should I take a pregnancy test? Am I safe?","Doctor":"Hello. If your periods did not start by 23rd day, and you had intercourse on the 24th day and took an i-pill after eight hours, then, your cycle would be in the secretory phase, and i-pill would initiate bleeding within 72 hours of intake. If you do not get your periods in another one week, it would be advised to do a pregnancy test to confirm pregnancy or not. Secondly, i-pill may have a secondary effect of delayed periods as well. So pregnancy test is advisable after a week. Mostly you should be safe 99%. For further details, please mention your LMP (last menstrual period) and date of i-pill consumption."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, Every once a month at least I get a flare up of diarrhea where I go at least six times a day and nothing seems to settle my stomach. The stool itself has a weird texture, almost sand-like. Most of it float down but some do float up and there is mucus in it. Other symptoms I am experiencing are lethargy, feeling of being full yet hungry, loss of appetite, and dry mouth. Any idea of what this could be?","Doctor":"Hello. Do you have lost some weight since the start of symptoms? Do you have noticed any triggers (diets, stress, change in lifestyle, or drinking alcohol ) before such episodes? Alcohol has a large amount of fermentable carbohydrates which can cause diarrhea, gas, and bloating, often episodes of binge drinking. The common possibilities are that you have one of the above trigger which causes your gastrointestinal (GI) upsets. They can go unrecognized with episodes of symptoms as in your case. The other possibility is endometriosis. Endometrium is the lining of the uterine cavity of the female internal genital tract. In menstruation, the lining sheds causing bleeding and pain. Endometriosis is a condition where endometrial tissue is implanted into gut, and it behaves similarly as one has menstruation on monthly cycles. It causes pain (at times very severe), diarrhea, and even bleeding from the gut. It is important that you notice yourself the temporal (time) relation between the onset of symptoms and onset of menstruation. I want that you should provide me more information, as I can be able to investigate you properly in a specific direction, providing you target management plan which can fit you best. I hope this helps. Cyclical abdominal symptoms. Endometriosis. Celiac disease. Food allergies. Eosinophilic gastroenteritis. Endometriosis. Environmental triggers.

I have a history of a slight disk herniation at L5-S1 with no nerve impingement. I believe this flare-up began two weeks ago when I attended my first chiropractic visit. The pain became so severe, I broke down and went to a different chiropractor for possible help. The pain was so severe that I got nausea, sweat, and almost passed out in the waiting area. The pain was better since yesterday. The new chiropractor thinks my right hip was tilted forward, causing the muscles on the left to get spasm and be in pain. Please help.","Doctor":"Hello. I understand your concern and suggest to do the following. Take analgesics, and muscle relaxants. Apply hot packs, and Diclofenac gel locally where you feel any tenderness. Either lie in bed or stand. Sit for short durations only, less than 20 minutes at a stretch and that too with your back supported. I would advise against any manipulation by your chiropractor till your spasms subside though, you can have massages of the muscles in spasm. If all this fails to help in the next couple of weeks get a repeat MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) if there are new leg symptoms like numbness, weakness, or shooting pain below the knee. I hope this helps."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, My father got struck with a metal brooch in his left eye corner and the eye became red. There is a kind of brown spot at the corner. At the very end of his eye, a bubble is formed. Now, what should I do? I am worried, and it is hurting him a lot. Please help.","Doctor":"Hello. I think the injury to the eye by the metal brooch has caused a collection of blood there. It is known as a hematoma. This is the reason for the brown spot and bubble formation. You should consult an ophthalmologist for an eye checkup to confirm that there are not any pieces of metal lodged in the eye or skin around it. If that is normal, then you need not worry. The doctor will prescribe some pain killers to reduce pain and redness. Everything will be back to normal within a few weeks. But be cautious, and get it checked by an ophthalmologist at the earliest, so as to avoid any potential complications."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am a 60-year-old female, type 2 diabetic. Over the past few months I have become increasingly breathless when walking a short distance even on flat surfaces. Can you please give me some advise?","Doctor":"Hello. This is likely a cardiac issue. There is a possibility of ischemic heart disease. So, you should get your cardiac work-up done. You need to have ECG and echo, and may need further investigations based on the results of these. Diabetics are more prone for ischemic heart disease and may have atypical symptoms like shortness of breath rather than chest pain. Also, examination by local doctor will help to rule out respiratory problems. So, you should visit nearby doctor for these investigations."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I have felt very sad a lot of the time for the past year and a half. This has been accompanied by feeling hopeless, very low self esteem, feeling unloved and like a burden and occasional mild suicidal thoughts (although I would never act on them), being very sensitive to rejection and isolating myself. Before all of this I used to be very hungry in the mornings and now I have zero appetite during the mornings. Lately, I have had barely an appetite at all. Since five months back I am having trouble in sleeping. These feelings of sadness, worthlessness, etc., tend to worsen at night as well. What is wrong with me?","Doctor":"Hi. The negative thoughts which are making you feel this way are due to depression. They are not valid thoughts, they occur due to chemical imbalance in the brain called serotonin. This is how depression works. I would suggest you to meet a psychiatrist as soon as possible and start medications. Also, I would suggest you to start counseling sessions to help you with your negative thought patterns and help you with breaking the cycle of negativity."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I have been under tremendous stress for the past five years and I am worried about my heart. I have been having consistent early warning signs of a heart attack such as shortness of breath, nausea/indigestion, heartburn, pain in my upper abdomen, pain in my neck/jaw and pressure/tightness in my chest. I typically only experience these signs during the week when I am at work and not so much on the weekends when I am home relaxing. I have never been in a situation like this so I figured I would ask you as to how I should treat this? Should I get tests done and if so, what tests?","Doctor":"Hello. Firstly, considering your age, probability of heart disease is low. All these symptoms are probably related to gastritis and reflux disease rather than heart problem. But, symptoms of heart disease and reflux overlap, so I would recommend you get yourself tested. You will need ECG, followed by echo and TMT if necessary based on ECG and echo reports. Stress tend to worsen gastritis and reflux problems which may worsen your symptoms. Since you are having such symptoms frequently and one cannot have such heart attacks frequently, these episodes are unlikely to be cardiac. Also, try to relax yourself with relaxation techniques. Regular exercises also helps to relieve stress. Also, avoid fatty oily and spicy food. Avoid smoking and alcohol, if any. Avoid heavy meals and have some walk after meals rather than resting immediately. Have some antacids like Pantoprazole or Rabeprazole is available with you. Hope this helps you and get back if you have any doubts."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am a 32-year-old male. I am going to motion normally about three times a day immediately after having the food.

Also, can you please advise some medications to clean my digestive system.","Doctor":"Hello. I can understand your concern. First of all, let me clarify the details. Motion once in three days or thrice daily is normal. So, if you do not have any problems like abdominal pain, loose stool, foul-smelling stool, etc., then no need to worry about this.

It started fever 38.5 degrees and 39 degrees measured rectally on the second day treated with Ibuprofen 3.5 ml and Paracetamol (Panadol) 4 ml administrated after 6 hours (almost three days of treatment). The third day, the baby did not have fever at all and on the fourth day a rash appeared on his face, after his ears and on his back mainly, with mild signs on his tummy. Also, in the fourth day she had changes in his stool- kind of yellow with mucus and quite fluid with no fever. Five days later, the blood tests indicated severe neutropenia with 0 neutrophils on a test taken from her finger. As we got very scared, we repeated the test the next day and the result was 0.2 neutrophils so again a very low value. My question is that is it possible that this neutropenia is a consequence of the roseola infantum plus the administration of Paracetamol? The baby is fine now, she is very happy, playing, and eating normal. Also, would it be possible that these indicators can be so low due to the way of taking blood sample? We got it out of her finger, not through the veins. We were given Azithromicin just to be on the safe side, but I would not give her antibiotics if clinically she is well and shows no sign of being unwell.","Doctor":"Hi. The low count may be because of the disease process and less likely the Paracetamol or Ibuprofen. Another reason can also be the way the sample was collected (although I am not very sure about it). Do not worry about it if the child is currently fine. However, I would advise taking a fresh sample of blood from the veins and checking the counts again. If they persistently stay low on three consecutive occasions, I would advise a detailed workup to rule out any genetic disorders in the child."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am currently 12 weeks pregnant. I had my first ultrasound at 9 weeks. Everything went fine. The past few days I have been experiencing sharp pains in my lower abdomen and sometimes in my sides. This pain is just uncomfortable, I would not say it is severe. I have not had any bleeding but I have had white milky discharge. All I have been taking is a parentral Vitamin once a day.","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Hope this is your first pregnancy. From your history, I feel this is just the pain due to streching of uterus. Uterus is just a 7 cm muscular organ, till you reach 40 weeks, baby weight is gradually increasing, thereby streching the uterine muscles which will be painful. This also stretches the muscular and ligaments support to uterus, attached to the bones around. Vaginal white thin discharge is normal due to the progesterone hormones.   As long as you have no bleeding, no other obstetric and medical problems, this is fine. To relax uterus, you can have tablet Duphastone twice daily for a month. This is Progesterone which supports the pregnancy."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I am a male, age is 28 years, normal blood test results.

I agree with you on the fact that these could be withdrawal symptoms. For this reason, I would recommend trying natural ways to relieve your anxiety: Yoga and meditation, recreational sports, going out with friends in the afternoon, taking herbal supplements (Passiflora and Valeriana) in order to improve your situation when the lightheadedness occurs, taking daily Magnesium supplements which can help calm your nervous system and improve your mental health, and reduce maximally coffee or energy drinks intake.

You are motivated and want to work towards a better life but looks like you are troubled by self-doubts and confidence appears to be low at present. You have already taken the important first step in acknowledging the problem and trying to get some advice. You have the drive to succeed in your endeavours. It is natural to feel stressed trying to balance family life with university commitments on a tight budget. Anyone in your position will feel the same. Try to get some support to help you look after your children. Can your husband or grandparents help? Do not feel guilty or think it is wrong about going back to University. You are doing it for better long-term prospects for yourself and your family. Just try to get some practical support. Always spend some quality time with children and have fun daily. Try to exercise atleast 20 minutes daily. It will help you to regain your physical fitness and also improve your confidence and emotional wellbeing.

If suppose that thrombus got dislodged, it may traveled to the brain resulting in ischemic stroke. The possibility is low, as almost all the venous origin embolus are filtered out in the lungs before reaching the brain but in case you have any defect in your heart then, it is quite possible. The other possibility might be any carotid narrowing which lead to the development of an intra-arterial thrombus formation other than thrombus origin in left side of the heart."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am a 47-year-old male.

It can help you in relieving symptoms but do not continue it further without any doctor's advise. I repeat you have to take Methotrexate 7.5 weekly for three weeks, which means total of three tablets only and further continuation will depend upon the result in your case. There are many causes of raise in eosinophil and need detailed evaluation.  1) When did you first detect that your eosinophil count got raised? 2) Are you suffering from some other diseases like skin disease or lung disease also? This raise could be due to worm infestation and I will advise you Albendazole 400 mg with meal weekly once for three weeks and then, repeat the eosinophil count. This is also advisable that you get a stool test done before starting Albendazole. Cardiac opinion: You had CABG (bypass surgery). I want to know whether you had any kind of cardiac problem like chest pain, shortness of breath, palpitation or fainting attack after that. Are you on regular follow up?  You are advised for non-invasive CT (computed tomography) guided angiography. This is not any kind of invasive process, just like a CT scan only."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am 17 years old. My weight is 62 kg and my height is 5'9\\". I workout daily and I want to gain some muscles without supplements like protein powders. I want a muscularity and not fat.","Doctor":"Hello. According to your height, you are slightly underweight. Your IBW (ideal body weight) should be 70 kg and you should consume 70 gm of protein daily. Protein supplements are for people who do not consume enough protein in their diet. 1. You can indulge yourself in weight training exercises, of course, under the supervision of a trainer. You can do a session of chest and shoulder followed by back and biceps on the following day and leg exercises on the third day. 2. Eat plenty of proteins if you are lifting heavy weights or you plan to do high impact workouts. Your 15% of total calories should be from proteins such as meat, eggs, dairy products, and soya protein. 3. Increase your intake of carbohydrates and proteins. Snack before and after your workout preferably protein shakes or granola bars (they are energy dense). I hope this helps."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am 29 years old. My ultrasound scan shows that I am 29 weeks pregnant with single transverse placental localizations is posterior, lower segment and complete, Previa liquor is moderate, fetal heart beat and movement is present. Approximate fetal weight is 1300 gm, BPD is 7.48 cm, F.L. is 5.5 cm, abdominal circumference is 24.4 cm, and intra uterine pregnancy. Is this normal?","Doctor":"Hello. This pregnancy is absolutely going fine till date. But let me tell you one thing that it is a high-risk pregnancy because of the placental localization, which is called Placenta Previa. So you have to be very much cautious during this pregnancy. Do not do heavy strenuous work, do not let anyone do an internal examination for you and no intercourse even. Any time you may have bleeding and report to your doctor immediately. Keep a strict watch on your baby's movements. And the mode of delivery would be a cesarean section as normal delivery is not possible in such cases."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am a 20-year-old male. I am having an itchy, red sore, painful scalp with hair loss. Doctor prescribed me Minoxidil, Multivitamins, and shampoo. I am not using minoxidil because of its side effects. Please help.","Doctor":"Hello. I have seen your attached photograph. (attachment removed to protect patient identity). I hope the following suggestions are able to help you: 1) As of now do not restart Minoxidil as it may end up irritating the scalp further. Of course, you may restart it once the primary issue has settled. Similarly, make sure what kind of shampoo has been suggested to you. I prefer to use a shampoo that has an anti-bacterial, anti-fungal and inflammation-reducing properties. e.g. a shampoo containing Betadine (BETADINE-AD Shampoo). Apply the shampoo gently over the scalp with gentle massage and leave on for three to five minutes, then rinse off with cool water. Do this every day for five days, then alternate days for a week. Then you may resume your normal shampoo. 2) The strongest possibility of your scalp sore is that of a scalp Furuncle, which is a bacterial infection of the scalp roots. For this, take the following medicines (I have mentioned few common trade names of the medicines for your benefit). a) Antibiotic containing Amoxycillin 500 mg and Clavulanic acid 125 mg (625 mg) dose capsules. You need to take one capsule two times a day for five days. Trade names: Capsule Augmentin or Amoclan or Amoxiclav or Clavor. b) Since any antibiotic may cause a little stomach upset, take a probiotic capsule containing Lactobacilli (yogurt bacteria) once a day or you may also take yogurt twice a day. c) Anti-inflammatory medicine to reduce pain and swelling. Take a tablet containing Diclofenac Sodium 50 mg twice a day for three days. Take this tablet after breakfast and after dinner. Trade names: Cataflam or Diclofen or Dicloced or Diclogesic or Volfenac. 3) If symptoms persist, it may be a pointer towards a possible fungal infection, for which you will need a hair root test for KOH (Potassium Hydroxide) 10% to detect the fungus. I hope this helps."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I have dry masturbated for years and it created dry, itchy skin on my penis shaft. I read where coconut oil had soothing qualities for sore skin. So I tried it for four to five times for three days. Some of it got into my urethra. I noticed some minor redness five days ago so I stopped. I have no burning when I urinate. No discharge. The only sex I have had in months was oral and that person is STD free per doctor’s tests in March. I have never had an STD. But it is slightly uncomfortable. I have a doctor's appointment scheduled for a week from now but was curious what my treatment options could be?","Doctor":"Hello. Normally, the tip of urethra is slightly more reddish compared to the rest of the penis head, as the mucosa is thin over there compared to the penis head. It is possible that you have not noticed it or paid attention to it before, and now became more aware due to oil application. Now if you are very sure that it has gone more red after the oil has entered it then also in the absence of other symptoms, you do not need any treatment for it. It would settle on its own, however, we would like to get a urine routine examination just to rule out the possibility of urine infection, which appears unlikely to me. So I think it is not a worrisome issue and you may continue to apply oil or Vaseline to penis shaft carefully. The next course of action should be urine routine examination and treating infection if we find it, which appears unlikely. Also, you should have plenty of water for a few days atleast. If possible, avoid masturbation for a few days to avoid mechanical trauma to it. I hope this helps."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I had both my thyroid glands removed eight years ago, and a small amount was left (in the size of half of my small nail). Since then, I am getting my blood test done every year, which comes back normal. I do not understand this as everybody needs two thyroid glands to work properly, and a small amount of the gland is not enough to do the job. I suffer from tiredness, weight gain, and insomnia over these years.","Doctor":"Hello. It is not the size of the thyroid gland, but it is the function that matters. In most of the thyroid gland removal, the left over gland will start hyper functioning and hence will take over the body function. So, if your blood work is normal means that a small part of the thyroid is working well. Now coming to your problem, it might be due to either calcium or vitamin D deficiency which can happen because of your thyroid removal. I advise you to get serum D3 and calcium levels tested. Revert back with reports. Weight gain could be due to physical inactivity, excess of cholesterol or even diabetes or adrenal problems. I advise you to get serum lipid profile. Serum Cortisol.  FBS (fasting blood sugar), and PPBS (postprandial blood sugar)."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor,I am just wondering what is abutting and abutment of the nerve root means in a back issue. Please explain.

Now, you have got your periods you can start trying for conception. But I advise you to do it under the supervision of a nearby gynecologist because egg size is important while conception and that you can know by ovulation study.

If you are taking this medicine in the morning time, then it is advisable to use it at bed time. 2. Take the plain preparation of Effexor rather than XR, if the sedation problem continues in the morning after taking your medication at bed time. 3. If these two strategies are not effective, then it is advisable to reduce the dose to 37.5 mg a day and wait for four days before you switch back to 75 mg.

I went to my gynecologist and done a lot of blood tests. She also gave me Provera to trigger my period but still, I did not get it. Several blood test results were abnormal. I have a history of blood clots in the family (DVT, PE, Death). The blood tests showed I have multiple Thrombophilias (AT III deficiency, antiphospholipid AB+, low protein S, and lupus anticoagulant). My lab numbers were either extremely low or high. Is it normal for someone to have four blood disorders? What is the treatment for this? Should I be concerned? Also, would this cause me not to have periods? Would it cause extreme fatigue?","Doctor":"Hello,  Welcome to icliniq.com. I have seen your reports. (attachment removed to protect patient identity). You are not having four different blood disorders as shown in your reports but they come under thrombochek panel where there is a defect in coagulation of blood. It is an autoimmune disorder in which there are various infarcts in the system and you have a strong family history as well. You need to be thoroughly investigated for this and treated and I think your doctor is right after this and getting all the tests done. Usually, it affects pregnancy and a major cause of recurrent miscarriages if not treated in time. The reason for extreme fatigue and not having periods may be due to anemia only. However, you should also get thyroid profile done and rule out PCOD (polycystic ovary disease) which is very common in teens. Also, get a hormone profile done. If no periods with progesterones alone then, there is a risk of giving estrogens to you. This is a matter of concern and needs evaluation."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, There are 10-15 ml of blood after I urinate, and I have burning sensation also. This has been going on for a few years now. What medications can assist this? Please advise on the possible diagnosis and treatment of this.","Doctor":"Hello. I want to know about you, your age, and sex. And before we reach to any conclusion I want to tell you something about hematuria (blood in urine). 1) Blood at the beginning of urination (called initial hematuria) typically indicates a lesion in the urethra. 2) Hematuria at the end of urination (called terminal hematuria) often suggests prostatic or bladder cause as I do not know whether you are male or female. 3) Hematuria during the entire urinary cycle (total hematuria) may indicate disease within the ureter or kidney. Here you must have to clarify your gender and if you are a female then it may be related to some bladder cause and painless bleeding after urination may have so many cause right from some urinary bladder stone inside to serious causes. What I need is: 1) Get a complete urine examination done. 2) USG (ultrasonography) of abdomen. Till then I suggest consuming plenty of fluids in the form of lemon water, coconut water, fruit juices, and other liquids in plenty.  Take syrup Alkalizer (urinary antiseptic) two teaspoon full with one cup of water thrice daily. But this is a temporary or conservative treatment as I never misguide my patients. So you are requested to respond back to me with all details as soon as possible followed by your USG (ultra sound) report."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am allergic to Quinolones, Metronidazole, Ibuprofen, Diclofenac, and Aspirin.

What all the special precautions that I have to take to fight Corona?","Doctor":"Hello. It is less likely you would be allergic to Hydroxychloroquine. However, allergy is not the only criteria. A detailed physical examination along with an ECG (electrocardiography) report will have to be done to check if your body can tolerate the medication or no. There is no specific food for immunity. Any home cooked food that is not processed will do. You can drink hot water that is bearable. Important precautions for COVID 19 are: 1. Social distancing. 2. Use of mask whenever outside the house at all times. 3. As soon as you come from outside have a bath and keep clothes for washing without touching anything in the house. 4. Do not touch your face, eyes, ears, or nose when you are outside. 5. Hand hygiene is very very important. Keep your hands clean by rubbing with soap and water whenever you touch anything that is not yours. You can use a hand sanitizer when outside in this regard. 6. If you get any symptoms of fever (100 F or more in the thermometer) with cough or cold, please report to the nearest health facility."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor,I have been having voice trouble since last seven months. I oversang one night, and for about three months after that, it was extremely fatiguing to speak. I had an ENT look at my cords with the mirror right at the beginning, and he said there was minor irritation, but no nodules. The timbre of my voice did not change, no raspiness. No voice teacher or speech-language pathologist had any idea why it was not getting better. Gradually, after about 12 weeks, things went back to about 90 % of normal. Recently, I was at a party and started noticing my voice feeling swollen as I was talking (not that loudly). It has been four days, and my voice still hurts. It feels swollen, and sometimes there is a little mucus on the cords. Again, talking is extremely uncomfortable, with minimal to no change in timbre. I can still sweep the range smoothly. It just hurts. Any idea what is going on? Could I have permanently damaged something? I would like to get a videostroboscopy, but I do not know where to go for it.","Doctor":"Hello. 1. The conclusions from your problems can be a vocal cyst which is not seen through a head mirror, so you can get an endoscopy done after which if not conclusive can go for videostroboscopy which is the ultimate tool. 2. You told you were using Levothyroxine. Are you hypothyroid, proven and on medication? Thyroid problems can show effect on your vocal cords. 3. Are you allergic to dust and pollen? Do you have symptoms like sneezing, watering of eyes and watery discharge of nose? 4. Prilosec is a drug to prevent the vocal cords from the damage of acid being produced from our body, which is a good drug to use. 5. There are few medications like oral steroids which are not OTC drugs, hence can be prescribed only by doctors in your place. 6. I need to get your immunity checked which includes vitamin D , thyroid profile and a blood eosinophil count. Hope we can permanently cure your problem with the above history and investigations."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I am having pain in my hands and wrist and it started a few months ago. It is typically in the morning. I visited a doctor and she did blood tests. The result flagged in my blood tests was anti-Sm/RNP 2.8 and she has referred me to a rheumatologist, who cannot see me for the next two months due to busy schedule. Can you tell me what does it mean?","Doctor":"Hi. Revert back with the answers for the above questions to a rheumatologist online -->"},{"Patient":"Hi doctor,My 10-months-old daughter got a fever. I have been rotating between Tylenol and Motrin every 3 hours or as I feel necessary based on her temperature. Yesterday I did not give her anything for a couple of hours, and the fever spiked to 103.6. I gave her Motrin, and it went back down to 100.7. But I could not seem to get it to go away completely. She also has been having mild diarrhea (2-3 wet watery diapers a day). She also got her first tooth this last weekend and is getting another one. Could this be due to teething? At what point do I need to take her to the ER? How long can I keep up the Motrin and Tylenol?","Doctor":"Hi. Many thanks for your query. Very often we put down these symptoms to teething, but this usually is a viral illness - a viral upper respiratory tract infection URTI. Teething by itself does not cause these symptoms, it is just that it is the same age that they start teething that they get the more viral illness as mother's antibody in the child's blood die down and the child has not yet grown her own antibodies. So it is a coincidence, rather than a cause. Viral illnesses as a general rule start getting better 3-5 days after the onset, though on rare occasions it may take up to 7 days. But we advise seeing the child in the ER/GP Surgery if there is no sign of improvement after three days, so if the child is not better by today, I would probably get her examined by a doctor. Diarrhea may have been caused by the same virus that has caused the URTI; viruses like Adenovirus can often affect the gut and the respiratory tract at the same time. You need to make sure that you give her plenty of fluids and watch her urine output. For viral fever, there is very little to do other than using Tylenol (Paracetamol) and Motrin (Ibuprofen). You cannot use Tylenol more frequently than 6 hourly, but it is very usual for viral temperatures to return before the next Tylenol is due, so we advise to use Motrin at that time. Motrin, however, cannot be repeated before 6-8 hours. Making sure that the doses are right is essential. For an 8.62 kg child, Tylenol should be 120 mg per dose, and Motrin should be 50 mg per dose. Virus. FBC (full blood count), U&Es (urea and electrolytes) and CRP (C-reactive protein). Bacterial illness. Viral URTI. 1. Tylenol 120 mg if the temperature is above 100 F (maximum 6 hourly). 2. Motrin 50 mg if the temperature returns before the next dose of Tylenol is due (maximum 6-8 hourly). 3. Plenty of fluid by mouth. 4. Watch urine output. 5. Attend ER/GP Surgery if no signs of improvement."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor,I am almost completely certain I am a high-functioning sociopath. I have had many people tell me this over the years, looked at dozens of websites and online tests that point towards it, and I have reflected on myself many times and come to the same conclusion. I took an IQ test a few years ago and scored in the 130 range, and since then I have had an extremely inflated ego, to the point of narcissism. I had a severely traumatic series of events in the 6th grade that either made me like this or possibly helped to push it to the surface. I can do nearly anything imaginable and feel no remorse for my actions, lie to anyone without batting an eye, and I also find myself convinced of outlandish things quite frequently. These things may include believing that I can beat anyone in a fight, regardless of size, just because I am who I am and no one will go to the lengths, I will to win. I have stolen hundreds of dollars from a friend before and felt nothing by excitement for my newly found money. I am not scared of what I (think) am, more so just curious. I can provide more details and information if you would like, but I truly just want to know why I am like this. From what I have told you does it seem like I am a sociopath?","Doctor":"Hello. A very interesting portrayal of yourself, I must say. A sociopath might be a judgement, you definitely have signs of cluster B personality traits, anti-social personality disorder. Such people have these characteristics of apathy, higher sense of self, no remorse, etc. But I have to appreciate you because you do have a lot of insight. I do not know what your goal is by sending this query but if you feel the need, I would suggest having a counseling session so you can understand your subconscious thoughts and be able to respond and not react to your situations. You are 19 now, there is a lot of potential in you if you act now and get a grip on your own mind, otherwise it can harm you and others in many ways. Impulse control, generating empathy, regard for others can be learnt and are necessary to have a good life."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I frequently use earbuds due to itching in my ears since many years.

I also have a problem in my throat like throat dryness and irritation in the morning and when I drink cold water. Suggest me treatment for the same.","Doctor":"Hi. The itching in your ear is very suggestive of a fungal infection in the ear canal. This is very common and the main symptom is itching. Impacted ear wax can also create itching along with a fungal infection. Since you use earbuds, you may have impacted wax too. So, I would suggest you use Soliwax ear drops (Paradichlorobenzene, Benzocaine, Chlorbutol, and Turpentine oil) three to five drops at night for five days and use Otek AC ear drops (Lidocaine, Beclometasone, Clotrimazole, and Furosemide) for the fungal infection in the morning (two drops) for five days. Following this, you can go to an ENT specialist who will remove the wax and the fungal debris. Prevent water from entering your ears and keep them dry. Please note that if you have sticky watery or pus-like discharge from your ear or have excessive pain or fever then do not use the drops. The irritation in your throat is probably due to a condition called LPRD (laryngopharyngeal reflux disease)."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor,I am 5 feet and 5 inches, 112 lbs and eat a normal diet.

While burping, I feel acid taste. Frequently, after defecation I feel itching in the sphincter. I am having a hard time if constipation occurs. I am diagnosed with chronic gastritis and pancreas three years ago and was on medication. I am seeking for a cure or for something that will get my health back in balance. Please help.","Doctor":"Hello, Welcome you to icliniq.com. I can imagine how upset you have been since the start of your symptoms. I will try to provide you the best options for your treatment. So far I understand that you have H.pylori induced gastritis. You have taken medications for it, but it turns positive every time you have an endoscopy, the last which was 1.5 years back. You tend to have stomach pain which is worse on fasting plus you feel burping and acidic taste in the mouth. Anal itching, and constipation worsen your itching. So H.pylori infection is common worldwide, with a prevalence of 50% of the world population is infected with this bacteria. H pylori can cause ulcers in stomach and small intestine which is called duodenum. H pylori responds to combination antibiotics for a duration of 10 to 14 days, however, due to excessive use of antibiotics in community, this bug is getting increasingly resistant to these first line antibiotics, hence, use of second line antibiotics are preferred. I will write down the treatment below in a while. Secondly, due to failure of first line antibiotic therapy, the H pylori will remain in the stomach and can cause ulcers, as well as damage to nerve cells within the wall of the stomach and cause slowing of the movement of the stomach, medically termed as gastroparesis or weakness of stomach in common words. So your symptoms may be partly defined by resistant H pylori infection causing ulcer formations particularly in duodenum plus the nerve damage within wall of stomach leading to gastroparesis causing bloating, belching, early fullness of stomach and abdominal discomfort and constipation. I want you to tell me whether your last test for H pylori was positive or negative? If positive then I recommend you to take the following therapy for 14 days. Capsule Pylera (Bismuth Subcit K-Metronidz-Tcn) three capsules daily with a glass of water three hours after meals and at bedtime, capsule Esomeprazole 40 mg once daily half an hour before meals for two weeks, Digestine 40 mg half an hour before meals daily for two weeks. If the test was negative, then I suggest you to test H pylori stool antigen to confirm if the infection is still present. If still negative then do not take capsule Pylera but continue with Esomeprazole and Digestine. The Digestine tablet will help you to improve your stomach movement. Secondly some precaution for gastroparesis try to avoid large volume meals, instead take small frequent meals. Avoid taking fatty meals such as burger, fried things, and large carbohydrate meals like potato and sweets, and soft drinks, which further slows your stomach. Avoid taking a large volume of water while having meals. Your stomach pain occurring when you are fasting for two hours is due to ulcers in duodenum, once your treatment with H pylori is completed plus acid suppressant medication such as Esomeprazole would help you to reduce your pain. I want you to upload your endoscopic reports and ultrasound reports which can help me to assess the extent of damage H pylori has caused to your stomach and duodenum. I hope this helps. Peptic ulcer disease secondary to resistant H pylori. Gastroparesis H pylori induced or idiopathic. Small intestinal bacterial overgrowth. Functional dyspepsia (post prandial distress syndrome). Stool for H pylori antigen to confirm if H pylori is still present. Gastroparesis H pylori induced or idiopathic. Small intestinal bacterial overgrowth. Functional dyspepsia (post prandial distress syndrome). Peptic ulcer disease secondary to resistant H pylori. Follow up in 2 weeks to update about symptoms, as I can reassess and guide you further treatment plan for long term."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, During masturbation I just rub the tip of the penis and not the entire penis. Is it a wrong way of doing? I do not get excited during sex and unable to ejaculate. Only, rubbing the tip of the penis gives me excitement.

Her total bilirubin is fluctuating from 19.5, 14.5, 13.5, 13, 11, again 14 in 12 days. What can be done now?","Doctor":"Hi. Before advising you about the child, I need some information: Bilirubin may fluctuate during the treatment with phototherapy and the level of bilirubin depends on the maturation of the liver. And the rate of production of bilirubin in the child depends on the cause of raised bilirubin. If there is any incompatibility of blood groups between the baby and the mother, the bilirubin may rise in spite of phototherapy. But nothing to worry as the level of bilirubin of 14 is not dangerous around this day of life in case of babies with normal birth weight. It can be managed by phototherapy and adequate feeding of the child with breastfeeds to maintain hydration, which in turn lowers bilirubin. In spite of phototherapy, if the bilirubin is increasing, then the child needs further investigations to look for other causes such as hemolysis, hypothyroidism, and other problems. If the fluctuations persist, consult a paediatrician online -->"},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I am 26 years old. I had an abortion 6 months ago using the suction method. Since then, my period has been very light and lasts only a day. I had an abortion earlier too using the same method and did not experience anything as such. What could be the problem? What do you advise for this?","Doctor":"Hi. I understand your concern. The symptoms you described indicate that it is due to either estrogen deficiency or a condition called Asherman's syndrome (adhesion or fibrosis of the endometrium after dilation and curettage). Though this is uncommon after an abortion by suction method, it is usually seen when abortions are done with metal instruments and done very vigorously. This results in adhesions in the inner uterine lining which result in less blood flow during the period. The other possible reason is decreased estrogen production in your body. This could be either due to stress or mental anxiety. Try a hysteroscopy to diagnose Asherman's syndrome. It will not be diagnosed with an ultrasound.

So can you give some medicines which taste like a slate pencil?","Doctor":"Hi. First, child eating slate pencils and rice is an indication of severe anemia. Tell your parents to get tested for hemoglobin and start on the iron supplement which increases iron levels and blood levels and reduces craving for these rice and slate pencils. Second, the iron supplement should be taken for three months, as the first one and a half month is needed for restoring reserves and the next one and a half month for restoring hb levels.

I went to the doctor to get a rapid strep test, but it came back negative. I then got a throat culture done, which I have not received. I have white furry looking stuff behind my tonsils. My throat was sore for three days, and my body ached everywhere. I think my last hope is tonsillitis or mononucleosis. I have attached few pictures of my throat.","Doctor":"Hello. I went through your post and images (attachment removed to protect patient identity). You have a short history of sore throat and muscle pain, and your images show exudative pharyngitis. The most common reason is a viral infection, which will explain the sore throat and myalgias. Infectious mononucleosis is less likely because it is associated with cervical lymphadenopathy and other symptoms like pain in the right hypochondrium due to enlarged spleen. I think you have an influenza viral infection, and it will settle in a week to 10 days. There is no reason to worry.

However, recently as advised by a psychiatrist, she started taking Qutipin 100 mg and stopped Licab XL. Now she is taking Licab XL along with Qutipin 100 mg, as she was exhibiting nonsensical talk and behavior. But now with Licab XL and Qutipin, she is exhibiting violent behavior like shouting at people for no reason and nonsensical talk. I need suggestions if taking both Qutipin and Licab XL is advised? Thank you. Any other solution is also welcome.","Doctor":"Hello. I read your query and understand your concerns. There is no harm in taking both Lithium (Licab XL) and Quetiapine (Quitipin), as they are commonly used treatment for bipolar depression and can be used at the same time. In fact, I have at least 15 to 20 patients with the same combination and do not find any difficulty in form of increased aggression. I also like to inform you that your grandmother suffers from some other disorder, rather than pure depression as the current treatment is rarely used in pure case of depression. It is possible that she suffers from bipolar disorder. Regarding further management, I do not think I am in a position to advise you the next course of action. It will be appropriate to see her doctor again. In case you need a second opinion you may approach me. I will be glad to assist you.

As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses.
