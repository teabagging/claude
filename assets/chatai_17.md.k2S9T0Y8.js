I was drunk that day but I did not even ejaculate. Since I had a doubt, I took a test on 4th week, HIV 1 and 2 antibody rapid tests from laboratory which was non-reactive. On 6th week, HIV 1 and 2 rapid tests was non-reactive. On 53rd day, I had HIV 1 and 2 antibody plus p24 combo. The result was non-reactive. On the same day, I had HIV 1 and 2 rapid test ICT methods and the result was non-reactive and I repeated the same test on 59th day and the result was the same. Please advice that the mentioned tests are conclusive or should I go for further test? I took VDRL test also in 4th week and it was negative. I have started getting red spot like rashes on my body from 8th week of exposure and today I found white sore on my tongue. What test should I opt for STI and HIV to be sure? Do ARS symptoms start at 8th week? Can fourth-generation combo test on 53rd day be taken as good news for being HIV negative? Please confirm it.","Doctor":"Hi. I can understand your concern. You have gone for antibody testing for HIV 1 and 2 many times and it has come negative. When two tests for antibody detection based on different principles are negative, it means individual is not having HIV infection. You have also undergone p24 antigen detection on 53rd day and it is also negative. This test detects HIV antigen and is useful during the window period when the patient is asymptomatic but viral antigen load is high. Negativity of this tests also goes in favor that you have not acquired HIV infection. Since the antibodies are usually produced between 6 and 12 weeks, I would recommend you to repeat ELISA test (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay) for HIV 1 and 2 at 12 weeks again. To be absolutely sure, you can go for virus culture which is undertaken only in specialized laboratories or polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test. But, it is quite expensive. ARS (Acute retroviral syndrome) symptoms usually start after 2-4 weeks of initial exposure and your rashes and sore tongue might be due to some other reason. Yes, it is definitely good news that your fourth generation combo tests is negative and since all tests are negative it is quite conclusive that you are HIV negative.

I have experienced sinusitis last year, I felt pressure behind my left eyes and it went away after 4 days. Then I noticed my left ear is slightly blocked and slight post nasal drip, I went to a ENT specialist at my vacation destination and was given Amoxicillin for 3 days, and later Augmentin and Amoxicillin for 5 days. I felt my ear was getting better but it did not fully recover. Back in my country, it is dificult to see a specialist so I finally went to onenext month. Eardrum normal, hearing test came back normal and I was given Nasonex and Loratadine and was told to give it sometime and wait for the next appointment. I went to another specialist and was given another course of antibiotics and oxy-nase for 2 weeks and was told to do the exercise of pinching my nose and swallow. Due to covid19 I am unable to visit the doctor again. Recently I found out if I lay on my left side for a period of time my left ear will feel more blocked and a slight hearing loss, it goes away 5 to 10 mins after I sit upright. When I am bloated in the morning after waking up, my swollen left eye would go away slower than my right eye. What is wrong with me?","Doctor":"Hi. I can understand your concern, happy that you could connect over here, in times of outbreak when going outside will not be safe. I have read your query and you have mentioned everything so clearly. Now coming to the point of your query, the symptoms you are experiencing is due to middle ear infection, one thing I would still need to know that if the doctor had a look inside your ear and told there was no rupture of tympanic membrane, if not, then this can be purely middle ear infection and may take some time to subside. Other reasons can be sinusitis, wax impact, which can take longer time to recover. Although clogged ear can be annoying, here are some tips that can help alleviate the symptoms. Continue to do Valsalva maneuver, inhale steam, take OTC medicine as advised by your doctor. Do not use earplugs, earbuds, avoid any kind of water going to ears. Resting or sleeping sitting up rather than lying down can help fluid in your ear drain. This could ease pressure and pain in your middle ear. Prop yourself up in bed with a stack of pillows, or sleep in an armchair that leans back a bit. If all of the above things are helping alleviate the symptoms, then I would not worry and only give time for sinusitis to resolve.

How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method.

Spotting in between cycles, when you are regularly taking birth control pills means that, the endometrium or the inner lining of the uterus is not being fully supported by the hormones. If you are not punctual on taking pills or had vomited immediately after taking the pill, then that will be the problem, so you have to make it a point to take the pill regularly, preferably at the same time every day. If you are taking low dose pills, then the dose is insufficient, so you have to switch to the higher dose pills. Component of Ethinyl estradiol in the pill of 30 mcg is a high dose and good for these spotting instead of the 20 mcg pills. If you have been putting up weight recently. Hormones may be insufficient for that new weight. I hope pregnancy had been ruled out before starting the pills and local factors like polyps or fibroids projecting into the uterine cavity have been ruled out by ultrasound scans of the pelvis. Local factors like spotting or discharge from the cervix, especially after sex need a local examination and treatment. If all possibilities have been ruled out, then just give support of tablet Estradiol valerate 2 mg (Progynova) two tablets a day until the day of periods. This will support the lining and spotting will stop in a day or two."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, My baby is just 32 days old. He is having some cough and cold symptoms.

I spoke to a doctor of general medicine today for my rabies anxiety. The incidents were as follows. Four years ago, a German shepherd of my friend's scratched my hand. The dog died one and a half years after he bit me. I was scared but calmed down a bit as a dog cannot live very long. Eight months ago, some stray pups tried to climb onto my leg. Their claws poked me but I did not receive any scratch. So, the doctor told me that rabies symptoms appear in three to eight weeks and since it has been eight months, there is no need to worry. He prescribed me a pre-exposure prophylaxis just for my peace of mind and future protection. He said that if I got bitten in the future, then I do not need to have extra doses of post-exposure prophylaxis. Today, I got day-0 shot of Vaxirab.My questions are: If there was no history of rabies or rabid dog in our locality, is there any chance of those pups getting infected? Some pups died, but some are still alive. What are my chances of getting rabies? Is it really that rabies symptoms occur in three to eight weeks? Are German shepherds aggressive by nature?

Does the child have any potential for deformity, low IQ, mental illness, anemia or any kind of physical problem or will the child be healthy? If I get married to someone who is A negative and if the child is A positive, then I have heard that there is potential for problems, for both child and the mother during gestation.

I suffer from depression and anxiety.","Doctor":"Hi, Welcome to the icliniq.com. Your main complaint is pain and fatigue with some gastric issue. Let me know you that excess stress with anxiety can lead to chest pain as well as gastric ulcer. For gastric issue, Pantoprazole tablet can be prescribed for two weeks. If gas excessive then Simethicon containing tablet or syrup can be taken. For stress try to solve problems leading to stress. If exams were not good, you can read well now and can make goals for better reading. Yoga, meditation, and exercise will be having great effect in reducing stress. If panic attacks comes frequently than Fluoxetine like SSRI (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors) group of drug can be started after doctor consultation. If needed for anxiety issue you can consult a psychiatrist. Here, I do not think you are having any heart problem. If pain is increasing in severity then investigate with EKG (electrocardiography).

How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

Gastroenterologist will definitely see the epiglottis but it is not the pathology. The regurgitation of swallow can be seen only on swallow studies that tell functional problems.

Pregnancy is a state where a woman needs high quality nutrition to ensure development of a healthy baby. It is very important to include green leafy vegetables such as spinach and dill, to improve health and prevent any deficiencies in blood. It would be great if you can include a raw vegetable salad as a mini meal everyday. I usually advise pregnant women to take at least three different fruits everyday. Some fruits like papaya need to be avoided. You can include one serving of protein powder with milk once a day. In addition to healthy food, also take iron and folic acid supplements, calcium and vitamin supplements if necessary as per the doctor's advice. Also, it is very important for a pregnant woman to sleep 8 hours a day. This can be divided as 7.5 hours sleep at night and then a half hour nap after lunch (with a minimum gap of half an hour after food intake). It is very good for pregnant women to go on a half an hour moderate paced walk everyday.

Is it safe to have intercourse now? Is there anything that needs to take care of? We have not had intercourse in the last three months as we were not together. Kindly advise.","Doctor":"Hi. After the 12 weeks of pregnancy, the placenta has formed, and the bond between mother and baby is strong enough to prevent any problem to the baby. The only issue is the infection in semen. It is valid throughout pregnancy. Semen is a body secretion and will have some bacteria. When you have penetrative sex, sperm can reach up to the cervical canal. It may make the uterus slightly irritable. So, there is a risk of mild bleeding from the uterus and also a risk of abortion. The physical movements and jerky effects on the body and uterus are fine, even the presence of penis inside the vagina is fine, but semen can cause problems sometimes. But, many years ago, having sex during pregnancy was used as a method to induce labor pains. You can have sex using condoms; it is safe. After sex, advise your wife to pass urine and wash well, just to avoid any infection in bladder and vagina. She has to be well hydrated, so let her have a lot of water.

She had a seizure on the day before yesterday. She had got it for the first time during the gestation of her second child 18 years ago. She is using Tegretol 200 mg but not regularly. She has a history of high bp, but since two weeks it is normal (120/80 mmHg). On doing an MRI scan, the reports showed right maxillary and bilateral ethmoid sinusitis. Is this sinusitis related to seizures? During the seizures, she gets froth from the mouth and tongue bite. For the first few seconds of seizure, she is conscious, but later she is not able to hear and later on she is good. Sometimes, she says that she forgot things and is not able to sleep properly. Since the past five days, she is snoring during sleep. Does this cause any complication in the brain? Is this dangerous?","Doctor":"Hello. She is having epilepsy which has recurred due to irregular sleep, stress and irregular treatment. The sinusitis is not related to the seizures. Her snoring while sleeping does not produce any complications in her brain. Her memory problems may be predominantly attentional deficits rather than memory loss per se. Regular treatment will keep her seizure-free and there is certainly nothing else to worry about.

There is a pain some days and other days there is no pain at all. There is no bleeding either. Recently, I visited an ENT specialist. He referred me to a dentist. The dentist advised me to remove the upper third molar as there was no place for it to grow which impacted and had caused this. When I enquired about the healing time of these patches, the dentist told that they would not heal unless the wisdom teeth are removed. Is it some kind of oral cancer? I am a non-smoker and a non-drinker. I have never chewed tobacco. This lesion has been there for about 45 days. This lesion is on both the sides of my gums near the wisdom teeth. There is no history of a toothbrush trauma too. But, there might be a chance of cheek biting at the same position. Are there any medications available for this condition?","Doctor":"Hello.

On my lower left, I have a dry socket, which I am getting treated for via packing (at least I think that is what it is called). On the right side, healing is just fine, however, I noticed some white stuff lodged in the gum. I am not sure if it is food or scar tissue because when I tried to get it out with a toothpick, it did not come out very easily, so I left it alone. Is this food or scar tissue? It is mildly bothersome. I brush my teeth but know to be careful around the surgical sites so they do not get irritated. It seems like a lot of plaque builds up back there because of this, and I am not quite sure what to do. Also, there is a very small spot of red gums on the front side of my second molar. I put a bit of mouthwash on it with a toothpick and left it alone. I have two questions, what is the whitish stuff that feels like food trapped in my healing gum socket? And what is this small patch of irritated gum on my second molar? Any help is appreciated. I am currently on Celexa (for depression), 600 mg of Ibuprofen (for wisdom tooth pain).","Doctor":"Hi. As it is just one week of wisdom teeth extraction, the white stuff seems to be most probably healing tissue only. It is a normal appearance of healing tissue post-extraction. A white patch of irritated gum can be due to injury or ulceration that can be due to accidental injury with the extraction instrument or can be due to injury with a toothbrush or any hard food. You can apply Chlorhexidine gel over it. Do warm saline gargles, antiseptic mouthwash gargles and brush your teeth twice a day for keeping plaque and deposits less accumulated. I hope this helps."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor,I am trying to conceive but my husband and I did cocaine a week ago. How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases.

I cannot breathe from my nose even if it is not blocked because I feel like I get less oxygen from my nose. I also have asthma and as the seasons change my allergies react. I always have running nose or sore throat or excessive sneezing and coughing. This would last for a few days and sometimes a week but it goes away and I will be fine for a few months; but this is always building up and now I have sinus due to this. The sinus was not that bad in the beginning but now the sinus has become worse. The mucus is very thick and its color gets yellow and green, my nose gets fully blocked and then my asthma gets worse and I cannot breathe from my mouth or nose. I have tried many allergy medications like singular, zyrtec, claritin, etc. They do not help. So everytime I reach chronic conditions, my doctor always gives me some form of steroids and antibiotics to calm down the condition. It helps but provides only a temporary relief and I know it would come back within a next few months. I am looking for a better solution than a temporary relief. Please give suggestion.","Doctor":"Hi. I totally understand your concern regarding cure of allergies. Unfortunately, allergy of the nose cannot be totally cured, but definitely can be prevented. I would recommend the following:1. Get an allergy skin test done; so as to identify the allergen.  Avoiding the allergen is half the solution to the problem. The allergen source could be dust sources like carpets/bedding/mattresses. Avoid indoor plants/pollens. Pet fur/hair is also a common cause. 2. Get a CT scan of your sinuses. You could be having polyps in your sinuses; which may be contributing to your nose block. If so; your ENT doctor may advise you to undergo a surgery to open up your sinuses; to enable you to breathe better. 3. Taking a steroid spray regularly will give relief of your symptoms. You do need to take it for 2-3 months during the season. Taking an antihistamine like allegra with steroid sprays is beneficial in moderate allergic rhinitis. 4. The latest treatment is Immunotherapy; offered in some allergy centres. You can contact your local specialist for the same. It is a permanent cure; but it takes a long time for the immunity to develop. Hope the above helps. If you do have a scan, do share it with me and I can guide you further. Keep your allergies under control; as a neglected sneeze can lead to aggravation of your wheeze.

How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

I want to assure you not to worry as everything is going to be fine if proper care and treatment is opted in for. I have thoroughly gone through your case and can well understand your genuine health concerns. 1. No, there is not much problem right now as he vomited and also had a lot of water. It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases. Because, it is a volatile compound and causes vapors entering the lungs through the airways. 3. As it was only two drops, I do not think it may cause much trouble. If he feels short of breath contact me back, otherwise fine. 1. He should avoid re-exposure. 2.

For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations. If the size and number of cysts are more, then I suggest consulting a gynecologist as you may require surgery.

As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses.

I just had my hair cut and noticed a mole on the back of my neck near my scalp. I might have had it for a while and did not know about it. Most of my moles are brown and auburn.

As far as small cysts are concerned they are unmatured eggs which failed to induce menstrual cycle previously, as a result, they got collected in the ovary and they will remain in the ovary. Now, you have got your periods you can start trying for conception. But I advise you to do it under the supervision of a nearby gynecologist because egg size is important while conception and that you can know by ovulation study.

He was born at 29 weeks. His birth weight was 1.26 kg. Due to his preterm birth, the baby was in NICU for 45 days and got discharged. During birth, he had RDS and a surfactant was given and later supported with CPAP for five days. Feeding was done with OG tube and slowly shifted to oral feed after 25 days (spoon feeds). Initially, he had feed intolerance, but he is fine now. NN jaundice was diagnosed and phototherapy was given. At discharge advice, weight: 1.89 kg, height: 45 cm, HC: 30 cm, breastfeed on demand, spoon feed every 2 hours. Medications: Caffeine 9 mg (now stopped), multivitamin drops (D3 and A to Z), Domstal suspension 0.5 ml, iron supplement 0.4 ml.As of today, he is 65 days old and his weight is 2.42 kg. In the last 24 hours, he is passing more liquid stools and not like a paste. His usual pattern is one to three stools per day. But, in the last 24 hours, he pooped at least 10 times and most are a bit watery. He is exclusively breastfed. No formula is being given. Is it a sign of loose motion? If so, what should be done? During his stay at the hospital, he caught a mild cold. His doctor gave him nasal saline drops and we are using it. It has been almost three weeks now and the baby is slightly coughing. One week back his pediatrician told no medication needs to be given and it will go away. He makes a lot of noise while sleeping. How to treat this cold and cough in a preterm baby? Will this lead to any other complication? His feeding is a challenge. He likes breastfeed, but sucks only for three to four minutes and falls asleep. If we try to wake him up, he is not active to take the further feed and within the next 30 to 40 minutes, he will wake up and demand feed. Due to this frequent feed, my wife gets really tired. Spoon feed he is taking but that too not as expected. He is passing urine well. My concern is whether he will drink enough milk when put on the breast? What should be the pattern to follow? He frequently makes a lot of grunting noises. We are much worried and doubt if it is because of any pain or discomfort. Are these sounds and moves normal?","Doctor":"Hello.

My height is 172 cm and I am 58 kg weight. Daily I am sneezing in the morning and following that if I do not take medicine then I will get high fever and cold along with it. The sneeze only temporarily relieved with medication, but recurs when I stop the medicine. I had breathing problem in the past. The doctor said that in my blood, the eosinophil cell count are more.  What should I do?","Doctor":"Hi.I have looked through your reports (attachment removed to protect patient identity). Also, I wish to know the following details to make a more decisive diagnosis. You appears to have allergic rhinitis. Also in the past, the breathing trouble could have been asthma. Asthma and allergic rhinitis are related and occur together in many patients. However, I cannot be sure of the diagnosis until I see your past reports. You should go for IgE antibody test. An elevated IgE antibody suggests allergic rhinitis. Your complete blood count and sputum reports are normal. The absolute eosinophil count and eosinophil percent are normal. The spirometry have mild abnormality. You have moderate lung restriction, but that is not the cause of your sneezing. This restriction most probably could be a resultant of the breathing trouble you suffered in the past. The medications given by your doctor are fine. Those will be the same that I would also give. Some suggestions I would like to make are as follows: Allergy is not curable. It points to some form of hypersensitivity by your body to some daily routine substances which do not produce allergy in other persons. However, with the right precautions and care you can avoid occurrences of allergic symptoms. Also with the right treatment you can prevent any severity of the symptoms. 1. Smoke, cold winds, pollen, dust mites. 2. Passive smoke and burning substances. 3. Food allergy can be due to milk, nuts, prawns, soy, etc.  Take a diary and maintain your daily activities. Write down meticulously the food you eat also. Suppose you get allergy one day, you note down and see if there was anything suspicious you did because of which you might have developed the allergy. This will help in avoidance of the suspected allergen. Send me all reports regarding your past history. 1. Allergic rhinitis. 2. Non - Allergic rhinitis with eosinophilia syndrome. Follow the same treatment plan that your doctor has given in his prescription with the suggestions that I have made above. 1. No smoking or passive smoking. 2. Drink plenty of lukewarm water. Drink four to five liters of water daily. 3. Avoid cold drinks, alcohol and aerated cool drinks. Take meals hot rather than cold. 4. If working in dust atmosphere try changing your workplace. If not possible wear a mask that prevents inhalation of pathogens. 5. Maintain a diary and consciously note down any incident or food products that triggers allergy. 6. Dry your hair soon after hair wash. Do not apply oil for long duration. 7. Eat nutritious food rich with all vitamins and minerals. 8. For a month take multivitamin supplements such as Himalaya Septillin or AtoZ capsules are good brands. 9. Take plenty of green leafy vegetables, gooseberry every alternate day if not daily, very rich source of Vitamin C.

This was started at 30 mg a day for five days then 20 mg a day for five days, and 15 mg, 10 mg, and 5 mg respectively. This seemed to get me rid of any tenderness in my left testicle although I was experiencing throbbing pain at the vasectomy site. A couple of days after the steroids were over, I started to experience pain again this time at the vasectomy site and it was very much a burning and stabbing pain.

So, I went home hoping that having a bath would give me relief. I rang the doctor and he told me to keep going with hot baths for some days. It did give me relief for an hour or so.

My mother always curses me and my brothers. Our family is wealthy, educated but my mother and father have some domestic issues which have never ever been closed even I have become 18 years old.

I need to contact a psychiatrist or psychologist for better consultation.","Doctor":"Hello. You seem to have a mixed anxiety-depressive disorder. This is very common and about 10-15 percent of people have this problem. It is also very easily treatable. You will need to visit a psychiatrist and he will prescribe you SSRI type of medicines (such as Escitalopram 10 mg, or Fluoxetine 20 mg, etc) which will help with your problem. It basically happens when some neurotransmitters such as serotonin reduce in your brain leading to a problem with handling the day to day stresses of life. Medicines are usually given for two to four months and then tapered off slowly and stopped. In addition to the medicines, you can also undergo a few sessions of cognitive-behavioral therapy from a clinical psychologist. Also, do consider doing deep breathing exercises or progressive muscle relaxation daily. T.

How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

An architectural disorder is present and manifests as lentiginous hyperplasia, horizontal growth pattern, individual melanocytic hyperplasia and abnormally formed junctional nests that focally demonstrate bridging adjacent rete ridges. There is junctional asymmetry. The melanocytic cells extend to the deep margin and to both lateral margins. The pathologist called it a \\"mild to moderate\\" atypical mole and suggested that I get it excised, which I did. However, when they went to check the margins, it was upgraded from \\"mild to moderate\\" to \\"severe.\\" How concerned should I be about this? And why would a mole be upgraded upon excision?

We all are at risk to COVID19, but regular washing, sanitization of hands and use of masks outside the home can reduce the risk.

All blood were negative for any autoimmune causes, ANA, RF, ESR, CRP, etc.","Doctor":"Hi. Osteoarthritis is not an autoimmune disorder, so autoimmune markers are expected to be negative. In an osteoarthritic joint, as cartilage is irreversibly destroyed and bone abnormalities develop, movement becomes painful and more difficult. In my opinion, regarding left-hand x-ray (attachment removed to protect patient identity), I agree there is interphalangeal joint (distal more pronounced) narrowing and sclerosis. I hope this helps. Osteoarthritis. Anti-inflammatory and pain medication such as Acetaminophen and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, topical analgesics. Injections of Cortisone to decrease inflammation and physical occupational therapy, self-management strategies."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor,I am trying to conceive but my husband and I did cocaine a week ago. How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations. If the size and number of cysts are more, then I suggest consulting a gynecologist as you may require surgery.

As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses.

Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

I have thoroughly gone through your case and can well understand your genuine health concerns. 1. No, there is not much problem right now as he vomited and also had a lot of water. It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases. Because, it is a volatile compound and causes vapors entering the lungs through the airways. 3. As it was only two drops, I do not think it may cause much trouble. If he feels short of breath contact me back, otherwise fine. 1. He should avoid re-exposure. 2.

For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations. If the size and number of cysts are more, then I suggest consulting a gynecologist as you may require surgery.

As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses.

The symptoms were cough, SOB, chest pain, and wheezing. I was treated for pneumonia but never got better. Repeated X-rays showed adenopathy as a possibility. So, a CT scan was done which showed hilar, mediastinal adenopathy and a single pulmonary nodule of 1.2 cm along with some hypodense lesions on the spleen. A biopsy was done on the lung tissue and on the endobronchial mass but not on the lymph nodes or nodule. There was no fungal, bacterial or viral cause isolated. I have been largely asymptomatic since then with an exception of some chest pain. I went in for a follow-up CT scan last week. There is still hilar, mediastinal adenopathy and now pre-tracheal aortopulmonary adenopathy along with the nodule. But, the size is the same. The doctor wants a CT scan in four months and thinks this could be the result of a fungal infection but he is not sure.

Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction.

In that same week, I had unprotected sex with my fiance, and I had my periods the next day. The next month I got my periods two weeks earlier, and I thought it was because of stopping the birth control pills. But that period was like no other that I ever had in my life. The only time that I would bleed was when I want to go pee, and then a lot of dark red and thick blood would come out. I am having such periods since eight months now. I have also been feeling nauseous all the time, my head hurts, and my lower stomach feels funny. I have back pain, sore breast, the smell of some foods drive me crazy, and I feel something moving around in my belly. I went to the doctor, but the pregnancy blood test came back negative, and the home pregnancy tests are also negative. I do not know what to do. I feel like something is going on in my body. My weight is little above normal. Please help.","Doctor":"Hi. I understand your concern. I see two problems in your history. Let me tell you the reason and solution. Birth control pills come in a pack of 21 or 21 active plus seven dummy pills, or the single dose of an emergency contraceptive pill. Whichever you take, will suppress your body's natural hormones. If you forget to take the pill in between or take it haphazardly, your natural cycle is out of the track, but do not worry as it can be corrected. Get a urine pregnancy test done, if not done recently. Then have the same oral combined birth control pill (21 pills) twice a day for ten days and throw away the last pill. Within next 7 to 10 days you will surely have your periods. All these bleeding on and off will disappear and then from the first day of the bleeding, have the next packet of 21 pills once at night for 21 days. Your BMI (body mass index) is more, which is the bigger problem. From your history I presume you to have PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), this is usually associated with obesity, irregular menstrual cycles, no periods for few months, followed by heavy periods with clots and fleshy masses, spotting on and off. You develop an extra pad of fat around the mid segment of the body, especially waist, thighs, and breast. Excessive body hair growth, hair fall, dark lower half of the face, acne, oily face, dark skin in the back of the neck, inner thighs and under surface of the breast. PCOS will not allow ovulation to occur at times and so you cannot get pregnant till treated. It also increases your chances of early pregnancy abortions. But, this has a solution. Just delay pregnancy for a few months as your weight has to be reduced. Once you reduce your weight, you would not need any medicine to get periods or to get pregnant, and the pregnancy will be healthy. I suggest you try the following to reduce weight. Try to reduce 2 to 4 kg per month. Do not hurry on weight reduction, as it will be difficult to maintain. As soon as you reduce at least 5 kg, you will see changes.

I had been diagnosed with post-concussion syndrome and saw several neurologists who ran numerous tests and scans but never did anything for me. The problems I have had are brain fogginess, slight memory problems, increased anxiety, lower sex drive, sleep problems, concentration difficulties, slight dizziness and an overall feeling of not feeling 'myself'. I have dealt with these issues for around eight years and pretty much gave up on trying to feel 'normal'. Recently, I read about how TBI can cause pituitary damage leading to growth hormone deficiency which covers several of my problems and has been underdiagnosed in patients who had TBI. I also had a severe ankle break from sliding during a paintball game a couple of years ago, five breaks in my ankle and one of the worst the surgeon had seen. I understand low bone density could also be caused by low GH and could have attributed to the severity of my break. I had also been concussed on one or two other occasions less severe than the one nine years ago. Is low GH something that I could have and should look into screening for?","Doctor":"Hello. I just read your query and from what you have mentioned, I feel that you could have osteoporosis or osteopenia rather than growth hormone deficiency. You can have your bone DEXA scan done and follow up with your orthopedician if it turns out to be either. Growth hormone deficiency causes a loss of muscle mass rather than decreased bone mineral density. Regarding dizziness, it could be benign positional vertigo for which you can see an ENT specialist. A traumatic brain injury does not mean severe concussion. Both are involving different areas of the brain. If you are still in doubt, you can have an insulin tolerance test for growth hormone reserve assessment. Hope you find my advice beneficial. Good luck.

I previously tried Valproic acid, Lithium, Carbamazepine, Xanax, Lorazepam, Clonazepam, Rudotel, Lexotanil, Fluoxetine, Sertraline, and Escitalopram. SSRI does not have an effect on me. Right now, I take Lamictal 50 mg daily and Tranxene 5x5 mg daily. Tranxene loses its anxiolytic effects and my anxiety becomes more severe. I am planning to titrate Lamictal 100 mg. However, it should not help with anxiety. What are my treatment options? Benzodiazepines are not an option because I am getting used to them. Two days later I have a consultation with my psychiatrist, but I want to hear possible treatment for my conditions from another option. I have done thyroid, heart function, men hormones, prolactin, kidney and liver function tests. All are normal.","Doctor":"Hello. If your anxiety is not responsive to SSRI's (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors), then you should consider trying TCA (tricyclic antidepressants) class of antidepressants. They will help with your anxiety and panic attacks. Apart from Tranxene and Benzodiazepines, there are few other options for anxiolysis. If you are specifically looking for something to be added to the TCA such as Propranolol, Buspirone, Tofisopam, Clobazam, Hydroxyzine, and Pregabalin. Also, you can consider Mirtazapine, which will act as an antidepressant and also for anxiolysis. It is a NaSSA (Noradrenergic and specific serotonergic) class of antidepressants."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor,I am trying to conceive but my husband and I did cocaine a week ago. How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

He vomited and had lot of salt water. Please advice for any side effect.","Doctor":"Hi. I want to assure you not to worry as everything is going to be fine if proper care and treatment is opted in for. I have thoroughly gone through your case and can well understand your genuine health concerns. 1. No, there is not much problem right now as he vomited and also had a lot of water. It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases. Because, it is a volatile compound and causes vapors entering the lungs through the airways. 3. As it was only two drops, I do not think it may cause much trouble. If he feels short of breath contact me back, otherwise fine. 1. He should avoid re-exposure. 2. Rule out if there is some sort of suicidal ideation due to depression or anxiety and take him to a psychiatrist for physical evaluation.

I used it for 30 days continuously, but no use. How many days should I take that powder and how to overcome this problem?","Doctor":"Hello. For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations. If the size and number of cysts are more, then I suggest consulting a gynecologist as you may require surgery. If the number and size of cysts are less, you may continue treatment along with syrup Evecare 10 ml BD and Kanchnar Guggulu two BD.

She had taken my blood sample and it was negative. But, still I have not gotten my periods and it has been a week ahead. What could be the reason for my late periods?","Doctor":"Hello. As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses. For further information consult an obstetrician and gynaecologist online -->"},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am a 40-year-old dental surgeon with no past or present health issues and I am trying to conceive. I have a regular cycle of 28 days and I have consulted a gynaecologist before who has put me on Clomid for three months. I have also taken all the required fertility tests which show normal values that are needed for conceiving. This cycle I had all the pregnancy symptoms like implantation spotting for two days, tender breasts and lower abdominal mild cramps for a week after spotting. However, I have got a negative urine and blood test, blood hCG level being 1.2 mIU/mL. On the first day of the last period, there was spotting and light bleeding was seen for three to four days. I tested for blood hCG after seven days and it showed <1.2 mIU/mL. I want to know if there is still a chance that I could be pregnant and retest myself after a few days?","Doctor":"Hello. As your serum beta hCG (human chorionic gonadotropin) result is also negative it definitely indicates you have not got pregnant in this cycle. The symptoms you have mentioned could also be possible because of the progesterone hormone secretion in the postovulatory phase which may mimic pregnancy and the spotting could be due to the breakthrough bleed. A possibility of delayed conception can be taken into consideration but because the serum beta hCG is negative it is ruled out. I would suggest you get your day two LH (luteinizing hormone), FSH (follicle-stimulating hormone), prolactin, TSH (thyroid-stimulating hormone) levels, fasting blood sugar and postprandial blood sugar levels, and serum AMH (anti-Mullerian hormone) levels and an HSG (hysterosalpingography) done and let me know the results.  The treatment plan would be ovulation induction with a follicular study.

Please help. Is Emeset-4 not safe during pregnancy? I have hypothyroidism. My TSH is 4.432 and hemoglobin is 7.8 g/dL. I really need your help and advice.","Doctor":"Hello. It is not advisable to take Emeset-4 (Ondansetron) during pregnancy so frequently. 6 to 7 large quantity vomits per day is considered normal, also small quantity 10 to 15 vomits per day is also normal. No treatment is required in either case. These are pregnancy-induced vomiting and should not be stopped. Nature has done it in good faith to avoid baby to get unwanted infections. So, one should not stop them. Try to get adjusted. It is absolutely fine even if you do not eat anything in a day. If you lose weight in the first 4 months, it is normal. Try to eat dry things like puffed rice, biscuits, roti, etc. Avoid juices, liquids, coconut water, etc. These vomitings should stop by next month. If you want to take some medication, then I suggest trying tablet Pregnidoxin (combination of Caffeine and Meclizine), three times a day on an empty stomach. Firstly, try to consider these vomiting normal, then you will automatically get better. For hemoglobin of 7.8 g/dL, please get a hemoglobin electrophoresis done to rule hemoglobinopathies. Start with iron tablets as early as possible. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent.

I visited my PCP and she thought it was either vitiligo or a fungal infection. She gave me a Ketoconazole shampoo and ointment. Then I visited a dermatologist to see if it was vitiligo. She used a wood lamp and she confirmed that it was not vitiligo and said I had seborrheic dermatitis. She gave me a steroid called Desonide. She also told me to keep using ketoconazole. I used the steroid and the whiteness of the spots went down but still, they are slightly present.

Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations. If the size and number of cysts are more, then I suggest consulting a gynecologist as you may require surgery.

As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves.

Now, you have got your periods you can start trying for conception. But I advise you to do it under the supervision of a nearby gynecologist because egg size is important while conception and that you can know by ovulation study.

It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases. Because, it is a volatile compound and causes vapors entering the lungs through the airways. 3. As it was only two drops, I do not think it may cause much trouble. If he feels short of breath contact me back, otherwise fine. 1. He should avoid re-exposure. 2. Rule out if there is some sort of suicidal ideation due to depression or anxiety and take him to a psychiatrist for physical evaluation.

I used it for 30 days continuously, but no use. How many days should I take that powder and how to overcome this problem?","Doctor":"Hello. For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations. If the size and number of cysts are more, then I suggest consulting a gynecologist as you may require surgery. If the number and size of cysts are less, you may continue treatment along with syrup Evecare 10 ml BD and Kanchnar Guggulu two BD.

She had taken my blood sample and it was negative. But, still I have not gotten my periods and it has been a week ahead. What could be the reason for my late periods?","Doctor":"Hello. As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses.

At age 5, their biological father was not allowed to see our child and it remained that way for about seven years. My child is 12 now and has been diagnosed with PTSD, and has only had a few visits with a therapist. The sessions consisted of my child, husband, and myself discussing treatment. Our therapist never asked my child how he felt, or what he remembered. Questions were mostly directed to my husband and I. Our therapist decided that he would like to bring the biological father into the same room as my child and reintroduce them. Is this a standard, safe, form of PTSD treatment? I can understand the therapist having sessions with my child, recalling events, but not directly introducing them to the person that abused them. I have been trying to find specific studies that state this treatment but have not found anything involving direct reintroduction to an abuser. Thank you for your input.","Doctor":"Hello. Regards.

After a few days, pimple-like blisters appeared on the center left stomach and center lower back. I went to the doctor again on day-2 of blisters and it was already fluid-filled. The doctor prescribed Acyclovir 800 mg five per day for seven days. I stopped Acyclovir on day-4 because of severe dizziness, but the blisters are already pus-filled, and bruise-colored. I am on day-5 of shingles now. Is it alright to stop the medication? Also, what are the chances of having shingles again as I get older?","Doctor":"Hello. Completing the prescribed course of medication during an active infection will reduce the chances and increases the gap between the episodes. As the age goes on, and when there is low immunity, there are chances of reactivation of shingles again. It entirely depends on your immunity. Shingles can occur anywhere in the body.

USG is normal except for mild fatty liver. It seems that there are two issues here lack of exercise and long hours of sitting. Not lead to weak core muscles and as a result the structure of the back is feeling the strain. Usually the muscle help to take the load of the upper body but if they are weak the disc and facet joints start sharing more load and hence the back pain. The best option is to start physiotherapy, do core exercises, planks, bridges, superman position cat camel, clamshell, etc. You will get videos on the internet if you cannot go to a physiotherapist. Avoid sitting for more than 20 minutes at stretch. Preferably use a standing desk. Take a course of anti-inflammatory tablets and apply ice and pain gels though not together.

How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

A clinical exam showed slightly asymmetrical brisk knee reflex, and it is brisker on the right leg where it bothers me, not including the plantar reflexes. Everything else was said to be fine. I had EMG that was normal except for single highly polyphasic motor units with a high amplitude which signal a nerve issue at L5-L4, but my MRI only showed scoliosis which I have had since a child. I am very scared. Please advice me. You think this may be an early onset of ALS?","Doctor":"Hello. I can completely understand your concern.

I have mentioned only the ones who have the higher readings. Protein 1+ detected in dipstick, serum uric acid at 9.2 mg/dL, MPV at 12.5 fL, FBS at 112 mg/dL, HbA1c at 5.5, cholesterol at 227 mg/dL, triglycerides at 181 mg/dL, VLDL is at 36.2 mg/dL, ALT/SGPT at 48 U/L. Serum creatinine at 1.23, increased from 0.99 tested six months back. Other than this, all others were normal. I also have been infected with hepatitis B twice and vaccinated for hepatitis B. I have been a diabetic for more than two years. The HbA1c vary between 5.5 and 6.5. The first one was done two years ago. I also have hypertension for more than five years. It is not very much under control. It varies from 135/80 to 150/100 and now it has reduced a bit to 140/90. I met my general physician who advised me to check my albumin to creatinine ratio. I tested it four times. The results are as follows:  55 ug/mg, 150 mg/g, 11.4 ug/mg, 37.5 mg/g. My ultrasonogram revealed fatty liver and cystitis. All the rest is fine. My ECG was fine. I have been advised to have a urine culture. My current medications are Telma-AM 40, Dynaglipt, Ecosprin AV 75, Levofloxacin, and CTD 12.5 mg. I am not able to understand why my albumin levels are so high and I would like to know how and when can they be rectified. I have attached reports for your further reference.","Doctor":"Hello.

I take medications for IBS, Libotryp DS, Lopamide, and Hostacycline 500.","Doctor":"Hello. I went through your post. Frequent urination can be caused by UTI (urinary tract infection), raised blood sugar (diabetes), excess water intake during daytime and enlarged prostate (BHP).  You will need a urine examination, blood glucose and an ultrasonogram of the pelvis to look for prostate enlargement. Meanwhile, instead of Tetracycline for IBS (irritable bowel syndrome), I would suggest Rifaximin 400 mg twice daily. Avoid non-vegetarian foods for a while in case you consume them. Regards.

Both on the lower right and left. My back has also been sore and I have been severely constipated with sometimes green or yellow stool and pain when I try to use the bathroom. I am just wondering if this is all normal or do I need to see the doctor.","Doctor":"Hello. For more information consult a medical gastroenterologist online -->"},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I am a 30 year old Caucasian woman, 5 feet and 11 inches, 195 lbs and semi-active. My family has a history of heart problems. My mother, eldest brother, and father are all taking Metoprolol for heart arrhythmias and my maternal grandfather died of a heart attack at 55. My father also has a history of blood clots, though I tend to have the opposite problem with my blood not clotting easily at all most likely due to a vitamin K deficiency. My HDL cholesterol tends to be in the 20s and my LDL cholesterol tends to be in the 60s. I have had three different surgeries in my life. I have had a lateral release of the tendon on my left knee, my gallbladder removed, and two months ago, I had a cyst removed from my uterus. My issue is that I have been having palpitations off and on for seven months. They began after a severe case of the flu. At first, it was just the heart racing, but after a few months, it has become more of a skipped beat. The episodes last anywhere from one to 20 minutes. At first, the doctor thought it might be anxiety, but after a visit to a psychologist who specialized in anxiety, it was determined that anxiety was not the cause. The palpitations are not constant, but I also have other symptoms of lightheadedness, and pain in the chest on the left side (not sure if this is musculoskeletal or not). I also have digestive issues which may be a factor. I have had an echocardiogram with the following results:Left Ventricle: The left ventricular size is normal. LV posterior wall thickness was normal. LV systolic function was hyperdynamic. Left ventricular ejection fraction, by visual estimation, is 65 to 70 %. Spectral doppler shows a normal pattern of LV diastolic filling.Right Ventricle: The right ventricular size is normal. RV wall thickness is mildly increased.Left Atrium: The left atrium is mildly dilated.Right Atrium: The right atrium is normal in size.Aortic Valve: Mid aortic valve thickening is present.Mitral Valve: The anterior and posterior leaflets are mildly thickened. Trace mitral valve regurgitation is seen.Tricuspid Valve: Trace tricuspid regurgitation is visualized. The tricuspid regurgitant velocity predicts an estimated right ventricular systolic pressure of 27.7 mmHg with normal pulmonary pressure.Pulmonic Valve: The pulmonic valve was not well visualized. Trace pulmonic valve regurgitation.Aorta: The aortic root and ascending aorta are structurally normal with no evidence of dilation.Pulmonary Artery: The pulmonary artery is not well seen.Pericardium: There is no evidence of pericardial effusion. I also had a 48-hour Holter monitor but was sick in bed the entire time. The results were: Min HR: 50, Max HR: 160, Average HR 82, Ventricular ectopic activity consisted of seven beats, of which six were single PVCs and one was a single VE. Supraventricular ectopic activity consisted of 210 beats, of which 10 were in atrial couplets, 125 were late beats, 75 were single PACs. The longest R-R interval was 1.4 seconds. The longest N-N interval was 1.4 seconds. I have also done an overnight pulse oximetry test which came back as normal. I have also tried Metoprolol ER and nonextended release. I was only able to take it for a week as the results fixed the racing and weird beats, but after about an hour I was barely able to walk to my bed and fell asleep for 10 hours without my husband being able to wake me up no matter how hard he tried. The palpitations seem to be getting less frequent (especially since the pain from the cyst removed earlier in the year has subsided), but then I will have a week where I get them every day, a few times a day for about 20-minute increments. My husband wants me to get a 30-day heart monitor, but after working with my current cardiologist's office, we have been unable to get one after two and a half months of them saying they are sending it. My husband now wants me to go to a different cardiologist’s office, but the closest one is over three hours away. So, I wanted to get a different cardiologists opinion. Is there anything that I really need to worry about or is my heart relatively normal and this is just a case of something that I have just never experienced before? Should I continue to push to get the 30-day Holter monitor or get a new cardiologist and make the trip?","Doctor":"Hello. I went through your reports. Regards.

Seven months ago I began experiencing pain on my left side. I went to my doctor who said it was just muscle pain. The pain went on and got a lot worse. Four weeks I went to the toilet and I noticed I was peeing fresh blood the doctor gave me Trimethoprim for three days which did not help as my urine was still showing high leukocytes and blood so she gave me Ciprofloxacin 500 mg for seven days and there is still blood showing up in the dip stick tests. My doctor has ordered me a CT scan to look for kidney stones but with this world virus, I am not going to get my appointment anytime soon as we are in lockdown. My urine looks clear now but I have noticed today there are streaks of blood in it now and I am terrified incase I have cancer. I am still getting a stingy pain onmy left side which comes and goes and sometimes shooting pain. I have multiple sclerosis also and I took my treatment of immunosuppressants in the last five weeks. I am honestly going out my mind with worry incase this is cancer. I am worried about the streaks of blood when I urinate as this has been going on for about four weeks now it clears then it comes back again.","Doctor":"Hi. I have gone through your queries. Please relax and sit at home. Do not worry. You need not be in a hurry to get a CT (computed tomography) urogram done at this pandemic state. I am explaining the condition now. You are having hematuria associated with flank pain. Hematuria was episodic. At your age and profile, it is unlikely that you have a urinary bladder or upper tract cancer. The possibility is very less. Probable cause of your hematuria is stone disease. It may be a kidney stone or ureteric stone. You get these investigations done, once the lockdown gets over. Check your serum creatinine, CECT KUB and CT urogram (if creatinine is within normal limits). These will tell you the final diagnosis. In the meantime you can take tablet Tamsulosin 0.4 mg one tablet at bedtime for 30 days, Drotaverine 80 mg SOS when you have pain. Tamsulosin cannot be taken if you are having pregnancy.

I then had an intercourse with my partner on the 12th of this month. The next morning, at 10 o clock, I had a pinkish bleeding and severe pain in my lower abdomen. This bleeding was not like my period, but I used a pad nevertheless. In the last four days of bleeding, each day I changed only one pad whereas in my regular cycle, more bleeding occurs.

How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

I have thoroughly gone through your case and can well understand your genuine health concerns. 1. No, there is not much problem right now as he vomited and also had a lot of water. It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases. Because, it is a volatile compound and causes vapors entering the lungs through the airways. 3. As it was only two drops, I do not think it may cause much trouble.

For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations. If the size and number of cysts are more, then I suggest consulting a gynecologist as you may require surgery. If the number and size of cysts are less, you may continue treatment along with syrup Evecare 10 ml BD and Kanchnar Guggulu two BD.

As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses.

I recently took an online psychology test and found myself to be a dismissive-avoidant personality type. I took the test because everything is not fine in my life and I want some solution. I am single, and highly educated, managing my own business and live with my parents. These are the details about my life and problems happening. Personality: I am an introvert and do not like attending social or family gatherings. The last time I attended any marriage party was twelve years ago of my brother's. I do not have any friends now and had few friends during college. I do not like waiting in line, crowded place or traveling much. I like to spend time alone, reading, listening to music, etc. I work from home alone since my nature of work is online and have not taken a break from work in the last five years. I am a kind of person who wants control, freedom, independence in life, very practical and live in the present. I hide many personal feelings and do not share them with others because for me it is a private matter. I feel like I trapped myself in a self-imposed social isolation and do not know how to come out of that. Family: Mine is an upper-middle-class family. My elder sister and brother are married and stay outside. I am the youngest of the three and live with my parents. In childhood and adulthood, my relationship with my family members was good. As I got older and learned the real meaning of life, it feels like all the relationships are transactional in nature. They care for you till you have resources and once your money is over none care for you. I know parents care for you if you care for them and same is the case for siblings. Frankly speaking, I do not have a good relationship with anyone in the family. They do not like me due to my nature of living in own world and avoiding family gatherings. Relationships: I had many failed relationships in the last ten years and most of them were long-distance. I have not yet gotten over the pain of my past breakups and some pain is still inside. It feels my heart is broken, but I am smiling to make myself and others happy. Some relationships did not sustain due to my partner not agreeing, family not agreeing, incompatibility in choices, etc. I moved from one broken relationship to another just to forget the breakup pain. Now, I am cold to relationships, have commitment problems, and feel like running away from responsibilities. I have taken decisions in life thinking about my career or goal without thinking about my partner's feelings and the effect on the relationship. I am in another relationship now and thinking of marriage, but somehow my past breakups and personality issues are causing a problem. These are some queries I need your help with. Is there any problem in my personality or life? What is the solution to problems in my personality or life? Am I having a dismissive-avoidant personality issue? What is the cure for dismissive-avoidant personality? What other suggestions would you like to give me? Looking forward your reply. Thank you.","Doctor":"Hello. I understand.

But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

He vomited and had lot of salt water. Please advice for any side effect.","Doctor":"Hi. I want to assure you not to worry as everything is going to be fine if proper care and treatment is opted in for. I have thoroughly gone through your case and can well understand your genuine health concerns. 1. No, there is not much problem right now as he vomited and also had a lot of water. It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases. Because, it is a volatile compound and causes vapors entering the lungs through the airways. 3. As it was only two drops, I do not think it may cause much trouble. If he feels short of breath contact me back, otherwise fine. 1. He should avoid re-exposure. 2. Rule out if there is some sort of suicidal ideation due to depression or anxiety and take him to a psychiatrist for physical evaluation.

For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations. If the size and number of cysts are more, then I suggest consulting a gynecologist as you may require surgery. If the number and size of cysts are less, you may continue treatment along with syrup Evecare 10 ml BD and Kanchnar Guggulu two BD.

As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses.

One year ago, I was suffering from a hard stool that was difficult to pass. I went to a gastroenterologist, who did a colonoscopy and found that I had an anal fissure and internal hemorrhoid. He prescribed Sitcom Forte, Eldicet, Velgut, and Pankreoflat. He also gave me Sucralcoat Ano cream. However, every night I was in too much pain. So, early this year, I decided to consult an Ayurveda doctor who gave me some Kashayams and tablets. However, my pain did not subside. I used to evacuate the stools using my fingers. That eliminated the stools, but there was so much mucus released and extreme pain after motion. Two months ago, I went to a GP who gave me some antibiotics and painkillers for five days. During this time, I was always sleepy. I took leave from work and was always tired and fatigued. Earlier this month, I went to another GI specialist who did a sigmoidoscopy and said that it is SRUS. He said that I should not finger evacuate the stools and gave me liquid paraffin and LoX cream. Now, my current situation is that it has been three days and I am very constipated and fatigued. The pain has subsided a little. However, I am not passing stools as I used to before. After I drink water or eat something, I get a vomiting sensation. I get anxiety and panic attacks as I am scared about my condition and do not know which doctor I should consult and what I should do. Is this condition serious and life-long? Will I ever be cured? Please advise on the correct medications (allopathy or ayurveda), lifestyle changes and other things to take care.","Doctor":"Hello.

I find it hard to talk to people, especially in public. I also have a problem with talking about my feelings face to face, making the idea of a therapist very nerve-wrecking. I am not sure if I would talk. I would probably just be too nervous to talk to him/her. I love animals. I love the company of them and feel safe around them. I am homeschooled, so I do not have any real-life friends. My family does not treat me the best, often blaming me for everything, insulting me and putting me on the spot in uncomfortable situations instead of getting me help. I am very lonely, but my anxiety makes it really hard to interact with people face to face, and very difficult to get a job. I have the idea to get a therapy dog. I believe it would help me in many ways, such as increase my exercise (which is a known depression-reliever), build self-confidence, offering a distraction, making me more courageous in public, enabling me to work, and much more. With that in mind, here are my questions. Do you believe that, for my case, a therapy dog would be a better form of therapy than an in-real-life, face-to-face therapist? Or, at least to begin with, then I could move on to a real therapist. If not better, do you think that a therapy dog is still a good idea? If so, what can I say to my mom to get her to allow me to get help for my mental issues? Thank you for your time.","Doctor":"Hello. A therapy dog can help in relieving anxiety. But, since your anxiety is related to social situations, I do not think that a therapy dog will relieve your social anxiety. The anxiety will go away with exposure or by systematic desensitization. You have to take the first step for that. Talk to your parents about this and convey to them that you find it hard to interact with people and tell them directly that you have anxiety. This will be the first step towards treatment. Once you see the doctor, with time, your anxiety will go away and your conversation skills will improve.

I want to assure you not to worry as everything is going to be fine if proper care and treatment is opted in for. I have thoroughly gone through your case and can well understand your genuine health concerns. 1. No, there is not much problem right now as he vomited and also had a lot of water. It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases. Because, it is a volatile compound and causes vapors entering the lungs through the airways. 3. As it was only two drops, I do not think it may cause much trouble. If he feels short of breath contact me back, otherwise fine. 1. He should avoid re-exposure. 2. Rule out if there is some sort of suicidal ideation due to depression or anxiety and take him to a psychiatrist for physical evaluation.

I used it for 30 days continuously, but no use. How many days should I take that powder and how to overcome this problem?","Doctor":"Hello. For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations. If the size and number of cysts are more, then I suggest consulting a gynecologist as you may require surgery. If the number and size of cysts are less, you may continue treatment along with syrup Evecare 10 ml BD and Kanchnar Guggulu two BD.

She had taken my blood sample and it was negative. But, still I have not gotten my periods and it has been a week ahead. What could be the reason for my late periods?","Doctor":"Hello. As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses.

I have never been in any type of injury and had MRIs done of my brain, cervical, lumbar, and thoracic spine five years ago. They stated I had three bulging discs and an annular tear. My thoracic spine noted a few scattered hemangiomas and a questionable small vascular anomaly in the midthoracic vertebral body. This is where my pain hurts the most. On the cervical spine MRI, it stated that I had a narrowing of the canal with degenerative disc disease with no spinal cord abnormality. My MRI of the brain came back fine with some inflammation within the paranasal sinuses and moderate lymph nodes in the neck which may be suspicious for shotty adenopathy.My first positive ANA was four years ago with elevated antistreptolysin O Ab, but never have I had strep throat or ever been diagnosed or treated for it. I had my adenoids removed when I was young. My CBC was all normal except for a slightly deranged RBC and hematocrit levels that were lower than the normal range. My TSH was elevated at 5.870, but I believe I had that retested later on, and it was within normal limits. I was then referred to a rheumatologist due to the positive ANA and other symptoms that I was having. Their results concluded no elevation of dRVVT or a PTT and ruled Lupus screening negative due to my levels being within normal limits. My C3 is at 121, C4 is 31 and rheumatoid factor.","Doctor":"Hello. I went through your post. You have not mentioned what you want to know and what your current problem is. Regards.

She missed her periods this time and had a pregnancy test, which came back positive. She took a single tablet of Mifepristone at 2 p.m. The medical person asked her to take the first pill at 2 p.m. and then another one after 55 hours at 9 p.m. and then again two tablets after 12 hours at 9 a.m. and then the remaining two pills. Is this right?","Doctor":"Hello. There are two types of medicines in the MTP kit (medical termination of pregnancy), one is Mifepristone, and the other one is Misoprostol. They are not always successful. There are 4 % to 5 % chances that one may require a surgical evacuation. You should have got an ultrasound before starting this medicine to confirm if the pregnancy was intrauterine or outside the uterus. Only after it is confirmed that the pregnancy is intrauterine and less than nine weeks, you can take the MTP kit. It has two types of tablets. One is Mifepristone 200 mg which is to be taken immediately. The other one is the Misoprostol tablet and 800 mcg of it has to be taken. That is, all the four tablets are to be inserted in the vagina after being slightly soaked in waterdrops to dissolve easily after 24 to 48 hours of the first medicine taken. Lie down for one hour after the vaginal medicines. You will start bleeding after four to six hours of inserting Misoprostol. It may result in bleeding more than your periods, which will last for five to six days. I suggest you get an ultrasound done after two weeks to look for any retained pregnancy remnants.

But, she is feeling nauseous and dizzy even though she takes food every two hours. Her random blood sugar test is done, and the values are between 41 and 51. We then give her some sweets. This is happening even if she does not take any blood sugar medicine. Her blood pressure is 86/60. One and a half years ago, she got a heart attack. She got an angiography done, which showed triple vessel disease and two blocks. The doctor suggested her to have a CABG. But, we did not go for this as the patient was not willing. She did an EECP for 35 days, and this helped her a lot.She was able to lead a normal life for a few months, and then the pain started getting bad again. She started getting water retention and breathing problems a year ago. We took her to a cardiologist who prescribed her the following medications. She has been on them since a year. She is on Aztogold, Angiplat, Nicoduce, Vogli-gm 1, Exenta T 20, Cordarone 100, Vymada100, Synx 500, Carvidon-OD, Zyloric for 10 days, Thyronorm 12.5 mcg, and D-Shine once a week. In the past, she has been on Ecosprin, Atorva, Nikoran, Clopitab, Myonit, and Sorbitrate. A 2D echo done three days ago shows an EF of 35 % to 40 %.She is diabetic. Her fasting blood sugar is 87, and her postprandial blood sugar is 104. Her HbA1c is 8.2, her TSH is 11.27, uric acid is at 8.5, and her vitamin D is at 10.41. She is currently prescribed the above-mentioned medications, and I want an opinion about this and a suggestion for further treatment. Even though she has not taken the Vogli-gm 1 for the past two days, her random blood sugar level is very low at 40 to 50, and she feels dizzy and weak. I am not sure what is causing this. Any advice on this would be helpful.","Doctor":"Hello. Well, your mother seems to have issues with her blood sugar and thyroid together along with the heart problems. This makes a vicious circle leading to symptoms getting interrelated thereby creating a worse scenario. She is having high TSH (thyroid-stimulating hormone) levels that can either be due to underworking of the thyroid gland or from some issues with the pituitary gland (a small pea-sized gland that plays a major role in regulating vital body functions) or the hypothalamus (a small area in the center of the brain). She should consult her physician to adjust the dosage of medications that she is taking for her thyroid issues. I would recommend you to take her to an endocrinologist for a better input in this regard. Although angioplasty and stenting would not be beneficial to her, you can consult her cardiologist in this regard. Her vitamin D levels are low. Try to take her outside for a little walk or at least just sitting in sunlight. This will help regulate her vitamin D levels if there is no issue with her liver and kidneys. Apply sunscreen to avoid any sunburns that may happen. Hope this helps. Please feel free to let me know if you need any further assistance. I would be happy to assist.

How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

They seem to come every six weeks and yet nothing really on the pad. I only see blood when I go to the toilet and urinate. The flow of my period must be very bad as I need to urinate for it to come out. Why are my periods still every six weeks and still nothing really on the pad? I have not been pregnant so far. Hopefully, I am not. Now, I have a new concern. A few days ago, I was masturbating, rubbing my clitoris and vagina and I noticed a bit of blood on my finger. I did not feel any pain, but I saw the blood. Two days in a row, I masturbated and saw blood on my finger. I am not sure where exactly the blood is from. This is the first time I have seen blood while masturbating. I have masturbated so many times and never noticed any blood. I thought it might be the start of a period, but I have not seen any blood in the toilet for it to be a period. My last period started five weeks ago. My period is due to come anytime, but it tends to keep coming every six weeks and is always messed up. It has been like this for maybe a year now, and I do not know why. I have been sexually active too, but with a condom. Why is there bleeding? Why has it come up the last two times I have masturbated? I did not look inside to see where exactly it was coming from. I just saw blood on my finger the last two times I rubbed my vagina and the clitoris. It has made me worried. I hope it has nothing to do with being pregnant. Does the bleeding when masturbating mean you are pregnant? Does this happen to pregnant women? I always freak out about being pregnant. Also, why is my period still messed up in terms of not good flow at all? As mentioned earlier, it only comes in the toilet and nothing on the pad, and it comes every six weeks. Also, for many times, I get big clots in the toilet, so I guess that my blood flow is thick. What do lots of clots mean and why is my period still messed up? I have been stressed for ages, but that should have gone by now. Maybe my hormone levels are low. The blood when I masturbated the last two times is of concern to me. Please, can you explain why my periods are still messed up? Why are there clots? Why was there blood when I masturbated the last two times as I have not had any blood before. Hope you can give me a detailed answer.","Doctor":"Hello. Regards.

This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

I want to assure you not to worry as everything is going to be fine if proper care and treatment is opted in for. I have thoroughly gone through your case and can well understand your genuine health concerns. 1. No, there is not much problem right now as he vomited and also had a lot of water. It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases. Because, it is a volatile compound and causes vapors entering the lungs through the airways. 3. As it was only two drops, I do not think it may cause much trouble. If he feels short of breath contact me back, otherwise fine. 1. He should avoid re-exposure. 2.

I used it for 30 days continuously, but no use. How many days should I take that powder and how to overcome this problem?","Doctor":"Hello. For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations. If the size and number of cysts are more, then I suggest consulting a gynecologist as you may require surgery. If the number and size of cysts are less, you may continue treatment along with syrup Evecare 10 ml BD and Kanchnar Guggulu two BD.

She had taken my blood sample and it was negative. But, still I have not gotten my periods and it has been a week ahead. What could be the reason for my late periods?","Doctor":"Hello. As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses.

I am scared of having sex now because of the irritation, itching, and discharge I have later. What can I do to solve this problem? Are there any creams or tablets that I can take? And is this a temporary thing or will it happen every time we have sex?","Doctor":"Hello. If you have developed a yeast infection after having intercourse, then it is likely that it has been transferred to you by your partner. He needs to be treated with antifungal medication after getting a urethral culture done to confirm the infection. At present, you may opt for Clingen vaginal pessary (a combination of Clindamycin, Clotrimazole, and Tinidazole) once at night per vaginally for six days and capsule Itraconazole 200 mg once a day for three days. This will help treat the infection completely. Avoid sex for a week till you are treated. Also, ensure that your partner is treated before you have sex again. Regards.

See Kalarachi Kai choornam is helpful in amenorrhea. As far as small cysts are concerned they are unmatured eggs which failed to induce menstrual cycle previously, as a result, they got collected in the ovary and they will remain in the ovary. Now, you have got your periods you can start trying for conception. But I advise you to do it under the supervision of a nearby gynecologist because egg size is important while conception and that you can know by ovulation study.

How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill.

Will she be pregnant? In case she becomes pregnant, suggest any options other than abortion.","Doctor":"Hi, Thanks for posting your query at icliniq. You have taken emergency contraception as advised. That is very good. 99% of the times this will work well, but her menstrual period may be delayed. At this point you do not have to do anything. If the periods are delayed more than a week then you have to check for pregnancy. If positive we have to deal with it then. Either way, it is better to follow some form of reliable birth control to avoid this situation in the future. Also emergency contraception is for once a cycle use only.

I have a small bump under the shaft of my penis. It looks like that it could be from masturbation, but I am not sure. There is no itching or burning. It is not an open sore either. I recently had protected oral sex with a sex worker with no genital contact at all. The condom was on the whole time. I have attached a photo. I have a scar above it from surgery from a deformity at birth if you were wondering what that was. Also, I have been diagnosed with HPV in the past and had two separate warts around three years ago. I am currently on Zoloft and Wellbutrin XL.","Doctor":"Hi. It appears to be a wart (attachment removed to protect patient identity). As you have a history of HPV (human papilloma virus) in the past, the wart should be the first concern. HPV depending on the strain cause both genital and non-genital warts. They are not painful. On long-standing, these warts or HPV infection will predispose to malignancy. You should have a constant check on the symptoms. The differential diagnosis can be traumatic one which might be improving with time, but the negative point to this is no pain. Another differential can be another sexually transmitted infection as you have had recent intercourse, but you have got protected sex and so it is unlikely. 1. HPV warts. 2. Mechanical traumatic ulcer. 3. STI (sexually transmitted infection).

After 6 months I got the same issue. I consulted another dermatologist, he gave me antihistamine tablets and cream and he said that it might be due to stress.

Generalized anxiety disorder is a simple anxiety disorder which is very easy to treat with medicines if it is combined with psychotherapy and progressive counseling. Medicines alone cannot cure it.

There are many aspects to be looked into including the puberty onset and psychological changes that take place during the onset of adolescence. Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder , ADHD also should be suspected. I suggest not to worry much and consult your psychiatrist.

The first breakout was around five weeks ago. I noticed a red spot above my left eyebrow after hearing a stressful news and eventually it spread to my chin and above my lip. I was at the beach and after around three days, the rash hardened and left. The skin was kind of dry. The rash has a blister look to it up close and is red. It looks like a ton of little pimples and some of the spots even have what look like whiteheads. It is not painful but does itch somewhat. One week later, the rash came back and I decided to see a dermatologist. The dermatologist said I had seborrheic dermatitis, but did not take a sample to have a lab test or anything. She basically just looked at my face and told me what I had. She prescribed me Ketoconazole for two weeks day and night. It kind of came and went. The Ketoconazole cream I guess worked because I did not break for around two weeks. Well, I just stopped the Ketoconazole five days ago and today, I woke up to the same blister-looking rash again. This literally happened overnight. It has just gotten worse throughout the day. Now I have it above my left eyebrow up onto my forehead, the bridge of my nose and around my right eye, chin, above the lip, and some on the right cheek. I need help. Was the dermatologist right when she said it is SD? Or could this be something else? I know they say the skin is scaly with SD but I am not sure my skin has a scaly look. It is more like pimply. To be honest, my skin most resembles a heat rash in the pictures. The pictures do not do it justice.","Doctor":"Hello. It could be seborrheic dermatitis or photodermatitis. Allergies may be playing a role. All these are visual diagnosis and the lab tests or biopsies have limited or no role. Seborrheic dermatitis is more commonly present with dandruff and similar rashes on the neck and sometimes upper chest. Photodermatitis would be present over the sun-exposed areas. In all of these conditions, a mild steroid cream would be useful if applied for a few days. You can apply Hydrocortisone cream mixed with Ketoconazole for 10 days, twice daily and then switch to plain Ketoconazole for the next 10 days.  An antihistamine, like tablet Loratadine, can be taken 10 mg twice daily. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines with their consent. A sunscreen is very important to decrease redness. Apply your sunscreen at least twice daily for example at 8 AM and 12 PM. If dandruff is present, a Ketoconazole-based shampoo may be used twice a week. You can follow up after two to three weeks. Good luck.

How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months).

As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses.

After a complete kidney workup, he said that they were functioning well. But, he changed my hypertension medicine from Lisinopril to Losartan and discontinued my diuretics. As a result, my sodium level came up to the normal range. During the two-month time frame, I felt that Losartan made me very anxious, and I noticed hot flushes, which I never experienced before. My blood pressure was fluctuating, but he refused to put me back on Lisinopril, which I had taken for nine years. At this week's follow-up visit, I told him about the flushes and my blood pressure. I also have a white coat syndrome and get very nervous when I go there, causing my face to go red. He then said I might have carcinoid syndrome and wants me to take a 24-hour urine test. I researched this for days, on the internet, and I have no other symptoms of this syndrome, except for the flushing and uncontrolled blood pressure, which I never had until he changed my medications. I want your opinion as I am very upset and scared that I may have this syndrome.

She had taken my blood sample and it was negative. But, still I have not gotten my periods and it has been a week ahead. What could be the reason for my late periods?","Doctor":"Hello. As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses.

I cheated on my wife and I am really scared that I may have HIV. When I say scared, I mean night terrors, huge anxiety, and no appetite (lost 15 pounds in three weeks). I cannot work and it is all I think about. The circumstances are as follows. I performed oral sex on a female. I then fingered her and then masturbated myself with the same hand. I have asked a few professionals and they say I am only at risk theoretically but have no real risk of contracting HIV. However, my body tells me differently. I have had a sore throat for 20 days, no appetite, pain where my liver and spleen are, weakness in my legs that come and go and a hint of nausea every now and then. I have night sweats that awaken me but they are accompanied by panic. My heart feels like it is going to burst. My tongue and mouth burn, but I think that is acid-related because my breath is awful, no matter how much I brush. I had an Alere combo HIV test at 25 days and that was negative. I have never had a fever, rash, swollen nodes, or any of the common symptoms. My questions are what is my real risk of contracting HIV? The health department said I do not need to retest and that 25 days was enough time for accurate results with that type of test. Is that true? Could this all be anxiety and guilt?","Doctor":"Hello.

My creatine ~1.25, eGFR ~63. I am currently on 30 mg Lisinopril, 12.5 mg Hydrochlorothiazide daily. Most recently I changed to (6 months ago), taking 40 mg Lisinopril only and noticed bp increasing so added the HCT. Since starting HCT, hypernatremic @ NA=130. My query is I get a rapid spike in blood pressure over the course of two to three days from well-controlled 130/80 mmHg to 165/105 mmHg which has maintained for the last seven days and continues. What are the possible causes of such a rapid sustained spike?","Doctor":"Hello. The causes of this accelerated phase could be multiple. Is there any change in dietary habit with increased salt intake? Any recent change in antihypertensive? Did you by any chance miss antihypertensive medications? Any consumption of pain killer NSAIDs (nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs)? If none of this is true sometimes it could be just because of variation in weather with winters starting. My advice will be to continue with Lisinopril as advised. As HCTZ (hydrochlorothiazide) is causing hyponatremia I will stop that and can add Tolvaptan which has been approved specially for ADPKD (autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease). This has to be done by your nephrologist though. For better control of BP add Amlodipine 5 mg once daily and monitor blood pressure. Please note that a common cause of hyponatremia in such a scenario is increased water intake, salt restriction, reduced protein intake and hydrochlorothiazide. Combination of these factors is common in ADPKD patients as doctors would be advising for all these."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, Recently, I had undergone chest X-ray, ECG, creatinine, fasting glucose, postprandial blood sugar, urea, uric acid, lipid profile, liver function test, thyroid stimulating hormone, TSH, urine complete analysis, complete blood count with ESR and ultrasound of abdomen and pelvis.

I contacted my doctor immediately and he suggested to go for urine culture and sensitivity. The report came after three days and it looks normal as well. It says, no growth noticed at the end of 48 hours of incubation and microscopic examination says occasional pus cells and no microorganisms were seen. The doctor said not to worry and that everything is alright. He suggested taking more water. He also mentioned that the ultrasound report is also normal. I searched on the internet about RBCs in the blood and saw some very strange articles which scared me a lot. I request you to kindly help me out and suggest what I should do.","Doctor":"Hello. According to your reports, it seems to be a urinary tract infection secondary to a kidney stone. Some kidney stones are not visible on the ultrasound. So, I suggest you do a CT scan of the abdomen and repeat urinalysis. If the same report persists, then we can think of nephrolithiasis.

How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

I began having knee problems at the age of 15 (my mother’s problems began in her knees at the age of 13) and the problems remained there for a few years. In the last three to four years my symptoms have massively progressed to my hands, fingers, shoulders, hips, toes, and ankles making daily chores quite painful. It sounds silly but when the blood tests came back and did show inflammation I was bizarre, pleased. I had been made to feel like I was over-exaggerating a lot so to have it proven was one step in the right direction. The private doctor I saw was the one that recommended medication. I take Celebrex 200 mg in the morning with 15 mg Lansoprazole as previous medication has upset my stomach. This medication seemed to be working until eight months ago. My blood tests showed my inflammation levels rising again. Recent stressful situations have, I think caused quite a bad flare and I am taking Paracetamol more religiously than I would usually. Small tasks like doing a jigsaw were causing my shoulder to ache. I recently got a new set of blood tests done and the results, along with results from the last 1.5 years have been included. I would appreciate any advice you can give me. I also hand scans of my knees and hips done. The scans came back showing effusion in my knees, I was told it is nothing to worry about at the moment as the fluid buildup is at a level that could be absorbed back in by the body. If it were to get worse though, I was told I would need it drained manually. My hip scans came back normal but at the time of the scan my hips had only been part of the problem for maybe a year whereas my knees had been bad for the best part of 10 years. I am getting frustrated with myself because of my inability to do simple tasks some days. I know it is no fault of my own but that does not help when your only 28 and cannot wash the dishes or mop the floor because something will start hurting and I will have to stop. I have also progressed quite badly with hand issues. I have had occasions where my left wrist and hand will start shaking. I have also regularly found myself dropping things like pans, cups, my cell phone, my medication among other things. My left side of my body has always been worse than my right side although my right side is slowly catching up. I am unsure whether to mention my condition while looking for future work. At the moment it is not preventing me from working. I have had to occasionally, wear braces on my knees or wrists and my current job is aware that if I am sitting down in class it is medically necessary. I am aware that compared to some people my inflammation levels, when looking purely at bloodwork are very low but the actual pain I am in is very real and I would very much like some advice on how to proceed. Primarily, I am looking for a more effective way to manage my pain levels so I can get back to doing more things typical of a 28-year-old rather that sit with a hot water bottle on my back and Paracetamol at the ready. I have attached a blood tets.","Doctor":"Hi. I have gone through your query and blood reports. (attachment removed to protect patient identity).  I do have a few queries to help you reach the correct diagnosis. I want to be really sure we are dealing with inflammatory arthritis and so we can modify your medicines accordingly as Celebrex 200 would not be a solution for a long term. Do you experience early morning stiffness and swelling? If yes for how long? Are these pains intermittent in nature or persistent? How is the sleep pattern? Do you have early morning fatigue as if you did not sleep well? Any recent complaints of irritability and forgetfulness? Any persistent headaches? Any bowel upsets like increased frequency of stools?

As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves.

I usually have a white discharge. Now my major problem is that for the past one month, I started to have irritation in my vaginal area. I checked in the mirror, and it was red. I do not know whether the vagina is normally red or not. But for some days in the evening, or after meals I used to feel a burning sensation. Initially, I thought they were because of spices in food. But one night, I felt like I had constipation and intense burning, and I felt like sitting on the toilet for the whole time. Now, yesterday the burning started in the morning without having any food. Sometimes, I feel the pain in one nerve from the stomach to the vagina, and sometimes I feel like my uterus is filled with gas, and sometimes it hurts under the stomach and above the vagina. Yesterday evening I went to a gynecologist. She gave me the AF kit and Candid ointment to apply. First, I did not know how to use it, and due to shyness, I did not ask as well. After coming home, I was in great pain due to burning in the vagina, so I decided to apply it. When I was struggling to apply it, I found thorn-like sharp things near the vaginal opening. I felt them, although they are not visible in the mirror. I could feel as if multiple needles are there. The skin is that way. I am tensed about the sharp things. Please tell me what they are. Are they normal? Please suggest me about my condition. How to use these creams? What are the possible reasons for the infections? I have changed my panty brand and bought a cheaper one this time. Can this be the cause of the infection?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing?

How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

I had been diagnosed to have GAD and social phobia before 10 years, and I was taking Paxil 20 mg daily in the evening along with CBT. The result was excellent. The anxiety and depression went away, but with a very high level of weight gain, significant fatigue and some sexual dysfunction (low libido). Due to the side effects of the drug, I tried to withdraw it all together around two years back, and there was a relapse. Therefore, I have come back to the medication with some changes. Initially, my doctor replaced Paxil with Prozac and Wellbutrin XL, and then replaced Prozac with Zoloft. Wellbutrin had many side effects on me. Hence, I avoided it altogether. He also avoided Effexor. I am currently on Zoloft 50 mg in the evening along with Buspar 10 mg four times daily. The query now is, which of the following strategies will have few side effects like fatigue, weight gain, impotence, decreased libido, and to delay the ejaculation? A combination of 20 mg Prozac during the evening time along with Buspar 10 mg every six hours daily. A combination of 10 mg Lexapro in the evening along with Buspar 10 mg every six hours a day. A combination of 50 mg Zoloft every evening along with Buspar 10 mg every six hours daily. How would you arrange the side effects? I would like you to mention the side effects regarding impotence, libido, weight gain, fatigue, drowsiness, negative impact on the system and liver in long-term usage, control GAD, SAD and social shyness, delayed ejaculation as a positive side effect, interfere with food, other medicines and supplements etc., in a descending order. Please discuss every question in detail according to your practical experience. Best regards.","Doctor":"Hi. I read your query. Out of the three options, the third option would be the best possible concerning the balance between the effectiveness and side effects. Zoloft (Sertraline) and Lexapro (Escitalopram), both are almost equal regarding the side effects and efficacy. Based on my experience, Prozac (Fluoxetine) is a weaker drug regarding the effectiveness. With my practical experience, impotence and loss of libido are known side effects of all the three drugs. The probability may vary but, it is about 10 to 20 %. Lexapro is the most drug to cause weight gain when compared to Zoloft and Prozac. Again, fatigue and drowsiness are known to occur with all the three medicines. But, it is more familiar with Lexapro. Delayed ejaculation is not a predictable side effect. Hence, cannot say among the three. Zoloft and Lexapro do not interfere with almost all the medicines, whereas, Prozac may do so. The long-term impact on the body and liver is almost negligible for all the three. They are all safe on a long run. The effectiveness of control on SAD (seasonal affective disorder), GAD (generalized anxiety disorder), and social shyness is better with Zoloft and Lexapro compared to Prozac. Between the two (Zoloft and Lexapro) it is hard to judge. Some patients benefit more on Lexapro and some on Zoloft. To conclude, I reiterate that, based on the information you have provided, the third option is the best among the three. (Zoloft 50 mg with Buspirone 10 mg, every six hours). With best wishes.

He had some standard vaccinations and a routine CBC to check for lead level and anemia. The CBC came back with high WBC and high platelets. His pediatrician was not concerned and said it could be from a recent infection or from the vaccines, etc. To ease my concerns, she offered to retest and we did so. She added markers for inflammation and ferritin level. The WBC has gone down but the platelets are still high. I have attached the CBC results and differentials from three different dates. The ferritin level was 34 (standard 17 to 168 ng/ml) and ESR was 9 mm/hr (standard 0 to 10 mm/hr). So, both were within the normal range. The pediatrician is still not concerned but will send a message to her hematology colleague to verify. I am awaiting the response. Does his report look concerning to you? I am worried it is an early sign of cancer. The lymphocytes are still high despite the overall WBC being within the normal range. Also, eosinophils are high. I see in the differential it shows various abnormal cell shapes such as poikilocytosis, elliptocytes, microcytes, and anisocytosis.

Thank you.","Doctor":"Hello. It is good to see that you are aware of your child's health. I have seen the reports (attachment removed to protect patient identity). Let me give you my opinion. Do not directly conclude it as a malignancy, especially leukemia. In the peripheral smear, no blast cells or other abnormal premature cells are mentioned, which is usually seen in acute leukemia. So, the absence of these cells favors an infective or inflammatory etiology. Microcytic indicates a small RBC while poikilocyte means a variation in the shape of RBC. These changes are not suggestive of a malignancy. Your child's absolute lymphocyte count is going down. This suggests a recovery from an inflammation. Lymphocytes are usually high in a newborn or in case of a viral inflammation. So, I do not think you have to jump over to the possibility of a malignancy. Check your child's liver. If they are enlarged, he needs further work up. If still after a few days, the absolute counts go up, you can investigate further with flow cytometry if needed. You can take the opinion of a hematologist and get your child examined by him or her and you can discuss the information provided to you. Hope I have addressed your query. Take care.

This is a common problem that most of the new mothers face at this point of time. First of all sit back and relax, do not take too much of stress. Because stress is going to affect the quantity and quality of breast milk. Proper latching is essential for both you and your child to feel comfortable during feeding. First sit in a chair comfortably leaning your back with good support. Lift your baby and hold him near your breast. You can keep pillows below the baby to achieve the height without much weight over your hands. When your baby opens its mouth, You have to put the nipple and the areola around it inside the mouth. Search for breast feeding photos or videos online and you can very well understand it. Amount of breastmilk secretion depends upon various factors. Important one is demand. If you feed the baby often the whole day today, definitely your secretion will start to increase from the next day as your body will sense the demand and produce more milk. Feed minimum once every 2 hours in the day and once every 3 to 4 hours in the night. Keep hydrated. Drink atleast 3 to 4 litres of water per day as 80 % of breastmilk is water. Take balanced diet.

Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations. If the size and number of cysts are more, then I suggest consulting a gynecologist as you may require surgery.

As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves.

Looking at the photo you have sent (attachment removed to protect patient identity), it is very clear that you do not have any lesions in the throat which cause a suspicion of malignancy (cancer) to arise. The reddish line you are looking at is nothing but the dilation of blood vessels which is clinically known as congestion and it is always seen in a throat infection. You seem to have suffered from acute pharyngitis which is a common type of throat infection wherein the symptoms would be throat pain, referred ear pain and sometimes reactive lymph node enlargement in the throat. There is also a chance that you might have developed an ulcer in the area of the tonsils (which is removed already in your case), which also causes persistent unilateral throat pain. You can gargle with an antiseptic mouthwash for a few days and continue taking over-the-counter analgesics till your pain subsides. A ten-day history of throat pain with a lymph node enlargement is usually inflammatory and not a sign or symptom of malignancy. So, you need not worry about throat cancer unless there is an ulcerative (non-healing) lesion lasting for a few months without resolution even after treatment.

I am concerned about my menstrual cycle. About two weeks ago, I noticed spotting in my underwear. It went on for two and a half days.

Last week, I felt slight cramping, and I was quite sure that my period would start, but it did not. On the same week that the spotting happened, my boyfriend and I were intimate. He was rubbing my genitals very very roughly, but we did not have sex. He did not even stick his finger in me. I am still a virgin.

Also, I would experience some nausea and diarrhea. The bleeding is somewhat heavy. I cannot remember if I have ever had a light period. My periods are sometimes irregular. But, they go back to normal by themselves. They would be late by a maximum of a couple of days or a week.

As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves.

Now, you have got your periods you can start trying for conception.

Thanks.","Doctor":"Hi. I have seen her reports (attachment removed to protect patient identity). In your mom's case, considering that she is a diabetic patient with swelling in both her feet (also known as edema), a few things come to my mind. She could be having some skin infection in the swollen legs. And to fight this infection, the body mounts a response in the form of increased number of neutrophils to fight the infection. I am worried why she has this swelling in the first place. She could be having high blood pressure or hypertension or early signs of heart failure. Diabetes is also known to cause kidney problems that can result in water retention in the body and resultant leg edema. Diabetes and kidney issues, can themselves increase the risk for infection, especially in elderly patients. Renal injury because of diabetes can lead to anemia of the type mentioned in your mom's peripheral blood smear test.

In search of this internal bleed, my mother was asked to drink a gallon of bowel flushing solution. She drank two-thirds of the solution, but was told that she had not had enough to do the colonoscopy, so the test was put off till the next day. She was asked to drink another gallon of this solution. All the barium solution caused a blockage causing her to puff up, which went unnoticed when they performed a colonoscopy. They did not find any damage to her colon, so after determining that the bleed must have been in her small intestine, they attempted to do a barium follow, in which they found a blockage just outside her stomach. The barium has now been in her stomach for three days. How long can she go like this before it becomes a serious life threatening condition?

How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

I understand your concerns and would to let you know that lattice degeneration is a symptomatic condition. That is to say that lattice degeneration by itself will not cause any symptoms whatsoever. To put it very simply, lattice degeneration is an area of thinning in the retina (the nerve which helps you see). If left alone there are chances that this weak area would give way and tear lead to a serious condition called retinal detachment. Most doctors leave lattices along but sometimes they will have to be lasered. As far as your other symptoms, please continue with your migraine medication. For the sensation of floaters and streaks of light please keep follow ups with your ophthalmologist at least once every year. I am not very convinced about what you have mentioned about light sources being burned, although this is a very common normal condition we see in normal people, I doubt that it would last as long as 10 minutes.

Scarred kidney is due to infection, that should be left apart. SUFE and (PCOS) polycystic ovaries syndrome have hormonal causes, for which you will need extensive endocrinological evaluation. You should get the following tests done: Anyway if you are visiting endocrinologist, then he will definitely order all these investigations. You also mentioned about anemia, if still have it, then you will need investigations for that, like serum iron studies, vitamin B12, and folic acid levels. Do you have blackish foul smelling stools? If yes, then you need to get occult blood testing. Hope this helps you, and get back if you have any doubts.

Overall, she is fine as per the latest check-up. After six months of breastfeed, she was started on solid foods as per the following schedule: 8 to 9 AM - cerelac wheat, 12 to 1 PM - rice, dhal, vegetable, 4 to 5 PM - fruit juice (orange or pomegranate) or smashed banana and biscuits  7 to 8 PM - roti, dhal, vegetable. After a month, she will start taking fish. I request your help regarding a couple of issues. She is extremely reluctant to take any fruit juice or banana, although she is too comfortable with the biscuits. If we try to give her the juice, she cries to the extent that everybody at home gets afraid and finally gives up. Is there a way to make her take juices?

Now I am pregnant of six weeks and do not want to continue so I take an abortion kit but after taking all four Misoprostol pills bleeding not started yet and it is almost 24 hours gone. What to do now? Do I have life threatening risk? I am worried.","Doctor":"Hi. You need to do one ultrasound scan to confirm the pregnancy. If you had done scan before taking pills then wait for 12 days and if no bleeding then repeat ultrasound scan. And if you did not do ultra scan then get it done. You should bleed. But if not then either you had wrong pills or pills did not work. And will require surgical abortion. You need to consult a nearby gynecologist or abortion center. One rare chance is to have an ectopic pregnancy if you did not do an ultrasound scan. But if it was there then you should have more pain in the lower abdomen on one side. It will clear in the next ultra scan. In that case, treatment may vary. After bleeding starts you should take Rh anti D 150 ug injection within 72 hours because we do not know the fetus blood group. Do drink more water. And if you did not do ultrasound scan then you can repeat the urine pregnancy test also. Because sometimes kits also come faulty and give false-positive results.

To give you some context, I went abroad for studies, and I felt extremely lonely and miserable there. After a year, I was suffering from sleep problems. However, one day, I had confusing thoughts, just before I went to sleep. For some reason, I became convinced that I had a mental illness, and I began researching my symptoms. My condition also declined. I began to feel detached from everyone and everything around me, and I felt like I was losing touch with reality. This went on for some months. However, during this time, I felt fine when I was in the company of others, and therefore longed to be with people and talk to them. I gave my exams, even rejoined a job, which I had left to do my masters. There are periods when I feel completely fine. But, there are periods when I feel terrible. I am having the following symptoms. Whatever dreams I have, I tend to remember and notice them more. I could be dreaming about my old house or someone. So when I wake up, these dreams cause me to feel uncomfortable, like maybe I will lose my grip on reality. Whenever I see or meet a person I have dreamt about, I get an uncomfortable, unpleasant feeling and a memory of the dream. This makes me afraid that maybe I will be unable to distinguish between dreams and reality. I get mental images and thoughts of memories or things I dreamt about. This gives a very unpleasant feeling. For the past few days, I am getting strong mental images of faces of people whenever I talk to them or think about them or see them. For instance, I would be thinking of someone, and I will have a strong mental image of their face. I would be talking to someone, and a different mental image of their face would pop up. I am really scared about this. Why am I getting mental images of everything like this? I feel depressed and sad that I will lose control, and that I will go crazy. At times, I am confused and not able to process things properly. I have also started feeling scared and petrified for no reason. I get a sinking and nervous feeling in my chest. My hands shake at times, and I feel like I will lose control. This has been happening for the past 10 months. Are my worst fears true? Do I have a mental illness?","Doctor":"Hi.

How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases.

For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations. If the size and number of cysts are more, then I suggest consulting a gynecologist as you may require surgery.

As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses.

Pylori, if it was a stool antigen test or a breath test (rarely done) or a serum test. Given that you mentioned, it came out positive, anyways you need to take a H.Pylori eradication kit, which includes 2 antibiotics along with a PPi plus one more agent (depending on physicians preference). As you are on 2 weeks of antibiotics, you should get your self-tested again for H.Pylori with stool antigen test. If it is negative you do not need to take anymore antibiotics otherwise you will need another 10 days of different set of antibiotics or you can take 2 more weeks of antibiotics and repeat test again. But the symptoms you are having might not get better with H.Pylori eradication, they might be due to acid reflux which is totally different from H.Pylori. You should get your self evaluated with an upper GI endoscopy and rule out GERD.

If you have frequent respiratory tract infections. You may be transmitting the viruses and bacteria to your vagina, unknowingly. When you sneeze or cough into your palm,later when you wash your genital area after using the washroom, you will transfer respiratory infections to vaginal tract. To correct this issue,use a good course of antibiotics like Cap.Moxacillin+ Clavalunate 625 mg twice daily for 1 week. Also wash hands with soap before using washroom.  3. If you are diabetic. Check your blood sugar levels- fasting and post prandial. Only after correction, problem will be solved.  4. If you are sexually active, infection from partner could be the reason.

And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases. Because, it is a volatile compound and causes vapors entering the lungs through the airways. 3. As it was only two drops, I do not think it may cause much trouble.

For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations. If the size and number of cysts are more, then I suggest consulting a gynecologist as you may require surgery.

As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses.

Unfortunately, the Mescline did not make me feel better. I think my issue is that my eustacian tubes are clogged and need to be drained. How can I do this? Is there a medicine?","Doctor":"Hi. Ear blocking sensation with vertigo for five weeks especially if it is bilateral is unlikely to be due to eustachian tube dysfunction. Eustachian tube dysfunction in general does not cause significant vertigo unless there is associated infection of middle ear or fluid in the middle ear. Since you do not have pain, it iis unlikely to be due to infection of middle ear. So possible cause can be fluid in the middle ear (glue ear) which is usually due to long standing eustachian tube dysfunction. Most of the times it is a self resolving condition. Treatment for this condition is symptomatic with anti-vertigo medicines such as Cinnarazine or Betahistine taken every day for a week. For fluid in the middle ear you can use decongestant nose sprays such as Oxymetazoline or Xylometazoline. Steam inhalation two times daily also can be beneficial. If these medicines do not work, then detailed examination of ear for inner ear dysfunction and hearing tests such as Pure Tone Audiogram and Tympanogram may be required."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am a 25 year old female, and I am trying to conceive for the last 1.5 years.

My father is asthmatic and I had wheezing when I was a kid (2-3 years of age). We were residing in an area where the industrial pollution is very high and he used to get wheezing more frequently there. In the less polluted parts, incidences of wheezing was much lesser. We shifted to another city 3 years back and the city is highly polluted. The weather here also is very erratic like dull, cloudy, occasional rains and sunny in between. My son had several incidences of wheezing initially though it was never serious to get him admitted. We have a nebulizer at home. We used to give him asthalin before, but now it is either Levolin or Budecort or a mixture of both for nebulization when wheezing is bad. My son was given Omnacortil forte syrup and tablet (10 mg - two tablets per day) for the first time last month. The duration of medication was for 5 days. This year the weather here has been very bad and hence incidences of wheezing have been higher. As per the advice of the doctor, we give him Budecort 50 mg inhaler twice a day as a preventive measure (for 2-3 months in winter but this time in monsoon too) and Levolin inhaler two puffs each 3-4 times a day as and when needed. We have been doing this for more than a year now. This time during the period of wheezing, he complained of chest pain for the first time. We noticed that when we gave him inhaler, the pain reduced. The doctor told that it is related to wheezing and there is nothing to worry. Still we got the chest x-ray done and he is fine. But he regularly used to complain of the chest pain, especially when he stood for long in assemblies. Sometimes we felt that he was making it up to draw attention/to escape studies. Now the weather is warmer and he is fine and there is no trace of chest pain. My younger son who is six years also has had wheezing instances but only 3 times during the past 3-4 years. We also give him Budecort 50 mg inhaler now twice a day. Please suggest a routine management for wheezing. Secondly, should we try to find out any other possible heart problem for chest pain? Thirdly, is it fine to give Budecort continuously/intermittently for 4-5 months in a year at a dosage of 100mg per day?","Doctor":"Hi. First of all, I am replying to your main 3 questions as follows:1. Routine management of wheezing: 2. Should we try to find out possible heart problem for chest pain? 3.

How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

I will provide you the outline of management in your case, however, actual changes in treatment regimen should be done after discussing with treating doctor. Firstly, your heart looks alright with no evidence of blockages, however, blood pressure is an issue which needs to be taken care of. You are started on Ramipril, but you should check it frequently at home as 2.5 mg alone less likely to completely normalize your BP. So if home BP remains elevated more than 140/90 mmHg after 2.5 mg Ramipril then it has to make twice daily. Next regarding sugar, it is not very well controlled especially post meals. Now I do not know whether you were tried initially on any medications or not, if not then medications should be tried. Now, Metformin is a basic and most important medication for it. So, you should discuss with your doctor regarding initiating it. Also, you will need add on drugs as Metformin alone will not be sufficient, which includes Teneliglipitin and Glimepiride which comes in combination of Metformin. If medications are not feasible at the moment, then dose of bolus insulin which is delivered with each meals should be increased by two units, in order to take care of post meals surge. So that you are able to have proper diet. Also, regarding pains, it is likely a neuropathy due to deranged sugars. For that, sugars should be tightly controlled and you will need supplements like Neurobion forte once daily. If this does respond to multivitamin supplements then you will need nerve stabilizers like Pregabalin, etc. Also, your triglycerides level is too much elevated, for that you need to have a healthy lifestyle like avoiding fatty oily foods. Have regular exercises like brisk walking for at least 30 minutes a day. This will also bring your sugar level down. Also, you will need medications here to control triglycerides like tablet Fenofibrate 145 mg bedtime daily for eight weeks. There are some issues and there is good scope for improvement. Also, you should undergo TMT(treadmill test) at regular intervals of three to four years. Also, considering your family history of heart disease, it is better you also undergo CT (computed tomography) coronary angiography once as it has got very high sensitivity and can tell us if even minute blockages and preventive medications can be started.

How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

Hope you and your dear ones are safe and healthy. From your history, I gather that you have two problems. Delayed period and lower abdominal pain and cramps. For the delayed period, I see your body weight could be a reason. With a height of 152 cm, your expected weight is 52-55 kg. The extra fat, cholesterol can get converted into hormones and cause an imbalance of hormones needed for normal ovulation. Thus due to impaired ovulation, period will be delayed on and off. At present to have period, take any of the birth control pills, packet of 21 pills (ones used for contraception) twice daily for 10 days. No matter what the reason is, you will have periods within 7-10 days after the last pill. Through good dieting, not fasting, and proper work out reduce your weight. Weight loss of just 5 kg is enough to correct hormone imbalance. About pain in the lower abdominal area and during sex, there could be two reasons. a. Pelvic infection in and around the uterus. Infections enter with semen. Symptoms are vaginal dryness during sex, burning sensation in vagina after sex, pain throughout which increases around the time of ejaculation, following day excessive vaginal discharge with or without itching and foul smell. Similar discharge just before period. Period blood is darker, thicker and stickier. Mild feverish feel before period. Cramping pains just before period. If this is the case, avoid sex, meet your doctor at leisure, both you and your partner should have a good course of antibiotics. It will get fully resolved. b. Endometriosis due to blood causing adhesive areas around uterus, increasing over the months and years. But I do not think you could be having this. Both these need medical help.

Since then, the swelling has gone down, but my joint is bruised, it hurts to bend it, tender to touch, and when I did accidentally bend it, it felt like a grinding sensation in it. Do you think I ruptured my volar plate and had an avulsion fracture? I am just worried. What would they do to treat it? I go back in tomorrow morning for the x-rays. Can you please help soothe my mind? They did splint it.","Doctor":"Hi.

How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

He vomited and had lot of salt water. Please advice for any side effect.","Doctor":"Hi. I want to assure you not to worry as everything is going to be fine if proper care and treatment is opted in for. I have thoroughly gone through your case and can well understand your genuine health concerns. 1. No, there is not much problem right now as he vomited and also had a lot of water. It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases. Because, it is a volatile compound and causes vapors entering the lungs through the airways. 3. As it was only two drops, I do not think it may cause much trouble. If he feels short of breath contact me back, otherwise fine. 1. He should avoid re-exposure. 2.

For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations. If the size and number of cysts are more, then I suggest consulting a gynecologist as you may require surgery. If the number and size of cysts are less, you may continue treatment along with syrup Evecare 10 ml BD and Kanchnar Guggulu two BD.

She had taken my blood sample and it was negative. But, still I have not gotten my periods and it has been a week ahead. What could be the reason for my late periods?","Doctor":"Hello. As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses.

This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations. If the size and number of cysts are more, then I suggest consulting a gynecologist as you may require surgery. If the number and size of cysts are less, you may continue treatment along with syrup Evecare 10 ml BD and Kanchnar Guggulu two BD.

As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses.

As far as small cysts are concerned they are unmatured eggs which failed to induce menstrual cycle previously, as a result, they got collected in the ovary and they will remain in the ovary. Now, you have got your periods you can start trying for conception. But I advise you to do it under the supervision of a nearby gynecologist because egg size is important while conception and that you can know by ovulation study.

How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals.

After a week the fever stopped, and for a week everything was fine (except our son feeling weak). After that symptoms of allergy and red stains on his arms and legs appeared, which matched the definition of parvovirus indeed, as his treating physician confirmed. These symptoms disappeared after 2 days, but now his fever is back to 38.1 degrees Celsius, which worries us. Let me sum it up: 1-7 days - fever up to 39 degrees Celsius which reduced by Noraphen. 8-14 days - no fever. 15-16 days - allergic response. 17th day - fever is back. I have attached the entire report. Kindly advice.","Doctor":"Hello. I have gone through your son's history and the report (attachment removed to protect patient's identity), and would like to make my suggestions and comments about him as follows:As per your description, the clinical picture very much matches that of a viral infection, borderline report of IgM parvovirus and itchy rash increase the possibility that it may be actually parvovirus infection.So far I would reasonably agree with the treatment that your son has received. Treatment of most viral infections is treatment of symptoms only,  Paracetamol for fever, antihistamines for cough and cold and other conservative measures. There is no specific treatment for many viral infections and most of the viral infections recover by themselves if the child's immunity is normal.The pattern of fever that you have described is known as \\"biphasic fever\\" pattern. This is commonly seen in many viral infections, where initial high fever is followed by a period with no fever which is followed by a second period of fever. It is important to note that fever during the second period is lower than that in the first period and also the second period is short lasting when compared to the first period.Considering this pattern, I would suggest you not to worry too much. But of course be cautious and monitor temperature of your son. As current fever (38.1) is lower than that in the first week (39), it could be a pattern of the viral infection. However, if the fever rises to the same or high (39 or more than 39) or  if it lasts longer or if your son develops any new symptom, I would suggest you to get your son examined by his paediatrician again. In that case, his doctor would examine him again and may think of a complication or alternative diagnosis. Currently, I would suggest him Paracetamol for control of fever along with adequate fluids to maintain hydration as well as adequate rest. I would like to mention here that rest and hydration are the most important aspects of treatment of any viral infection."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, About two weeks ago, I noticed a cut in the glans area of my penis, on the underside, just below the end of the meatus. It was bleeding a little bit, which I guess was brought upon by the starting of intercourse. Upon looking closely, I also noticed some white deposits on the glans felt like wet tissue paper which rolled off with soap and water. As I was travelling, I did a quick check with my GP, who suggested applying an antibiotic ointment. He also suggested seeing a urologist in case it did not get alright by the time I get back. Over the next few days, I applied the ointment and washed the penis regularly, as the smegma, which is what I am assuming after checking online, was still there. After about five days, it started looking clean and the cut seemed healed. Also, I was able to get back to intercourse. Over the next 10 days or so, I probably had intercourse about four times and there was no problem. Well, there was a slight occasional itch sometimes. The smegma seemed to come back to some extent, if I skipped cleaning any particular day, but if I washed regularly, then it was fine. The last night, I had intercourse and there was some discomfort at first, but it went away. Later, I noticed a significant amount of blood. There was a cut in pretty much the same place as before and there had been a lot of bleeding from that. When I checked closely, there was some smegma again. I am still traveling.

Audiometry at that day was normal of the right ear. Next day, there was a slight discharge from the left ear. Two three days later, she had heaviness, which was fine after 2 to 3 days. During the time, she visited home, and on 12th, the heaviness of the head appeared again. So, we visited the ENT again, who extended the treatment for five more days. On 16th, she felt buzzing sound in the right ear also, and we visited another ENT.

But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

The fluid has been drained and there was blood mixed with the fluid. The regular blood test came back normal with no sign of cancerous cells. My question is, what are the chances that the tumors are benign? Through my research, there is a good chance that the tumors could be a rhabdomyoma. My daughter is only 9 years old and I want to take her to the best facility. They said her heart is weak and are unable to perform any test on the tumors. They have her on Coretec and albumin and said that it was not working and put her on something stronger. Could this be a result of the pericardial effusion? I am attaching the blood test reports. They said everything was normal with no sign of cancerous cells, but are still unable to say for certain if it is benign or malignant.  I am just a very worried father.","Doctor":"Hello. Firstly, there is a diagnostic dilemma. The reports you have uploaded (attachment removed to protect patient identity) are fine. But, you should upload the echo reports and the fluid investigations as well. Now, considering the pericardial effusion with multiple cardiac tumors, the possibilities of a rhabdomyoma or a teratoma are high. However, an effusion is not common with rhabdomyoma. It is possible to have some other cause for the effusion and it can also be as a result of a heart failure. Both of these are benign tumors. However, at this stage, we cannot rule out a malignancy. The next thing to be done is that she should undergo a cardiac MRI for further characterization of the lesions, which will give us a diagnosis and also resolve the issue of malignancy. Also, if the fluid is available, it should be tested for ADA (adenosine deaminase) and GeneXpert. She should also undergo a thyroid test. Rhabdomyomas usually occurs in patients with tuberous sclerosis, so she should be adequately examined by the doctor for the same. A definitive treatment is the excision of these tumors surgically. So, you can discuss this with the doctor as well. Hope this helps you. Do write back in case of doubts.

How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off.

Then we had sex after 15 days of her periods and I did not ejaculate inside her but still no period. Would she be pregnant?","Doctor":"Hi. Considering that her withdrawal bleed after the morning after pill would have started, so this shall become her fresh menstrual date and if her cycles had been regular and 28-30 days cycle then by the time you had sex she would be in her fertile period or in her ovulation period. So, having unprotected sex during this time, even though you ejaculated outside, still the chances of precum inside her vagina remains. Precum contains live sperms and hence there may be a chance that she may get pregnant. So, the best way to rule out pregnancy at present would be to get a serum beta hCG test. If the hCG levels less than 5 ng/dL, that indicates negative result and she is not pregnant. In that case, the deal in menses is due to the morning after pill as it is a side effect. Menses shall resume in next few days and one can wait safely. So, at present please get a serum beta hCG test done.

If she is 8 weeks and 5 days gestation as of today and still there has been no heartbeat or a fetal pole, then it is likely to be an anembryonic gestation or a chemical pregnancy with just the gestational sac. If the fetal pole and the heartbeat have not arrived till now, then it is unlikely that it would arrive.

How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases.

For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations.

As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves.

I suggest trying Fibroease on a low dosage and monitor the severity of bleeding. If there is massive and continuous bleeding, Fibroease dosage should be reduced further.

Please diagnose and suggest medicine.","Doctor":"Hello.  We are happy to help you. I understand that you have these complaints for a few years. It most probably is a manifestation of allergic rhinitis. The total IgE in serum is just an indication of the allergy status at the time of taking the blood sample. It is not very significant in allergy practice. Nevertheless, it shows that you have an allergy. You need some medicines to keep allergy under wraps and prevent the blockage and cold.

So, kindly advice me about which is the best option.","Doctor":"Hello. From your photos (attachment removed to protect patient identity), I can see that you have grade 7 baldness with limited donor hair. But, you have also got small, thinned-out hair in the hair loss area. So my suggestion is as follows. You should understand that the result you can expect is not a head full of hair, but enough hair to cover your baldness. It is a one-day procedure. You can get a 2000-grafts transplant in one session followed by the second session six months later if you want. You will require a review on the third day after the transplant and it can then be followed up online.

Firstly, we have to look for any specific underlying causes for his depression. And then, we have to remove the underlying causes of depression.

How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations.

As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves.

The problem that I am describing below I have been experiencing for the past 10 days or so. I have a more or less constant headache. It is typically on the right part of the forehead, around the hairline and occurring at the center of my head. The pain is not very severe. It is not throbbing or pounding, though the intensity fluctuates at times, it is never very severe. I also experience a vague sensation of nausea, but no vomiting tendency. Sometimes, I get a subtle feeling of dizziness or light-headedness. I am unable to describe it more precisely. It particularly occurs during the head movement. This occurs hardly for a millisecond or so. Also, my eyes feel strained at times while staring at the computer or TV screen About my past health history, I have sinusitis. This was detected two years ago. I had visited an ENT specialist for a throat irritation, for which he got me to do a CT scan of my entire head and neck area. I have not had any treatment for sinusitis except some medication for the first week or so after detection. However, I have not really felt a similar headache earlier. I also tend to catch a cold very easily. On several days, I wake up sneezing which resolves on its own as the day progresses or within a couple of days. In the past week also, I had experienced the same few times. I also developed eye styes on both eyes which were painful and watery. I wear spectacles. The power is (–) 5.25. However, I do not experience blurry or double vision at present. I do not feel any difficulty or loss of balance while walking. I have a habit of walking, and even three days ago, I had walked non-stop for 4 km in about 45 mins but did not experience any difficulty or anything unusual during and after the walking. About a month ago, I had been experiencing for few days a strange stiffness in my lower left leg after walking a small distance, a non-specific back pain, and a vague breathing difficulty. My GP advised me to get a chest X-ray, PFT, echocardiography, and ECG done. All the reports were normal. The problems since then have significantly reduced. I am forgetful by nature. Apart from that, I have not noted any memory loss as such. I have no unusual difficulty in concentrating or thinking clearly. I do not experience any speech problem, but I did notice on one occasion that after speaking continuously for few minutes, I was facing some difficulty in speaking more, but that I believe could have been due to psychological reasons. Exactly five months ago, I had got a CT scan of the brain done on the advice of my GP because I had a severe headache one night few days after accidentally bumping my head on a solid low-height door. However, the results were normal, and nothing was found. Uric acid, blood sugar, creatinine, and TSH have been tested within the past eight months, and the reports were normal. However, lipid profile tests revealed high triglycerides (292) for which I took Rosumac 5 for three months, after which the triglycerides (152) were relatively normal. I have had high BP (140/100) for which I was prescribed Aquazide 12.5, which I am taking. One week ago, I got my BP rechecked, and it was found fairly normal (130/80). I tried steam inhalation yesterday and the day before, but it did not resolve. What could be the possible cause for the headache and the other issues described in the first paragraph? Could this be something serious like a brain tumor? What are the chances of it being any such thing, given that I had a CT scan of the brain only five months ago and everything was normal then? Sorry for the lengthy post. Kindly help.","Doctor":"Hello. A headache can be due to many causes. Few common causes are: In your case, it seems to be either due to the aggravation of sinusitis due to a recent weather change or raised blood pressure. Sinusitis leads to constant secretions within the sinus leading to a headache and nausea. The treatment for sinusitis will definitely improve it. For sinusitis, you can take antibiotics, analgesics, and anti-allergics after a consultation with an ENT specialist. Also, your blood pressure target should be 120/80. Since your CT head is normal, there is no chance of development of brain tumor so quickly. A brain tumor will lead to a constant headache and also other pressure-related symptoms. Thanks.

I have never had any heart issues except palpitations when pregnant 10 years ago. They did a cardiac ultrasound at that time, which was normal. Just over a week ago, I started feeling, intermittently during the day, as if my heart were pounding irregularly. Each time, it lasts just a minute or two and then resolves. I saw my doctor, who heard some skipped beats through the stethoscope. The in-office EKG was normal (I did not feel my chest pounding at that time) as was the bloodwork (CBS, thyroid, and electrolytes). She decided to order a monitor for me, but the office cannot get me in for a month. I was talking to my father-in-law, who has had a number of heart problems, and he recommended, in the meantime, the Kardia monitor, a direct-to-consumer, 1-lead ECG machine (AliveCor). I ordered one of these, and the first test I did was evaluated by their cardiologists as a 'possible atrial fibrillation.' Since then, I have done a number (dozens) of home tests. During the times when my heartbeat feels funny, the algorithm has frequently said 'possible atrial fibrillation' or that it is indeterminate, that is, beyond the bounds of their analysis mechanism. I am not experienced enough to read the strips myself and was hoping I could email a number of the concerning ones to you in a PDF format for an evaluation. The chest sensation is not painful, but it is disconcerting, and I am anxious to get to the bottom of it.

As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses.

A small cystic focus noted in the medial and anterior aspect of the right lobe. What does this mean? Should I be concerned? I was sick with a bad flu about four weeks ago, had a high fever and ended up on antibiotics. Could the lymph nodes still be swollen from that?

How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

As far as small cysts are concerned they are unmatured eggs which failed to induce menstrual cycle previously, as a result, they got collected in the ovary and they will remain in the ovary. Now, you have got your periods you can start trying for conception. But I advise you to do it under the supervision of a nearby gynecologist because egg size is important while conception and that you can know by ovulation study. Ovulation study is performed under the supervision of a gynecologist. For gall stones, surgical intervention is required generally.

I have stopped taking antidepressants for more than eight months as I started feeling well. I drink alcohol occasionally. Is there any chance of anxiety disorder relapsing? Can I drink occasionally?","Doctor":"Hi. It is good that you do not have any symptoms even after stopping the medicines eight months back. There is always a chance that panic disorder and anxiety relapse. So you have to be careful and watchful that if any previous symptoms reappear or any new symptoms arise, then you have to consult your psychiatrist as soon as possible. Alcohol per se does not cause these symptoms if used occasionally and in lower quantity (within safe limit). However, the chances are high if the intake is increased. If you become dependent on it or use more alcohol, then alcohol-related medical conditions can arise and may complicate the situation. Occasional social drinking usually does not cause much problem. Also, do regular follow-ups, so that early sign and symptoms are recognized and dealt accordingly. Thanks and regards.

How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves.

I thought that it is may be due to some excessive spicy food I took the last night and also I did not sleep till late due to some work. So, I just ignored it and left for my work.

Hence, I left with my car driving myself. That pain did not go away rather stayed with me the whole day and by afternoon, it became worse. That day I was so busy and I was almost with empty stomach. So, I had some food and thought it would go away. I felt a little better for some time, but the pain was still there. At evening, I had to admit to a hospital and they gave me medication like Sorbitrate, etc., but the pain was there. I was not fainted, but I felt that I am going to be. The hospital suggested for ICU and when they were taking me there, I suddenly felt fine.

I got angiogram within a week and the report came normal. Now, my problem is, sometimes I feel very little chest pain, which is usually sharp.

I want to assure you, do not worry as everything is going to be fine if proper care and treatment is opted in for.

Try to avoid as much as you can but if unbearable, then it is fine to take. 2. Citrucel (Methylcellulose) dietary fiber supplement. 3.

Your chest x-ray (attachment removed to protect patient identity) and sputum examination are normal, hence, infective etiology is less likely. To rule out any organic cause your work up needed as follows: 1. Auscultation for rhonchi if heard. 2. CBC (complete blood count). 3. Pulmonary function test. (If you have asthma or COPD then PFT will rule out it). 4. EKG for cardiac evaluation. 5. And finally, your calf should be examined. If calf swollen with inflammation is present then D dimer done. From these investigations your diagnosis will be clear. If no organic cause found then panic attack can be considered as etiology for your condition. For doing PFT pulmonologist is needed. So try to make a visit to nearby pulmonologist in another city for examination and doing PFT. If panic attack is the diagnosis (after rule out other causes by the above investigations) then yoga, meditation are beneficial and suitable medication will be started by the psychiatrist."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor,I am trying to conceive but my husband and I did cocaine a week ago.

She had taken my blood sample and it was negative. But, still I have not gotten my periods and it has been a week ahead. What could be the reason for my late periods?","Doctor":"Hello. As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses.

My doctor has given me tablets of Lactum 500 mg and 250 mg. How can I prevent it? Are there any precautions? Please help me.","Doctor":"Hello. I read your query and understand your concerns. I am sorry to inform you that currently, medications are the only effective option to prevent further occurrence of seizures. I am glad to note that there is a response with medication. So, you need to follow the advice of your doctor. In addition, to prevent seizure episodes, the following things should be practiced to the possible extent. Although I am not sure what the dot in your CT scan is, often it represents either tuberculoma or cysticercosis. These two conditions need treatment for a duration of two years or more and many of the individuals get cured over a period of time. I hope this answers you.

While taking medicines, I was feeling fine, and once I stopped them, my symptoms recurred. My present symptoms include indigestion, constipation, improper motions, low appetite, weight loss, inability to gain weight, acne, anal itching, body aches, etc. I have issues with my mind also such as lack of concentration, confusion and other problems. I consulted a neurologist who said my vitamin B12 levels were low. So, I took supplements. Now, after taking those medinces too, I do not feel much of an improvement. In the past, I was affected by worms for around five months. When I took medicines for that, many of my problems got solved. But, digestion issues persist. I consulted a gastro doctor two months back. He said there were no structural problems present and prescribed Cadigut, Acta pro, and Folizorb.

At night, she suddenly started crying as if in pain yesterday and the day before that. Even breast feeding did not help. So, we suspect it could be due to the milk. Her weight was just around 8 kg, which seems to be at the lower limit for her age. That was the reason we started giving cow milk. Should we continue to give cow milk?

How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases.

For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months).

Even at the time of receiving tattoo, the artist used multiple needles in which I saw changing few and missed some. I asked him about needle changing to which he said he did.

Also till now I never had any fever or body pain or infection around the tattoo made.","Doctor":"Hello. Needle can transmit HIV only if the needle was freshly used in another person send the amount of blood collected in the needle is significant. This is because the HIV virus dies very quickly outside the body. In my opinion, the odds of transferring HIV infection in the above scenario are quite less as the chances of both these conditions are present together is very less. It is a good point that you have not had any fever or other symptoms. Testing is being mentioned because we are talking about the worst-case scenario.

It was performed as a normal delivery and again D and C was done within a week due to placenta remains. I had severe vomiting and my food intake was very poor during the pregnancy. Now, I am having issues with whole body weakness and joint and bone pain. The back pain and neck pain are severe. When tested, vitamin D levels were at 11.2 mg. Kindly suggest a remedy. I was asked to take bed rest and I am on calcium tablets. I was working in night shifts but currently on leave after the abortion.","Doctor":"Hello. I just read your query. After an abortion weakness is mainly due to blood loss. So, if you are taking any iron supplementation then continue that. If not, then start taking iron supplements. You can start Ayurvedic medicines for iron supplementation. Take tablet Sapta Amrit Lauh one tablet two times a day with honey after food for one month. Along with this, take a diet rich in iron such as spinach, beans, broccoli, raisins, apricots, peas, iron fortified cereals, pasta, etc., and fruits like apple, banana, peaches, and prunes. As your vitamin D level is below normal and you are advised complete bed rest, it would be difficult for you to expose yourself to sunlight daily. Once you recover, expose yourself to early morning sun rays, because these sun rays lead to chemical reactions in the skin and help in the formation of vitamin D. As you are taking calcium supplements, talk to your specialist regarding taking vitamin D tablets. You have to take these tablets one tablet per week for four consecutive weeks or as your doctor tells you. Along with that, start taking tablet Asthiposhak two tablets twice a day with water after food for four weeks. Do not take both iron and calcium medicines together. Leave some time gap between them. Take foods rich in calcium and vitamin D such as some cereals, orange juice, soy products, cheese, egg yolk (only if you took it earlier), fatty fishes like salmon and tuna (only if you ate fish earlier), mushrooms, yogurt, milk, kale, broccoli, almonds, etc. Sleep adequately for at least for six to eight hours a day. If you are overweight, then after recovery, reduce your weight, because being overweight also causes a low level of vitamin D. Take Lakshadi oil and do a gentle massage of your whole body. After half an hour, take bath with lukewarm water. Do it till the pain subsides. Try all these things regularly, and you will soon feel positive results. Do consult me after ten days regarding improvement. I hope you are satisfied with my answer.

I have started having a visual aura (fortification spectrum) and migraine around two months ago. The aura was almost always on the left side of the vision and the headache (which was quite mild), was on the right side of my head, at the back of my head (occipital area). One day after the migraine, I could feel pain at the back of my head on the right, whenever I leaned forward or shook my head, and then it would go away. I have had around seven episodes so far. Often, between migraine episodes, I also had tension-type headaches which might have been from stress, I do not know. It felt like a bad ache around my head and occasionally, sharp pains in various areas. There was no pain with movement or exertion. I had an MRI (+MRA) one month ago, which found nothing of concern. However, it was done without contrast as they said that the technician decides if the contrast is needed. In the last few days, I have started having this pain at the back of my head, on the left side (not on the right like I have with the migraine), whenever I bend over or strain when bending over. It is around the occipital area and a bit lower as well. I can also feel it when I shake my head. It is a sharp pain. It started after I went to an aerobics class. I have just started working out again. I am not sure if it is related. It has not gone away though, and I can sometimes feel discomfort and slight pain with various movements as well. I am really stressed out about this. I keep having these headaches and these symptoms (aura) which I have never had in my life, and I am worried and feel overwhelmed and cannot take proper care of my baby. I am always checking myself and shaking my head. I am worried that they might have missed a tumor with the MRI because it did not have contrast.

For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations. If the size and number of cysts are more, then I suggest consulting a gynecologist as you may require surgery.

She had taken my blood sample and it was negative. But, still I have not gotten my periods and it has been a week ahead. What could be the reason for my late periods?","Doctor":"Hello. As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses.

I dont know his he needed to treat or just talk to the other patient. He came back in my room and put new gloves on but didnt wash his hands and continued. He off couse may have washed his hands in the other room.  I have anxiety about my health and worry about contracting something like HIV or Hepatitis.

Am i right thinking that it would be unlikely that he could have infected me with something like HIV/Hepatits this way?","Doctor":"Hey, That is great that you are cautious about hygiene. But its perfectly fine. Your doctor would have definitely washed hands before wearing gloves. Secondly, HIV/Hep C viruses don't act at other person in seconds. It takes months or years to become active and then start with some symptoms after years . This won't be the case you are healthy mA.  Bleeding during scaling is very common when tartar is removed at boundaries of gums. It promotes a healthier gums production later. For being having no doubts about any viruses you can get your relevant blood tests done. Like CBC, Hiv tests done 6 monthly that will definitely rule out this thing in your mind.

Is this a case of high-risk pregnancy? Does it show any abnormality? Please let me know.","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Let me put forth few facts. Your age is in normal limits and not in high-risk for anomalies or genetic problem. Only after 37 to 40 years it is high-risk. You do not seem to have any medical complications. You have one 5 year old child, so the chance of next healthy pregnancy is very high, both of you have proved your capability to have children. I know you had two bad incidents, but accidents do occur. Let me explain about NT (nuchal translucency), it shows the thickness behind the neck of the baby, which indirectly increases when baby has a genetic problem, we use it to screen for Down's syndrome, also called Mongolism or Trisomy 21. It can also diagnose problems like cardiac problems, musculoskeletal and lymphatic abnormalities in the baby. Since the baby's growth is matching with gestational age, only Down's syndrome has to be thought.

How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method.

Because, it is a volatile compound and causes vapors entering the lungs through the airways. 3. As it was only two drops, I do not think it may cause much trouble. If he feels short of breath contact me back, otherwise fine. 1. He should avoid re-exposure. 2. Rule out if there is some sort of suicidal ideation due to depression or anxiety and take him to a psychiatrist for physical evaluation.

I used it for 30 days continuously, but no use. How many days should I take that powder and how to overcome this problem?","Doctor":"Hello. For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations. If the size and number of cysts are more, then I suggest consulting a gynecologist as you may require surgery.

She had taken my blood sample and it was negative. But, still I have not gotten my periods and it has been a week ahead. What could be the reason for my late periods?","Doctor":"Hello. As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses.

How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

If there is no burning, itching or foul -melling of discharge than no need to worry. Vaginal infection can happen routinely if you do not follow some precautions. If the discharge is increasing or have urinary burning than have to do some investigation and antibiotics accordingly. Do drink more water so that urine should be clear. Keep the vaginal area as dry as possible. Change pads more frequently during menstruation. Eat healthy and less oily and less spicy food. Do urinate and clean the vaginal area immediately after having intercourse. Do follow these precautions and discharge should go down. Normal white discharge can be due to stress also. In the photo the discharge looks like normal (attachment removed to protect patient identity). But if foul smelling then tell. If you have more doubt and thinking of bacterial vaginosis then you can take Metronidazole 400 mg tablet twice daily for seven days. But I think if no other symptoms then it is not required.

Yes, your hemoglobin value is high and needs to be investigated. Let me know if your hematocrit values were checked. If it is high as well, the condition is polycythemia. The cause for polycythemia may be secondary to chronic hypoxia due to a chronic heart failure or chronic lung disease. If no secondary cause is present, then primary polycythemia can be evaluated through molecular testing for JAK2 mutation. For polycythemia, phlebotomy and hydroxyurea therapy are the treatments of choice. Get your blood pressure checked.

I used to eat cereal with milk often. But, suddenly milk came right back up. I could not hold it down for more than half an hour. At the same time solid foods, in general, became very irritating to my stomach. This has left me mostly surviving on almond milk and cocoa. Unfortunately, the liquid diet has its own issue.

How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

For more information consult a neuro surgeon online -->"},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am sorry as this will be a bit long. I will try to explain concisely. I am a 40 year old male, and I weigh 100 kg and 1.85 m tall. I have toxoplasmosis. Last year, I had a weird throat ache, like a persistent itch on the upper side of my left palatine tonsil. It is hard to describe, but it felt like having a stray bit of food stuck there. Over the course of a few weeks, it grew more and more painful, with pain radiating into the left ear and swollen lymph nodes on left side of my neck. So, I went to my doctor. He noticed an irritation there, and said it could be gastric reflux, and prescribed Esomeprazole, which had no effect. We tried some antibiotics, again without result. Other symptoms were mild fever and fatigue. So, after a month, I went to see an ENT specialist. This is when the fun starts. He examined my throat with an endoscope, saw nothing, and said it was gastric reflux. I told him I was a smoker, and he replied that for my peace of mind, we could take some time to figure it out and scheduled an endoscopic lung examination. A procedure which requires general anesthesia, to probe a bit that does not hurt and without doing any kind of non-invasive exam like an x-ray first. I did not do it. However, I did the other exams he wanted like radiography of left sinus and echography of sub-mandibulary gland, both the tests found nothing. The symptoms receded without treatment in the same way they had come, and by two months, everything was gone. And by the end of last year, that itch in my throat came back just like before, and then it became very painful again, with the same scenario. The symptoms were swollen lymph nodes on left side of the neck, mild fever (38°C), and fatigue. I also got muscle aches in various places, mostly left arm and left side of the chest muscles. So during the start of this year, I went back to see that specialist. He looked at my throat again, and he found nothing. So, he told me maybe it is psychosomatic, but I should still do an MRI just in case. I went back to my doctor and started from scratch. We did a throat swab, which was normal. The blood test showed toxoplasmosis IgG 2.8 IU/mL and toxoplasmosis IgM 3.25 IU/mL. Everything else was normal, and I do not have HIV, Lyme, hepatitis A, B, or C, and thyroid hormones are normal. So, I have toxoplasmosis, which according to my doctor, explains all the symptoms except the throat ache, which is very worrying. He says I should still do the MRI. I went to see another ENT who said toxoplasmosis also explains the throat ache, and I should not worry. He told me not to do the MRI. He also told me I had reflux, so I stopped worrying. Does toxoplasmosis and acid reflux explain all the symptoms? Should I do that MRI? Or perhaps do other tests? I smoked from age 25 until last year. I quit for six months, then smoked again for six months, and now just quit again, hopefully for good. Also, I used to drink alcohol in unreasonable quantities at night with friends, but I stopped that too. Since then, I have learned that cigarette and alcohol are a risk of amygdala cancer, but I probably have not got that. Still, it is a good reason to get rid of unhealthy habits. I gained 20 pounds last year after quitting smoking. And lost them with a bit of cycling and a little diet. Right now, I am in a general good shape except a bit of a stomach. When I used to cycle a lot, my rest heart rate was 55 bpm. I had too much work recently to exercise properly, so I am around 70 to 75 bpm right now, and my blood pressure is normal. Thank you for your time.","Doctor":"Hi. Thanks and regards.

Our family friend suggested me to consume Kalarchikai medicine, powdered mixed with pepper and honey to have it for one mandalam (48 days). I have completed nearly 44 days by consuming one small ball of the mixture every morning and before two weeks I got my periods. Then I had checked whether the cysts were dissolved by having an abdomen scan. But still, small multiple follicules have been seen in it with both ovaries enlarged. Kindly suggest me what I can do further. I got married before one and a half years and I am much worried about my pregnancy. I have gallstones as well.","Doctor":"Hello. I just read your query. See Kalarachi Kai choornam is helpful in amenorrhea. As far as small cysts are concerned they are unmatured eggs which failed to induce menstrual cycle previously, as a result, they got collected in the ovary and they will remain in the ovary. Now, you have got your periods you can start trying for conception. But I advise you to do it under the supervision of a nearby gynecologist because egg size is important while conception and that you can know by ovulation study. Ovulation study is performed under the supervision of a gynecologist. For gall stones, surgical intervention is required generally. Medicine is not of much help."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, My daughter is one and a half months old. One of her eyeballs appears to be more inside than the other. What should we do?

How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

I feel sad, irritated and angry most of the times. It has been going on and off this way for the past five years. There are certain eating issues too. I do not feel like eating. I do not get hungry. I just eat one meal a day. And sometimes when I do feel like eating, I do not because I get scared I will put on weight. All this started five years back. I was in class nine when my section got changed. So, my grades started dropping, and my relationships with friends, teachers, and my parents became worse. It was like everybody hated me. My mom thought I was a burden. I got very very jittery at that time. Once, I was at my table studying, when my dad came from behind and suddenly pulled me out of the chair and slapped me. I got so scared I wet my pants. After that, sometimes I became very jumpy. I would freak out even when I heard the sound of a door opening. Although I am not so scared now, I still feel low.

From what you have told me, you seem to have had features of PTSD (post-traumatic stress disorder) and could be having symptoms of depression and eating disorder. My advice to you would be to personally visit a psychiatrist for a holistic treatment as it is also affecting your eating and could have other health issues related. You need a thorough assessment and many sessions because you seem to have a lot of stressors. You may require medicines and also need supportive psychotherapy with cognitive behavior therapy to help you deal with your issues. Also, maintain a journal and pen down your thoughts and fears. Writing will help you feel little better. Do deep breathing exercise like pranayama. It would also help your mood. Also, since you are not eating well, you may need nutritional supplements like vitamin B complex. Keep yourself busy with studies or hobbies. Kindly visit a psychiatrist. Hope this helps.

I have gone through your query, attached pictures, and your previous prescription. (attachment removed to protect patient identity).  These cold sores are of viral origin and it is called herpetic stomatitis. This has a high recurrence rate meaning as long as the immune system is little underperforming, it can come again and again. Also, taking antiviral drugs could put your immune system down. You should compensate by eating healthy foods and drinking adequate water. There are certain instructions you can follow to reduce its recurrence: 1. Taking antiviral medicines on time without skipping or forgetting the dose. (The antiviral drug which your previous doctor had prescribed will suffice). Please take the same set of medicines for another course. This time without skipping doses and take them at the correct time. 2. Avoid hot, spicy, salty foods, citrus fruits and its juices, carbonated drinks, etc. 3. Drink lots of water. These treatments can make your body dehydrated. 4. Eat healthily. Take a balanced and nutritious diet. Increase fruits and vegetable intake. 5. You can place ice cubes intermittently over those sores for faster relief. 6. Maintain good oral hygiene. Rinse your mouth after every meal. Brush twice daily. This will prevent any bacterial or other infections over those sores and promotes faster healing. It is highly contagious and hence limit personal contact with others and children.

The first time I experienced depression four years ago was when I traveled and had a really amazing time and cried a lot when it was time to go back home. I really cried like never before for two days before our traveling time and I slept and woke up with depression. I do not know why I was so terrified of going back home, I really do not. All I knew is that I wanted this amazing feeling to last. It was a religious place where I experienced peace. Now, I am out of town for the fifth time after that trip but, this one is different. I had this feeling again. I started crying really bad and want these moments to last and not go back home. How do I deal with it this time? I want my trip to give me energy for what is coming.

How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

I have thoroughly gone through your case and can well understand your genuine health concerns. 1. No, there is not much problem right now as he vomited and also had a lot of water. It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases.

For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations. If the size and number of cysts are more, then I suggest consulting a gynecologist as you may require surgery.

As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses.

During this, my chest also feels quite tight and uncomfortable. At the University recently, I had a physical examination, and the nurse noted that my pulse was a bit irregular. No one in my family has any heart problems. I do have anxiety, and I am taking anti-depressants.","Doctor":"Hello. Palpitations are very common and usually, they are not serious until there are accompanying symptoms like lightheadedness, dizziness, fainting or drop attacks, etc. One of the most common causes of palpitations is anxiety, but it can also be due to heart rhythm problems. So, these must be excluded first. I advise you to get an electrocardiogram (ECG) done at the time of palpitations. If that is not possible, then get a baseline ECG at any time of day or night, and another test called 24 to 48 hours ambulatory ECG. It will record your ECG continuously for 24 to 48 hours, and any palpitation episodes will be recorded. No need to worry, palpitations are not life threatening. I suggest the following: Follow-up is advised within seven days with these reports. Regards.

He was previously on 60 mg Paxil and had very hard withdrawal symptoms. Why is he still put on 20 mg?","Doctor":"Hello. Seroquel (Quetiapine) and Oxcarbazine (Oxcarbazepine) are indicated in bipolar disorder as both have mood stabilizing properties. Paxil (Paroxetine) and Gabapentine (Gabapentin) are used in anxiety or depression. As you mentioned that Paxil was used in the highest dose earlier with a difficult withdrawal, now your doctor may be using it for acute bipolar depression and wants to taper him off it as soon as the depressive symptoms clear. He will not have much of withdrawal symptoms as the dose is on the lower side. It is not uncommon to use two or more mood-stabilizing drugs in bipolar disorder when the person is not responding adequately to one drug. Also, in acute bipolar depression, antidepressants are used in combination with others drugs to treat it.

Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

I have thoroughly gone through your case and can well understand your genuine health concerns. 1. No, there is not much problem right now as he vomited and also had a lot of water. It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases. Because, it is a volatile compound and causes vapors entering the lungs through the airways. 3. As it was only two drops, I do not think it may cause much trouble. If he feels short of breath contact me back, otherwise fine. 1. He should avoid re-exposure. 2.

For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations. If the size and number of cysts are more, then I suggest consulting a gynecologist as you may require surgery.

As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses.

From your report, it looks like your teenaged brother is struggling to regulate his behavior, blames others and is not able to take responsibility for his actions. As you may know already, there is no quick fix solution. Try to be supportive and available whenever your brother needs you. He is lucky to have an understanding sister like you. He needs to gently changed when he says no one cares about him. Why does he think so? Is he misinterpreting things? You said he gets on well with one of his brothers. Use it positively and involve this brother in getting help for your troubled sibling. Encourage him to enroll in some course, apprenticeship which will give some positive experience for him. Encourage him to join some sports clubs. Discuss with your parents about adopting a supportive, firm, boundaried relationship with your brother and avoid criticism and confrontational interactions. It may help to have a mentor to talk to him regularly and guide him to make the right choices. It can be any responsible adult whom your brother trusts and will talk to.

I think they have caused me jaw issues (chronic facial tension radiating to all areas in my face and associated with droopy eyelids and jaw clicking and aberrant jaw positions, etc., and I can move this tension around with purposeful movements of facial muscles and pressure sensitivity on the face-tension is trapped, worsened, altered by glasses, pressure, and prescription and eye movements). I believe this began when I stopped wearing them 24/7 and particularly when I switched to wearing them every other night. I have noticed that my jaw is asymmetrical and perhaps small particularly on the RHS (may be a link to why I was initially getting tension symptoms on the RHS) so maybe Invisalign causes issues, stretches, small and asymmetric jaws excessively, or I have some random unexplained predisposition to my jaw getting confused by regularly changing bites or something (still think the latter may have something to do with the former). I just wanted to inform you of this as I have been told these symptoms are unique, functional and although Invisalign is known to sometimes cause TMJ problems it is not heard of causing issues like this. I am open to suggestions. Thanks.","Doctor":"Hello. The symptoms described by you are rarely caused by Invisalign, it may cause TMJ (temporomandibular joint) problems in some people but for a shorter duration as it is not permanent. Actually allergy means that you have redness in the area and if you wear for some time it cause some reactions in the local area and may also in the body. Do you have something like that? The symptoms are mostly related to TMJ, the reason may be that you can not bite on your teeth and you are now biting on Invisalign, and this can increase your bite where it normally was. The best in my opinion will be to consult your orthodontist if you can pause your treatment. Stop wearing Invisalign, rest your jaw for as long as you can like do not eat hard or crunchy or sticky food. Soft diet, no prolong talking, do not open wide too much especially yawning. Also, use over the counter pain killer for relief. I hope this helps."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, My son is 5 years old. Since yesterday, he has a cough and running nose.

Although your ejection fraction is now 50%, your BNP (brain natriuretic peptide) value is high which is the reason you are experiencing edema and dyspnea. Increased BNP causes a fluid and pressure increase in your heart, which in turn manifests as edema and dyspnea. It simply means you are still having a heart failure. It is very good that your pacemaker was switched to a biventricular one.

It is fine because it was only two drops. 2. We usually do not go for emesis (vomiting) for phenol poisoning cases.

For PCOD (polycystic ovarian disease), powder Kalachikai has a good effect, but the duration of treatment is long (more than three months). For proper evaluation of disease, please go for USG whole abdomen and other investigations. If the size and number of cysts are more, then I suggest consulting a gynecologist as you may require surgery. If the number and size of cysts are less, you may continue treatment along with syrup Evecare 10 ml BD and Kanchnar Guggulu two BD.

She had taken my blood sample and it was negative. But, still I have not gotten my periods and it has been a week ahead. What could be the reason for my late periods?","Doctor":"Hello. As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves. The menses can get delayed even up to two weeks, so just wait for another week and they should arrive. If not, then you can safely opt for a progesterone withdrawal to resume menses.

My weight increased almost double within this time and I am not taking any medication. Please prescribe.","Doctor":"Hi. Periods can be irregular due to PCOS (polycystic ovary syndrome). But it is your hormonal cycle which is disturbed and periods are irregular due to it. You can take Ovral-L like hormonal medicines for 21 days and then seven days gap and repeat for 21 days for three cycles. Period should come in the 7-day pills free period. Do thyroid profile test. Try to reduce weight. Because hormonal imbalance is very difficult to treat. And the same you can achieve by just losing weight. Because your body requirement decrease and your body produces same amount of hormones. Periods can regularize on its own. Do drink more water. You may need to do other hormonal tests if it does not regularize after all these. But with delayed period and PCOS there is no much to worry. Problem can be delayed menses and difficulty in conceiving. With delay in menses, your blood levels become good. Yes, if you are trying for pregnancy then you may require treatment. Otherwise no need to take much tension about periods. I hope this helps."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor,I am a 73 year old male. I have recently become progressively deaf in one ear.

Recently, she was ill for around three months with a bacterial infection in her legs.

Take these tablets only if you are not allergic to them. Do not take them if you are a known case of bronchial asthma. Follow up immediately in case of any untoward reactions. Advice: 1. Activities that cause pain should be avoided temporarily. 2. If the knee is swollen or sore, squatting, kneeling, twisting and pivoting, jogging, aerobics, dancing, and playing sport should be avoided until knee pain and swelling resolve. 3. You should wear a knee cap for support to the knee joint. Wear it all day and you can remove it at night. 4. Apply ice packs twice daily for 15 minutes each. 5. You need to get your x-ray of both knee joints AP (standing) and lateral views. Do the x-rays and upload them for accurate advice.

How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

Today he was a bit fine but, not actually enjoying. Will it affect my child's health? Will it create any psychological problem in him? I have heard that the cortisol hormone levels will be changed. Is that true? My in-laws are not staying with us. So, I have to either send him to the day care or I will have to send him to my in-laws'. Which is the best option?","Doctor":"Hello. I have gone through your query and understood your concern. Yes, it is true that the child may suffer from some psychological problems when not staying with the parents or the regular care giver as it occurs in some foster homes. But, as you mentioned that it is only for a few hours every day, it does not affect significantly. Make sure you are available to the child after your office hours and then take proper care of him physically and emotionally. Since in a daycare system, there will be other children with him, he will have company. So, it is not a problem. After a few days in the daycare, if you observe some changes in the baby, you may assume that the baby is not comfortable there. But, in the initial days, it is normal for him to behave like this as the baby has anxiety from the unknown surroundings and people. Leaving the baby at your in laws' place is a good option, provided they are able to take care of him. You can wait for a few days or weeks to see if the baby is comfortable in that place and then decide. Regards.

As the serum beta hCG levels are less than 3 mIU/mL, the pregnancy is definitely ruled out. The delay in the menses is mostly due to sex induced stress after the first time when reproductive hormones readjust themselves.

I was put on Zoloft. After about five years, I was moved to Lexapro as Zoloft was not working. After being on Lexapro for five years, I was moved to Pristiq. After 5 years on Pristiq, I finally had enough. With each of these medications, I had a very similar side effect. I became emotionally numb. Before going through this, I was a very active, outgoing individual. While on these medications, I became removed, uninterested, and experienced very little emotions. So, I decided to take an extensive test to identify if I had other mental health issues. The results came back that I do have general anxiety but, also ADHD. I was put on Adderall XR and I did not like it. It made me very irritable. I have stopped taking that. Now, my doctor has me on Wellbutrin while at the same time taking me off off Pristiq. I do feel a decent amount of the emotional numbness is gone since going to Wellbutrin. Here is my question: I feel like the Wellbutrin is helping the ADHD. I am not sure though if it is helping my anxiety and depression. What suggestion do you have regarding medication to tackle this? I am currently taking the Wellbutrin SR 100. Can you please help?","Doctor":"Hello, Welcome to iclinq.com. I have gone through your query and understand your concern. It is true that SSRIs (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor) make the person emotionally blunt when on a long term use. In your case, SSRI (Zoloft and Lexapro) and Pristiq (Desvenlafaxine) are ineffective and making you emotionally numb. You are diagnosed with ADHD (attention deficit and hyperactivity disorder) and anxiety, and Adderall ( a combination of Amphetamine and Dextroamphetamine) makes you irritable. So, that did not help you as well. Now, over to your question. Wellbutrin is the second drug of choice in ADHD after psychostimulants. So, it will definitely help you. This drug is also effective in depression and it reduces the emotional numbness caused by SSRI. The doses of Wellbutrin can be increased up to 300 mg per day in divided doses. But, Wellbutrin is not effective in anxiety. So, to control anxiety you can try a beta-blocker like Propranolol or Benzodiazepine for the short term. Try meditation or cognitive behavioral therapy to manage anxiety in the long term. Thanks and regards.

How long should my husband and I wait to safely continue to try to get pregnant? How long until it is out of our system? How long does cocaine stay in sperm? Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello, Wellcome to iclinq.com. There are few researches/studies on cocaine use by males and its effect on pregnancy. Few suggest that cocaine by itself has limited effects as most of the time it is taken along with other drugs or as a cocktail of alcohol and cigarette (tobacco). So, most of the people take not just cocaine but a combination of drugs. Cocaine narrows blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It can lead to erectile dysfunction. Few studies suggest that it has receptors on testicles and sperm. So, it can degenerate testicular tissues/or sperm quality, transfer from sperm to female egg and can lead to early miscarriage. Cocaine is a very fast acting drug which affects the nervous system and produces short-lived euphoric attitude for 15 minutes to an hour, but causes long-term damage to the body and brain like anxiety, depression, aggression, impairment of logic and critical thinking, heart problem, hypertension and decrease in bone density. Its half-life is an hour. So, it takes about an hour for half of the cocaine consumed to leave the body. But, with long-term use, the drug starts to accumulate in the blood and body tissues allowing certain tests to detect it in the system for an extended period of time. After a single use of cocaine, agents created by its metabolism can be detected in the urine for two to four days, and in chronic users, cocaine can be detected up to 12 days and highly concentrated cocaine can be detected in the urine up to three weeks. It can be detected in the saliva and blood for an average 12-48 hours. In hairs and sweat for an extended period of time, it can be detected. So, after all the above description, I do not know how your husband had cocaine, as a cocktail along with other drugs, or just cocaine? Secondly, how long he has been taking it? For you, have you been on alcohol, cocaine or smoking? If you had taken in the past, better to quit completely. My advice is, try to avoid drugs like cocaine, alcohol, ketamine, and MDMA completely for a couple of months before trying for pregnancy. Because, if the mother has an addiction, it has psychosocial effects on the fetus in addition to the drugs' side effects itself. Best of luck.

Just to be on the safer side, we wanted to use the emergency contraceptive pill. But due to some restriction in the country where we live, Plan B or emergency contraceptive pills are not available. I read that Yasmin, which is used as a regular contraceptive pill can be used as an emergency contraceptive pill at a higher dosage. Can Yasmin be used as an emergency contraceptive pill? And at what dosage?","Doctor":"Hi. How are you doing? Yes, as you have heard, Yasmin can be used as an emergency pill. Even if you have not ejaculated into her, she stands a chance of pregnancy if the pre-seminal fluid, the clear fluid that comes out before semen, which is rich in young healthy sperms, comes in contact with her genitals. As soon as possible, earlier the better, I suggest taking four tablets of Yasmin (combination of Ethinyl Estradiol and Drospirenone) at the time, repeat four more tablets after 12 hours. This being a high dose of hormones, it will suddenly increase the inner lining of the uterus. Then as it is a single dose, the inner lining will fall off. This makes it unfavorable for the possible embryo or baby to settle into the uterus. She will get her periods within 7 to 10 days of the last pill. But do not keep repeating this frequently, it can disturb the hormonal balance and can reduce the effectiveness of the pill. Consult your specialist doctor, discuss with him or her and start taking the medicines after their consent. This is an old method, but it is an effective emergency method. Just do not delay the pills. As time passes by, the effectiveness reduces. Hope I have clarified your query, do write back. All the best.

Please suggest some treatment that would help me last longer without ejaculating very soon during sex. Please help.","Doctor":"Hello. Premature ejaculation is not a disease, and it is seen in almost all men at some point in their lives. It occurs because of stress and anxiety about performing during sex or a previous bad sexual experience. Medicines can be taken initially to reduce your anxiety if you are married or have sex regularly. Practicing exercises to strengthen the muscles which help in ejaculation and retraining the penis to ejaculate late, would be a more permanent solution rather than taking medicines. There is no permanent cure by any system of medicine. You can read in detail about these exercises online:  All medicines are for temporary relief. The safest drug prescribed world over by qualified doctors is Duralast (Dapoxetine). A combination of the above-mentioned exercises and Duralast will be a permanent solution. After mastering these exercises, gradually you can stop Duralast. This tablet should not be taken every day, only during sex. Take the tablet one to two hours before intercourse.

Now, you have got your periods you can start trying for conception. But I advise you to do it under the supervision of a nearby gynecologist because egg size is important while conception and that you can know by ovulation study.

Medicine is not of much help."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, I am not sure if this is the right category to post my question in. My problem is with my mother-in-law. Or maybe the problem is with me, after all.My baby boy is now 8 months old. He is a handful most days. He is not the type that plays by himself and he gets bored really quickly. He is not crawling yet, but he is sort of mobile and very tiring to take care of. He needs constant attention all day long with no breaks except his two naps. Whenever I leave him in his crib to cook his meals or to go to the toilet, he screams horribly and continuously and will go on for at least half an hour, which is as much as I ever left him screaming. In the last two months, I have started feeling run down by all this crazy schedule. I used to be a relaxed, lazy individual and now I have something to do every minute. I cannot get a break and I cannot even think anymore. I started having migraines with aura, something I have never even heard of before, constant tension-type headaches and insomnia. And with these, also anger. A lot of anger. I never hurt the baby in any way, but I did scream at him a few times. I did cry in front of him. And I did have fights with my partner, also in front of the baby. In the last two weeks or so, the baby seems to not like me anymore. We used to have fun but now he is not responding to my jokes and my playfulness. Instead, he is becoming very attached to my mother-in-law. She comes twice a week to help and when he sees her, he squeals with delight and tries to jump out of my arms to be with her. He is obviously very happy to see her. When he sees me he could not care less, not even a smile. Once when he was on the couch and I extended my arms towards him and called him to come to me, he turned around and extended his arms towards his grandmother. Which I found humiliating and it filled me with rage. I could not sleep for days. I wake up at 3 to 4 AM and think about how he prefers his grandmother and how his grandmother is snooping into my life and at the same time, I need her since she offers me some time off. I feel stuck and have a lot, a lot of anger. I am ready to cut her visits off to once per week or less. I am furious at the thought that I gave up my life to stay here with this baby and care for him constantly and he prefers his cheery grandmother that comes in once in a while. I feel like I love my son less because of this. Generally, I loathe unrequited love and avoid it like the plague. I find it even more difficult to attend to his needs. I am ready to give up her help because the pleasure of the free time it gives me weighs less than the pain of seeing my baby reach out to her and ignoring me like that. I am so furious I am ready to part ways with my partner as well if he takes his mother's side. About my mother-in-law, she loves the baby but also intrudes upon my relationship with him. She always wants to hold him and pretty much tries to dictate how we raise him. But, this does not work, and I do things as I see fit. Overall, she has an influential position and I think the baby might respond to that also. I do not know. She is spoiling him and cuddling and cooing all the time she spends with him. And says stuff like 'come to granny. Granny loves you', 'you are so happy because granny is here, are not you?' etc. It makes me sick. Of course, she is very nice to me as much as she can. I am sure she is holding back a lot of privileges to be in my house with my baby. But, my baby becoming more attached to her and preferring her over me is something I cannot deal with. Do you think my baby stopped liking me because I raised my voice and was aggressive in his presence? Will it get better if I never do that again? I am really trying to, but it is hard for me. I have an explosive temper. What can I do? What should I do? I am at a loss. I am not good with managing my feelings and my relationship. I am super sensitive to rejection and tend to reject the people who reject me. But, this time it is my son and I feel like my love for him is fading away as the anger about the whole situation grows. My partner says I am being irrational and I reply that it is normal that problems stem from being irrational because that is what most people's problems are. Rational problems would probably involve calculus problems. So, why talk about that. Yes, I am irrational but that does not make this any less of a problem. He says I should see a psychiatrist, get some depression pills and then rethink this whole situation and decide if I really want to make his mother come less often. He seems involved in his work and inattentive to what is going on in the house. He says he will be more attentive to see if indeed the baby prefers his mother. All I know is, whatever his conclusion if I feel it is bothering me, then it does not matter what his so-called objective opinion is. I will want her out of my life, even if it means more work for me.","Doctor":"Hello. You can review with me for further follow-up.
