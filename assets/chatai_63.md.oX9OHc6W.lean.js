Well, now the pain you are facing from hip till the toes is nerve induces.What will be happening is due to the weakness in the core muscles, spinal muscles and hip muscles this sort of pain arises. It is not difficult to get rid of the pain. Infact it will be more easy and by doing certain exercises your hip will also become stronger to hold the THR implant.Try to meet up a physical therapist who can assess you once and then guide you exercises for core stability, spinal muscle strengthening and hip muscles.As when exercises are performed under supervision there is always a benefit for accuracy and no chance of having any other issue. You should work out on both sides rather one side. As body functions as a single joint unit.Unity is the biggest strength, so when all the muscles above and below the hip joint becomes stronger there will be no chance for the hip to dislocate again. Also, this will be a little slow process, but it will surely help you.I have seen many cases with THR and some really unimagined cases, but to be honest with the grace of god all went well with all of themWhat you need to keep is the patience and faith in your own self to strengthen the muscles, which will give you immense stability for you.If you have more question you can ask me directly,Thank you"},{"Patient":"I was in a motorcycle accident 4 weeks ago and got pretty beat up. 5 fractured Ribs and road rash. I hit the front of my right thigh hard. All the bruising went away but my right leg is still swollen. My thigh is numb and burns. It also feels kinda hard?","Doctor":"hi,Thank you providing the brief history of you.as you mentioned you met an accident and have injured 5 ribs and you have on bruising over your thigh and swelling of right leg.since you mentioned you have numbness and burning sensation over the right thigh it could be healing of the soft tissue of the skin.But to ask, have you taken any x-ray or MRI of the lumbar spine. As usually in RTA one shouldn't ignore spine. Any injury to spine is initially undetected and later gives symptoms. So I will recommend to take that.Also to advice you , is to perform regular breathing exercises. there are types of it and a physical therapist can teach you.- Deep breathing- Purselip breathing- Costal Breathing- Abdominal breathing.- Coughing and huffingNote - perform all exercises by placing the hand over the injured ribs. As it will restrict the mobility of the ribs and will not interfere in healing.Also this breathing exercises will help you gain strength in the muscles of respiration and also the abdominal muscles.Post this kindly do some simple upper limb and lower limb exercises to keep the joint mobility maintained and also the muscle property. Muscles should not go into wasting.also you need to keep the right leg over the pillow when you are lying down to remove the metabolic waste. Due to metabolic waste the healing can be delayed to its better to focus on each corners.Later on once Your ribs turns out to be good, slowly progress to core stability and spine strenthing so in future you will have a good and strong spine. As you must have noticed about the professional riders they all have a good abs , it is because to have a strong spine. Spine is the important segment of the human body which connects the upper and lower half of the body. later on you will be focussing on lower limb strengthening as a best so the weaker muscle becomes strong and you have a strong legain.Also, if possible kindly take an MRI just to have a doubt clear that the spine is safe. the symptoms of burning and numbrness can be because of it, so for ruling out this one doubt it's on a safer side to get it done.I hope to see you soon with your motorcycle again.with the grace of God I wish you a speedy recoveryregards"},{"Patient":"I have had terrible lower leg pain.

Now back again after 7 years the pain is same but the nature of pain is weakness, pain, tingling , numbing etc??if that is the case you need to get an MRI of the lumbar spine done to see a soft tissue Injury. As age progress the spine becomes weaker and this tends to apply pressure on the nerves, which will lead to all such symptoms.Also, you can use the hot water fermentation for relaxing the muscles.I suspect it that you had a mild nerve irritation in the past but it was never traced by diagnostics. You should have opted that time only spinal Strengthening exercises.well now it's 7 years so let's look ahead to solve this mysteries pain.Focus on doing some small lower limb strengthening exercises like static quadriceps and hamstring, ankle toe movements. Along with this kindly perform some deep breathing exercises as breathing exercises plays an important role while any activity.Also post this you can proceed onto the straight leg raise as within 2 weeks of Static quadriceps and hamstring the muscle will be strong enough to perfrom SLR.Post this again With a week or so you can start doing core stability and spine Strengthening exercises. and I am sure you won't find much pain.Sometimes the nerve is getting trapped but the scans turns normal. for this reason all diagnostic reports are mentioned - this is not an actual diagnosis and kindly correlate with clinical symptoms.Well by performing this exercises you will be fine in 6-12 weeks.

Fatigue is occurred by the reduced metabolism and in a lamen sentence as low endurance.To regain the active functional life you need to focus on performing static neck exercises , pushups and later on upper limb strengthening exercises. Also breathing exercises are a must to provide good oxygen to lungs and also to strenthen the accessory muscles of respiration which will inturn strengthen the muscles which supports the age.also when ageing of the spine starts small symptoms come and the muscle Strengthening plays a key role to put a hold onto the ageing.Also at a later stage you should strengthen the core and spinal muscles to keep the spine stronger.everyday exercise keeps the body to the optimum good health.I have seen many cases and at about few weeks of time the symptoms are totally eradicated and the body is strong enough again.with the grace of God I wish you a speedy recoveryregards"},{"Patient":"Hello, I am 33yrs old and I have stiffness in my right shoulder and neck.

You cannot expect the shoe to be the same after 2-3 years of constant use.As I said, degenerative change is a natural phenomena which cannot be revered and also there is no particular test we need to confirm the arthritis.Also, to help you better during arthritis there are medical treatment directed towards the symptoms and its relief. As medicine acts as a supportive system for the symptoms to lower, as this will allow the body to heal of its own. Also to mention that the body is the medicine of its own and this is also a normal physiological phenomena.Next coming to what helps in arthritis is - along with medicine there is need to strengthen the muscles around the joint involved so that the normal joint alignment can be achieved. Any changes in the normal anatomy of the joint occurs there is a pain.

Sometimes just uses one crutch I think she s seeking attention.","Doctor":"Hi,thank you for providing the brief history of the patient.As you mentioned the patient is on the crutch and is there any chance of having pain in the legs?Well that totally depends how she has learnt the Crutch Gait training. As there is always a specific way to use the crutch, frames, sticks, etc. If she learns properly she will not get any pain in the legs.Also, for performing crutch walking, One needs to have a stronger arms and a strong torso including the sound limb to be the best if there is injury on other side. If both legs are weak then until the upper limb and torso are strong it is tough to walk easily.Also, if the torso and upper limb are not stronger and still the patient is using the crutch then, what will happen is, the metabolism will be faster and the body will consume more energy which will lead her into pain and aches.She can opt for the physical therapist and strengthen the muscles required for the propulsion of the gait , even if it performed by using the crutches.

Also you need to understand that exercise is a slow process to give enough strength.Providing a good diet and moderate exercises will help alot.

Now as you are facing pain in the collar bone while breathing in and out right above the breast level. so understand this and make more precise the pain region is in between the collar bone and 4th intercostal space.On a safe note it is better to get the heart checked once by a cardiologist and also to take an x-ray of that area so the superior  lobe of the lung will be exposed and will be assessed further. This is just to rule out if you have any systemic pathology.Also coming to the pain, if it is muscular you can do some gradual massage in that area as the spasm of the respiratory muscles can be reduced by the same. Doing regular deep breathing exercises and costal breathing exercises will help improve the capacity of the lungs and also strengthen the muscles of the chest.You can slowly progress to the upper limb exercises which will help to add on some more strength of the pectoralis muscle.Perform some slow static neck exercises as it will also help strengthen the secondary muscles of respiration like the sternocleidomastoid and scalenous group.Since you had a pathology of squamous cell in the past the weakness of the accessory muscles of respiration is a chance. Doing breathing exercise will help improve the strength and reduce the pain.also to add on, that breathing exercises will even help the cellular physiological to the optimal as the cellular mechanism needs improvement too avoid any further occurance of the squamous cell.with the grace of God I wish you a good health.Regards.Jay Indravadan Patel"},{"Patient":"I am experiencing significant cracking in my back and neck.

Along with this the muscles of the neck region. The cause is the degenerative changes. It occurs due to wear and tear or it may be an ageing factor.With exercise 100% of my patients have recover and back to action.

It could be temporary impact of the ball on to the brains memory to grasp it as a protection and keep twitching.

At this point we havent done anything further and i am not sure what to do.","Doctor":"Hi, I had gone through your question and understand your concerns. In this condition i will suggest to go for contrast bath, you just need 2 buckets 1 with hot water and 1 with cold water. You can check temperature with your normal hand. Start with dipping the injured part into hot water for 3 minutes and than dip it in cold water for 1 minute, repeat it 3 times and stop the process with cold bucket. It will stimulates the nerve endings. This is a slow and natural process to stimulate the nerves. I hope you will do it with patience and hope, neural process takes time. Start on these and result will seen in 2 to 3 months. Wish you good health."},{"Patient":"I was in the er over a month ago due to what I was told were bruised muscles in my right upper rib cage they did x rays ... Said it wasn t pluresy...

Could it still be from supposed bruised muscles?","Doctor":"hi,thank you for providing the brief history of you.let's being with the pain you are having in your chest area. since you may had a direct impact on the rib bones, it will give pain for some more time . Healing will take it own time as the rib bone is thin chip of bone.also, as x-ray has confirmed no fracture or pleurisy you shouldn't worry much.you should try performing regular breathing exercises - Deep breathing, coastal breathing, diaphragmatic breathing.note - when you do breathing exercises you should place the hand over the area affected as it will give support to the area to avoid any pain.you can repeat the same for as many times you feel to do it in a day.with the grace of God I wish you a good health.regards.for any doubts you can contact me directly.Jay Indravadan Patel"},{"Patient":"Hello. I have pain on my right side. It began in 2013 and wrapped around my right side. It was undiagnosed or misdiagnosed for over a year. Finally, after me pushing for specific tests, GI doctors found out I had a GB working 20%, a hiatal hernia and I have diverticulosis. I am overweight, 5 8 and then weighed 210 at the point of surgery. I am back up to 250, female. The problem I am having is the right side pain has gone but the protrusion that was on my stomach (right side under ribcage about four inches from the sternum) is visibly more swollen than last year and the last few days is painful and I am concerned even though my lab work is always great. Any ideas what could be the protrusion? Sorry. I am unemployed or I could afford to go to a specialist. I do not qualify for Medicaid in GA and cannot afford Obamacare......","Doctor":"hi,thanks for providing the brief history of you.since you mentioned you are overweight and you has hiatal hernia, you also underwent surgery for it.your weight was 210 and now it is 250.I will initially recommend you to do one abdominal scan on a safer note. Meeting a specialist will not harm you. If you have to pay little you can get it done rather getting pay later with huge amount while admitting.also to mention, you need to do core strengthening exercises and overall body as well. your muscles should be tonned to avoid any protrusion or empty space in the abdomen.also your weight should come under control this will happen if you do regular exercises. if you start slowly and steadily it will help you. meet up a physical therapist and tell him the complain you have with protrusion and pain in abdominal region post and pre surgery.he will surely help you and teach some exercises which you can perform on your own later. doing the correct exercises will help you make core stronger and any thing after the abdominal surgery you needed to do exercises to tone the muscle.it starts with breathing exercises initially and later onto the progressive exercises.if you follow the routine exercise regimen you will get good tonned muscles and any injury coming will be avoid or subsided.With the grace of God I wish you a good health.you can contact me if you have any doubts to tone the muscle and the kind of exercises you need to performregardsJay Indravadan Patel"},{"Patient":"I am experiencing abdominal pain on my left side just barely above the waist line.

I had difficulty getting the Ministry to provide funding for the transportation, and if I had missed this appointment, Dr. Myden would have billed me 100 dollars for missing it, to have absolutely nothing done about my knee except to be told that I walk poorly because of pain, and that if I could afford it, he would recommend therapy for the muscle wasting in my knee, and to get another x-ray, as the previous one is two years old. Do we have a two tiered system where doctors can bill people for missing appointments due to weather and transportation costs, and to not try to seek alternative arrangements for care, of a person, regardless of income level, or even in spite of it here in BC that I know nothing about?","Doctor":"Hi,First of all thank you for providing the brief history of you. I am sorry to hear about all these trouble getting towards you.Let me focus on what i can guide you which can help you fight the trouble you are facing physically.You mentioned you have pain in the knee joint due to arthritis.Lets look into the deep of it. You had ACL and Hamstring issue. Now arthritis is a ageing process for which no one can reverse it except your own body. Human body is a self healer and what medicine can provide is to support the systems which can help it to heal and allow physical status of the body.Since you had ACL and hamstring repair, Your need to focus on One simple thing now, that is strengthening the body as a whole unit. For which you may need some proper guidance, assistance and support.You need to start slowly first doing the ankle toe movements, which will help to get the strength in the muscles of the leg and also the vascular system of the below knee will improve.Dont get bore here.. there is still more to focus here.Look for lying down on your back and do straight leg raise and hold for as long as you can as it will be isometrics and isometrics give abundant strength in the muscles.Next you need to do not only for the leg affected but also the leg which is not affected as well. Since body works as a unit and the unit has to be gathered with each way. same leg lifting you can do by lying down on your side and lift it up sideways which will strengthen the side of the thigh muscles.Then proceed onto strengthing the back of the thigh and the inner of the thigh. all the exercises you can either learn from a physical therapist of either you can learn from research articles available on google. as in the research articles they mention the complete detail of the same without anything missing.Strengthen your core muscles and also strengthen your spinal muscles as well.Do try to achieve plank exercises for 3 minutes for a minimum and go upto 10 minutes.Perform reverese walking and see to that you strength the last 1/3 of the the quadriceps muscle.Strengthening the lower body as a whole on both sides will help you alot by fighting the arthritis issue.Try to perfrom knee ROM exercises as it is a must to have a complete ROM in each joint.Do single leg standing and sitting up exercises which will give you immense strength as well..This is just the beginning.Once you master in this will teach next. I have seen many cases with OA knee and my all cases are above 60. All does well and do on a regular basis running without any pain and aches.With the grace of god i wish you a good healthIncase you need more information you can contact me.RegardsJay Indravadan Patel"},{"Patient":"I have always exercised a lot. But back in January I had a fall on some stairs where the heal of my shoe caught and I fell on both on to concrete. I knees we re very sore my foot the one that got caught . And the front of my shine . I walk a lot, feet get sore after and a burning in t h e knee..if I where shoes with a he as l it m a keys this worse","Doctor":"hi,thank you for providing the brief history of you.Since you mentioned you had a direct impact onto the knee and your shin and foot are sore, you need to first rule out if any old fracture is present or any bony malalignment.this can be ruled out by a CT/MRI/X-ray.you said you exercised alot, but what exercises you performed is important. You even had a fall on a concrete, So the impact will be big enough. As bone is a hard tissue and muscle is a soft tissue, the impact will be varied by landing on the muscle and different from landing on the bone.Once your X-ray/CT/MRI shows all fine you can look ahead to next step or else you need to strictly follow the ortho guidelines. For time being i can only say to do hot water fermentation until you visit the doctor.Self medication and self healing is not advisible as specialist can help better. There is nothing wrong taking their opinion.With the grace of god i wish you a great health.RegardsJay Indravadan Patel"},{"Patient":"I have a cut/crack where my 2nd to last toe bends.

Thanks for your help.","Doctor":"Hi,Thank you for providing the brief history of you.Since you mentioned you have a crack/CUT in the toes , for which you tried self medicating and not healing as well.You should better try a doctor though it is a small healing, Healing of wound is necessary as any infection might get catch hold of it and later on it will become difficult for the doctor to deal with.Also as you mentioned about CUT/Crack - i do not know how it got hurt, if it has happened to any metal cut then you should take a tetanus injection as well.Also, if your sugar levels are high then only the wound is not healing or may be some other scene which has to be examined.Doctor will surely help to get it heal faster, and even the depth of the injury is not known.Anyways, If you feel to visit the doctor you should go ahead, never ignore the smallest injury as it may become big as well.Kindly note, when the self medication is failing there is no point delaying to get the wound examined.Still, i can say, you can keep the wound clean and continue the cream you applied. Clean the wound with spirit and keep it open to get heal.With the grace of god i wish you a speedy recoveryRegardsJay Indravadan Patel"},{"Patient":"for several months now, I have been having pain in my arm whenever I reach for something, it feels like a tearing muscle. just recently when I was tested for PAD, they found that the pressure in my right arm, was only 76 as compared to 107 in my left, could the two be related. everyday things, such as tucking in a shirt in the back, or trying to brush my hair in the back cause severe pain","Doctor":"hi,Thanks for providing the brief history of yousince you mentioned you already tested for PAD and the pressure was varying from arm to arm. I do not think this should be the case.May be you have tightness of the muscles which is not allowing it to happen.Try doing some stretches for upper limb and do some hot water fermentation. If its just a tightness it will surely come down.Suppose in case if it is not coming down then you should try meeting an ortho and get self assessed once atleast. May be certain times, due to the tightness of the muscles, there might be some nerve entrapement and also most of the people have trapezitis too. You can get treated for that as well and the pain can be taken down.You can even visit a physical therapist who might help you with the case of you after doing a thorough assessment.RegardsJay Indravadan Patel"},{"Patient":"Hi,I have noticed on the back of my right thigh that my veins have become gathered and raised,also have freckle like brown spots all over my ankles and raising to my lower calf.are the two related in anyway?spots are on both ankles etc but veins are only on one leg.thanks in advance.","Doctor":"hi,Thanks for providing the brief history of youAs you mentioned about the signs, i want to know if you had any particular injury or hurt yourself.Since you mentioned about the signs behind the thigh upto the ankles, it may be some disruption in the venous return, for which i will advice you to get once checked by the vascular specialist, also you may need to under go the doppler scan which can reveal if any blood clots are there.Usually, for active people though there are clots there might be no signs of pain, swelling, heaviness etc. as the muscles are in constant state of action.So i will recommend to get that check once. Post that, you can visit a physical therapist who can teach you exercises to help improve your signs. As exercise can help to gain much more benefits. Surgery is of choice if there is massive obstruction or there is too much swelling with constant pain, but if no massive obstruction or swelling then the surgery is not of the choice.

I pray you will be able to enlighten me relevant to the causating factors involved?","Doctor":"hi,Thanks for providing the brief history of youSince you mentioned that the pain is constant and it is making it difficult to stand, sit, turn etc you need to first lye down on your stomach and keep a hot water bag wrapped up in a towel to provide deep heating, by which muscle spasm comes down.If you do not have any pain in the hip, thigh, calf or feet than you should not worry much. This kind of pain occurs due to either muscle spasm in the lower back or sacro-iliac-joint dysfuntion. Usually it take 5-7 days for inflammation to come down if proper rest is taken. In case if the symptoms dont come down for a safer side you can take an X-ray or an MRI for finding any soft tissue injuries.If the pain is slowing down then you can proceed to meet a physical therapist who can teach you some core strengthening and spine strengthening exercises which will help you more.Never ignore a simple back pain also, as we never know how big it can be or may become. Some times due to ignorance the soft tissue injury becomes big and pain level raises.Also the core muscles and spine muscles are in constant use all the time and their strength is more important for future to avoid any major injuries.I hope i have answered your query.feel free for any more queriesRegardsJay Indravadan Patel"},{"Patient":"last 2 weeks I have mild (tolerable) pin pricking pain below my toe ( not the heel part) on both my feet.

Also you can take one chest x-ray if any accumulation of fluid is there since you mentioned the posterior aspect of the lungs.Also in the mean time you can start doing breathing exercises and steam inhalation.

Its never bad to take an experts advice.Also, in the mean time you can start some exercises which will help you to a certain level of your pain.Start with simple breathing exercises and steam inhalation.

The numbness and pain comes and goes and walking or standing for long periods increases the pain. I have an MRI that shows that I have a couple of herniated disks in my lower back and one in my neck. I also had a nerve test that showed that on of my disks is compressing a nerve. I assume that this is what is causing the symptoms in my leg. I have seen a neurologist and neurosurgeon. They neurosurgeon said that I did not need surgery and sent me to pain management. He told me that it was a muscular issue and that I should work on my core to strengthen my back. I have been to physical therapy twice, I received several injections, and I have been to two different chiropractors. All with little to no relief. What should I do next?","Doctor":"hi,thanks for a brief history of you. it looks clearly that you have tried all things. ofcourse you are right. the pain and numbness you are getting is because of the disc touching the nerve. physical therapy should help you. but it depends how you undergo and how long you undergo. core strengthening exercises takes a little time for the individual to build up the core. Also to mention that you need to focus on your hip muscles to strengthen. Taking too many injections in spine is not good and even doing more of anything with consuming medicine is not advised. Trying a rigid focus on core strengthening, hip muscles strengthening, over all body conditioning is advised. I have seen many cases with same issue and bigger as well. the quality of improvemnt i have seen is outstanding. kindly stick to physical therapy and please undergo for long number of sessions. undergoing one or two sessions with physical therapy might not help at all.even the effect of the spinal injection has to be utilized and once it's injected the next part is the patients effort to get the strength. usually surgery is avoided in such cases.I wish you will follow the rigid physical therapy protocol.with the grace of God I wish you a speedy recovery."},{"Patient":"Hi I just started taking dicyclomine for severe stomach pain in my upper abdomen just below my rib cage.

My family dr has send me with specialist they ve concluded that I have fibromyalgia. My problem is I can t find a specialist that deals with fibromyalgia in the Fresno ca area.. I m currently take 60 mg cymbalta but I m having major side affect to it! I m currently working full time , I m a bus driver public transit so I have to be very careful what I take. Any recommendations ?","Doctor":"hi,thank you for brief history.since your physician has diagnosed you with fibromyalgia I think you should know a little deep about it. human skeletal muscle tissue is composed of muscle fibers. having inflammation in the fibers of muscles is called fibromyalgia. now since you are taking medication you need to look further by helping the muscle to become stronger and improve the metabolism of the muscle. you can meet up a physical therapist who might help by using TENS for your pain relief and therapeutic ultrasound therapy for reducing the inflammation of the muscle fibers. Later on you may be guided for some exercises which you can follow at home. Also try doing meditation, yoga, breathing exercises and body conditioning. As I have seen patients with fibromyalgia and they have been helped with this & all are much fine. Taking high dose of medicine will not be good for future so avoiding high dosage or too much medicine is of recommendation.I hope you will get helped by my answer.with the grace of God i wish you a speedy recovery"},{"Patient":"hi, i fractured the radial head on my right arm 4 days ago now. i have had a few issues with temp casts until i can get into the fracture clinic (not for another 10days). i am now out of a cast in a sling strapped to my body and have a sock type thing supporting my arm also. i am a little worried about this tingly numb feeling im getting in my arm but mostly my hand. my fingers and palm still feel numb and have noticed my thumb and index finger are going slightly yellow too. this is making me little anxious but have mentioned the numbness already and nothing was really said about it. i have been have anxiety attacks over the past 2 days which ive never had before but im finding it all a bit overwhelming :( i just want to know if its anything you advise i got back to the hospital for. i just have not experienced this before so dont know what to expect...thank you so much for your time - im grateful","Doctor":"hi,as you mentioned you have fractured your radial bone. and you are not into the cast as well. usually there will be a little of nerve irritation which is giving you a feeling of numbness, tingling, pain, etc symptoms. now depending on which side of the hand you are getting this sensation is important to note. You can go back to hospital and meet the physician and discuss about it. Usually if the nerve is irritated we need to actually wait for the nerve to respond. Now the type of fracture you haven't mention here. so if it's a compound fracture it might be something to look into for and if it's a simple fracture then need to take a CT or MRI scan to find out the extend of injury it has happened and if any nerve is irritated.I hope you will visit the physician and discuss about the same.with the grace of God i wish you a speedy recovery"},{"Patient":"Problems on holiday walking getting through airport and then sitting in aeroplane able to do stairs but problem with slopes.

Try doing some gluteus strengthening exercises as the hip joint needs to get stability. this you can perform by lying down on your back and lift the leg up. once you finish your travel kindly meet a orthopedic specialist. he might help you and even may ask for a fresh MRI of spine. having a close view of the spine is important to plan further treatment.with the grace of God I wish you a speedy recovery"},{"Patient":"my wife fall on ice and pain start two days after she fell,pain starts in right upper leg ,after that is increasing in pain and burning sensation,she had already steroides shots and some therapy ,also she had x rays and mri done ,what i can do to relief her burning and pain in her right knee? she is taken now norco and using some burning cream that happen in two weeks all","Doctor":"hi,thank you for providing the brief history of your wife.since you mentioned MRI  & XRAY are done you haven't mentioned which region and what was the conclusion given by the radiologist. you didn't mention either where the steroid was given. let's assume that your wife had injury in the knee and the treatment was directed towards the knee. so now as you say she is having burning sensation that may be due to the steroid dose which is at times common. the effect of burning sensation stays for 72 hours +/-. post that the burning sensation comes down and the pain is lowered. Since you are at home you can help her by giving icing around the knee joint and it will help her to an extent by desensitizing the skin texture.hope this helpswith the grace of God I wish your wife a speedy recovery"},{"Patient":"Hi 3 weeks ago I experienced a weird painful pain under my lower left rib which gradually spread across my abdominal area. The pain felt like the inside of my stomach was burning and not like a heart burn type a burn but the pain was intense. It then went down to my lower right side. It was at this point I was admitted to hospital on suspected appendix. After X-Rays, scans multiple bloods and stool taken everything came back clear. 3 weeks on and the pain is still constant and forces me to sleep it off. I am on medication but does not seem to be working. My bowel movements are totally different to what they use to be and have a fowl odour at times and also an acid odour. I have another stool sample to do in a weeks time as blood was in last stool sample. Any help would be greatly appreciated","Doctor":"hi,thanks for sharing a brief history. having pain in the left side upper abdomen can not be appendix for sure and suspecting it as appendix??  pain in the upper left abdomen can be a blunt abdominal injury or a spleen issue. well since you were on a medication the stool you are passing has such odour. I think that should be the case which made you feel the blood in the stool. gastritis is also one of the cause for the left upper chondrium pain. Now what I feel is you may have a catch of the muscle in the left upper hypochondrium. Since you have mentioned that the reports came out clear.screening with the diagnostic ultrasound may reveal any systemic issue if related to any organ can be identified. even if this turns normal than it will be a muscle catch. You can try doing some diaphragmatic breathing exercises and abdominal breathing exercises by placing the hand over the area to strengthen the muscle. Also you can do some straight leg raise by placing hand over the painful area. Also you need to stay in constant touch with you gastroenterologist as to figure out if something related to gastritis is there. because when all reports are normal than a sudden pain can not be possible of the systemic illness. it can be muscular as well. have a discussion with a gastroenterologist and I am sure a proper diagnosis can come closer with diagnostic ultrasound imaging technique.with the grace of God I wish you a speedy recovery."},{"Patient":"I ve had GBS since 2003 & still have severe lingering pain mostly in both of my legs. I do have a spinal implant to help with the pain but have it turned up as high as it can go so can t walk when I m using it. My question is why does my pain nurse keep lowering my prescriptions when the original ones were helping. One nurse recently was arrested for writing scripts so would that have something to do with it? I asked them but I didn t expect to get an answer. It took quite awhile before my diagnosis when I originally got sick. I was 1 hospital then went to Yale.","Doctor":"hi, thanks for a brief history of you. since you mentioned you had GBS and post that you started getting pain in the leg. Well, first we should know the physical status of your ability as what muscles are weak here and there. second, are you performing any exercises or not? Severe pain in legs can be assessed by the nature of the pain. it can be muscular or it may be neuropathic. for muscular pain use hot water fermentation and try strengthening the muscle groups of the lower limb. for neuropathic pain you have to figure out if there is any nerve compression due to muscle spasm in its course. Usually GBS patients take longer time to recover and the duration passed in the bed can make the muscles of the back and hip weak which leads to pain in legs. for which a physical therapist can be of help and you can get ease of the pain with TENS and therapeutic ultrasound therapy. Also exercises for the Strengthening the core has to be followed by. to make a note here that you have a spinal implant so assessing the implant by taking an x-ray will be of insight for further help. an ortho specialist will assist you for the same.with the grace of God I wish you a speedy recovery"},{"Patient":"I have been struggling from a back injury from work for over a year!

Should I go to the ER? Incidental note of Bilateral cysts at S1-S2/S2-S3... Not on Doctor at Kaiser would ever discuss the cysts nor show me my MRI onMonitor until my new Doctor and for second opinion. He is not in and I am scared? Why are doctors so uneducated about the truth and reality and that Tarlov s cysts are a RARE DISEASE?","Doctor":"hi,thanks for the brief history of you. if you have severe pain going to ER is always a good option. since you have taken an MRI, NCV and EMG one should be able to come to a conclusion close by if any nerve is getting trapped in the area. since you mentioned even you have bilateral cysts at Sq-S2 and S2-S3 levels it is hard to do instantly anything to get the pain lower. but you should try out a physical therapist where I am wondering why you have been not advised yet. since the pain is more along with tingling and numbness getting the help from a physical therapist should work for you. The therapist might use therapeutic ultrasound and TENS to help you get ease of pain. Since it's invasive and works on pain gate theory as well you should find some relief. I have seen a couple of case and advised the same, the pain level has instantly come to a point where the disbailty of the functional movement had come to abiltiy of functional movements.

There are umbilicall hernia, inguinal hernia, incisional hernia, diaphragmatic hernia. If you tell us what hernia it is we will be able to advice you appropriately. In general, if a hernia had been fixed using only your tissues, there is a good chance of it coming back because the very first reason why you have a hernia is because your tissues are weak and let your organs go out of their position, so repairing a hernia with only your own tissue will likely lead to a hernia coming back especially for inguinal and umbilical hernias. so surgeons will repair certain hernias by using artificial tissues called mesh to reinforce your tissues. I advice that you see a specialist general surgeon."},{"Patient":"Hi. I am suffering from a severe pain in the upper part of stomach, probably in the liver area.

The PA said the MD said they would have to operate to remove it. It is very painful","Doctor":"Hi thereI understand you have a post traumatic bursitis. over your knee.One thing you must avoid at all cost is introducing an infection into your knee joint which will infect your replacement prosthesis. An infected knee replacement is very difficult and costly to treat requiring many admissions to hospital. One thing that can cause such an infection is multiple aspirations of your bursitis. Please avoid this. If the pain is so bad that you can't wait for your Orthopeadic surgeon to come back then it is probably infected and I would then suggest that you see another orthopaedic surgeon as soon as possible. If you are coping on pain medications  and can wait for you surgeon that is also good."},{"Patient":"about a year ago I was walking in my knee just suddenly gave out on me I went to the ER couple hours later and they said it was spraying today will recently it s been hurting me really bad when I walk and it s the outside my left knee and there s a scene burning pain behind my knee when it when I walk in when I like sit down and don t move it and it gives out on me when I walk and it gets a numb tingly feeling after about 10 minutes of being on it.

Nevertheless you had a severe fracture of the tibial plateau. this involves the knee joint. Even when the Xr shows only damage to the tibial plateau often times the cartilage of the femoral condyle is also injured and this can be seen on MRI and can be called condylitis just to say that there is inflammation of the articular cartilage of the femur(the cushion lining the end of your femur at the knee joint). if it is still within 3 months of the injury, you should get back your movement in the knee, You haven't mentioned how you were treated but If you had surgery you just need to carry on with physiotherapy and your knee will get back straight again"},{"Patient":"My adult son caught his 3rd finger in a winch rope last Mon.

If a doctor is out of town he should make arrangement for a colleague to see his post operative patients should there be problems. I don't think it is proper procedure, I would advice your son to have his finger looked at even by an emergency physician just to make sure that the finger is still viable(alive) and not infected.

Very scary.","Doctor":"Hi..Welcome to HEALTHCARE MAGIC..I have gone through your query and can understand your concern.... As per your complain it seems that you had a dislodged condyle [the portion of the jaw that makes a joint with the underside of skull] due to excessive opening of the mouth along with jerky movements leading to dislocation of the jaw and as only one side of jaw must have dislodged so you had deviation of jaw, and many a times the dislocated jaw rebounds back to its anatomical position either itself or manually placed by a dentist..Clicking sound may however be due to some abnormality with the articular disk that is a soft cushion present between the two bony portions of the joint and it may have displaced from its place or may be ruptured leading to clicking..You should take care as in case if you open the mouth too wide again the jaw can displace again..I would suggest you to consult an ORAL PHYSICIAN and get evaluated and get an ORTHOPANTOMOGRAM [OPG] done to rule out the abnormality and get treated accordingly..You can do warm compresses over the joint..Take a combination of muscle relaxant like Chlorzoxasone and painkiller like Ibuprofen..Take soft diet and avoid opening mouth too wide..Hope this information helps..Thanks and regards..Dr.Honey Nandwani Arora.."},{"Patient":"my son 12 yrs old, skinny boy start to have pain in his right elbow.

Good evening. I am Dr Shareef answering your query.I am not aware of your location. In case you are from a region where tuberculosis is not infrequently seen, then tuberculosis would be the most suspected culprit and the treating doctor should consider investigations related to that, like an ultrasound abdomen (which possibly has been done) , a CECT of abdomen to see the condition of the intestines, etc, apart from some routine blood investigations. A cough of two months duration adds to the suspicion. In case it is diagnosed, the condition is easily treatable, and your kid would become ok, but the medicines prescribed should be taken regularly and sincerely till advised. An LFT would be an additional blood investigation which could relate the side effects of an anti tubercular drug, if any.I hope this information would help you in discussing with your family physician/treating doctor in further management of your problem.

I can t even exercise or do any vigorous activity for that matter without being highly irritated. Please help.","Doctor":"Hi,Thanks for providing little history. Well, ususally when tingling sensation starts it can be due to any nerve related issue. But it is never true it is that only. Second, depending upon your activity level and physical fitness level one can comment further.

Usually people tend to lose weight or put on weight based on their body composition and the physiology of the human body varies from one to the another. Muscle weakness, Joint pain and headaches are common in Fibromyalgia. Let me assist you first in brief about Fibromyalgia. It is a condition where the pain is in the fibers of the muscle, due to which muscle pain, weakness, tiredness, headache, etc troubles the patient. For dealing with fibromyalgia one need to first understand that the recovery is slow and steady in this condition. Strengthening the muscles by doing regular exercises, going for long walks for generating enough cardiorespiratory endurance, are utmost importance. Do regular Breathing exercises as the oxygen is the source of energy needed for any metabolic reaction in the human body at the cellular stage. Doing meditation will help control the mind and behavior as in fibromyalgia usually there will be a lot of irritation and frustation too, so meditation will also help.

I am Dr Shareef answering your query.From your history, it seems that you have got some kind of inflammation in your abdomen, possibly a peritonitis due to the involvement of any of the intra abdominal organs. I would advise you to visit your ER room at the earliest, and not to wait till the next day. Once peritonitis is excluded, then rest of the treatment could be managed electively.I hope this information would help you in discussing with your family physician/treating doctor in further management of your problem. Please do not hesitate to ask in case of any further doubts.Thanks for choosing health care magic to clear doubts on your health problems. Wishing you an early recovery.

Bilateral carpal tunnel syndrome is quite common and has its own predisposing factors. Carpal tunnel release surgery is advised when everything else has failed to relieve symptoms and it has a very good success rate.

Show the scan and take an advice on the do's and dont's. then may be a first line to follow after this is to take adequate rest. then may be you will be guided to a physical therapist. he might teach some small simple neck exercises and then may be some upper limb exercises. then may be if the ortho.specialist feels that it's advisable for you too continue a play of tennis you can go ahead but if he says no then kindly follow the advice. neck is a very important place and having a stenosis at that level is not good and it's risky alot. kindly take care and God bless you."},{"Patient":"Hi, I was out side for there and a half hours and fell asleep, it has been two days with no relief, I have tried everything I can think of and still no relief, I am miserable.

I ve been back at work for about 5 weeks now and although the pain from the fracture is completely gone I m still feeling some soreness and discomfort around the ligaments and muscles surrounding my ankle.

Thank you!","Doctor":"Hi, i have gone through your question and understanding your concern, it is common to have this kind of soreness and discomfort after stress fracture. If i were your therapist, i would recommended you exercise therapy along with some ligament strengthening exercises, because after fracture the exercises which we do they only strengthen the muscle not ligaments. Ligament only get strength with stabilizing exercises. I would recommend you to go for this therapy program which includes, hot fermentation for 10-15 minutes around the affected area, start with some stretching for ankle muscle (in all movements of ankle)per stretch hold for 7-10 minutes and repeat it 5 times per action, just stretch up to pain starts just stretch in limit.

Only 1 to 2 mm on the side should be excised but too much skin and fat was taken out. My first eyelid surgery was 2011 to remove the skin sagging blocking my peripheral vision but there was 1-2 mm skin left and for more than 2 years I have been putting makeup in my eyes to cover that 1 to 2 mm that was left and have just decided to have it corrected this January 2014 and didn t know it would cause me more problem now that it deformed my face. Instead of correcting, the doctor did another blepharoplasty again. It was overdone and very aggressive where I lost a lot of skin and fat in my eyes.The bones in the side of my eyes and cheek bone got too close which I can feel which resulted in pulling my eyes down and my cheekbone moved up, because it is pulling each other my nose stretch too and the side of my forehead pulled down too. I can feel my eyes compressed or shrunk. It is too unfortunate to say that it really deformed my face. The most worrying part is my cheekbone moved up and the bones in my brows protruded due to the fat that was taken out. This is my main concern that I want to address. What is the best approach to this problem? How can the cheekbone that moved up and eyes that got pulled down go back to its normal position?","Doctor":"the best approach to this complicated case is to visit a plastic and facial reconstruction surgeon who will examine you properly and suggest a couple of things. there is still hope of deformity correction. difficult to say what needs doing without actually seeing your face."},{"Patient":"Hi I have been having a bad aching pain during the night in bed as I have slept and my side hurts in the morning when I get up.

I treat with heat daily, and repeatedly with electrical heating pads (Walgreen s) to alleviate pain. I walk stairs up and down to the basement in order to improve circulation as well as stretching when the pain allows. I know I need to move and elevate, but moving can be difficult, especially in the mornings, for hours on end. I need pain relief and a long term solution.

This will reduce inflammation, and will help numb the pain. Additionally, topical anti-inflammatory creams, such as Aspercreme, will help with pain.

At that time my doctor told me that my neck was completely bent in the wrong direction (due to the accident), and that if he did surgery there was a 50/50 % chance that I would be paralyzed from the neck down. Obviously I chose to live with the pain and on/off numbness of arms/legs (as my husband and I had five children to raise). 22 years ago, I woke with neck spasms that occurred about every 3 minutes 24/7; the pain being so bad that it brought me to the ground (you could actually see the muscles in my back/neck moving). My hands were going numb, and it felt as if someone were ironing my left arm with a hot iron. (My doctor told me at that time that my entire spine was degenerating, due to the prior accident, and although I was still quite young, that I had the spine of a very, very old person. 3 weeks later, I was FINALLY referred to a neurosurgeon. He saw me at 3PM one afternoon, and immediately scheduled surgery for the next morning. He performed a nine-hour surgery, fusing sections C5/C6/C7 together with part of my hip (no titanium plates back then). Although I have not had the excruciating pain that I had before my neck fusion, I have continued to have back pain (neck, mid back, lower back - due to the degeneration of my spine). (I haven t been pain free for over 37 years.) Although MRIs clearly show narrowing, I ve been told it s not enough for surgery. In the past 10 years I have endured having electric needles stuck into several of my nerves (on two separate occasions), physical therapy, injections into my spine (injected from the base of my spine to my neck, where the injection was released), pain meds (which I refuse to take because they are addictive), and nothing is helping. Even the injections into my spine only give me a day of relief. FYI I cannot take ibuprofen (it ulcerates my stomach), or aspirin, which causes me to have hematomas. Now the fingers of my left hand are going numb, as is the inside of my left forearm. My neurosurgeon is now retired. Is it possible that the numbness is being caused by my neck (my understanding was that the nerves to my fingers were in C7). On top of that, if I bend over, sometimes I can t get straightened up right away, and then have really, really bad pain in my low back/hip area (sigh). I am a short, petite person (size 2/4), and have tried to keep myself physically fit; however, I cannot exercise without increasing the pain. Someone told me that Botox was being used to treat neck pain. Does it have lasting results? Please advise.","Doctor":"hi there, it seems you have provided a detailed history of illness which is fair enough to help you with some options. botox is not a permanent solution. as per my practice I will recommend you to try doing breathing exercises, little strengthening of ur neck muscles, trapezius, triceps and deltoid muscles. regarding your lower back and hip.. kindly strengthen the core muscles and gluteus muscles to have proper support. focus on taking advice with a physical therapist and then onto an orthopedic specialist what are the DOS and donts for your condition. you will surely be helped by the grace of God."},{"Patient":"I have been having some pain under my ribs left side, like an aching and burning in the back.

Tendon usually glides easily through the tissue that covers it (called a sheath) because of a lubricating membrane surrounding the joint called the synovium.

I am Dr Akshay from Fortis Hospital, New Delhi.Swelling in your ankles can actually be due to a lot of reasons and if there is no associated injury, then you will most likely require a detailed physician evaluation because there are numerous medical conditions which can cause swelling not only in your ankles but entire lower limbs.I actually do not think that it is probiotic which should be causing any symptoms in your case but :Evaluation of LFT, KFT, Thyroid disorders has to be done.Also swelling can be due to cardiac issue which needs to be evaluated, it can also just be postural in nature when elevation at night may cause decrease in swelling.So as you can see if swelling is occurring without any injury, then a detailed assessment by a general physician is required for further management.Do not hesitate to contact me if you need any further assistance.

I am Dr Akshay from Fortis Hospital, New Delhi.There are many causes of swelling in the legs. Most common reason is postural and many patients develop it when they stand for a long time, but as soon as they elevate their leg up , the swelling subsides.It can happen after any injury which is a priority to diagnose and treat accordingly. Also there could be infection or inflammation which can lead to swelling.

I am Dr Akshay from Fortis Hospital, New Delhi.I think you had a quadriceps strain initially which was managed conservatively. Initially there was a Haematoma due to which you saw change in colour of skin.I presume what you are palpating right now is a fibrous nodule which has formed as a result of fibrous healing. Also you have mentioned that it is painless.Actually if there are no symptoms, then nothing needs to be done for it but we will have to see that there should be no increase in size and no increase in symptoms, otherwise further work up and investigations like MRI etc may be needed.

In January I tossed a bag that was too heavy and heard a pop in my shoulder followed by sharp pain. Over the next couple of hours I lost 99% of all mobility of my right arm.

I had been working on stretches and had gained about 20% mobility back. He watched from his desk and scheduled me for acupuncture - of which I just started. The acupuncturist has stated that my records state that I have tendinitis in the back tendons of my shoulder. This is not where it hurts - by about four inches.

Did I re-Injured it or does it just take that long to heal","Doctor":"helloYou must consult an orthopedic doctor alongwith fresh x rays of knee and leg for evaluation.If bracing has not helped a review is required maybe percutaneouuuus fixingg of tibial plateau may be required if it has not displaced, or elsee, an open internal fixation after reduction.Swelling and pain indicate healing is incomplete amybe x ray doesnt show any displacement, but union may be delayed and incomplete. Internal fixation will prevent risks for displacement and relieve pain and swelling.For six weeks rest to leg is necessary. Some surgeons prefer to apply  plaster cast  casing for undisplaced fracture and you may be required to stay in bed for six weeksconsult for the optionsthanks"},{"Patient":"I, female 55yo, last 2 month have periodic swellings in my neck, under chin.

Although I am now 71 years old, this condition was not diagnosed in me until I was in my late 60s when I consulted my GP regarding my sudden inability to hold my head up because of neck muscle weakness. A muscle biopsy was performed in December 2013 resulting in the above diagnosis. I have been trying to locate a neck brace or collar which will allow me to hold my head up in a normal position, as at the present time I must either force my head up by forcing my chin up with my fist or the open palm of my hand. I have tried a Miami J collar which was promising but was damaged to the point of semi-uselessness by the weight of my head causing buckling of one of the side supports. I was given an Aspen collar by the orthotist to whom I was referred, but it is so uncomfortable that I cannot use it for more than half an hour at a time without unacceptable levels of pressure pain along the jaw line and breast bone. I live alone with my 89 year old husband for whom I must help perform many activities of daily living. Any advice regarding a different type of head and/or neck support would be greatly appreciated.

Xray shows it as denser area than surrounding or adjacent bone.Once the blood supply is impaired , complete necrosis follows in 6 months to 2 years.So salvage operations are done with prosthetic implants or weightshifting surgery.I hope your doctor has confirmed if it is indeed avascular necrosis.Arthritis is different, in hip, it doesnt lead to avascular necrosis but destruction of joint surfaces and deshaping of joint in later stages.We must be clear whether it is arthritis only or avascular necrosis as treatment varies.Its best to leave it to your orthopedic or hip surgeon to decide diagnosis and treatment.Yes, as you are advised physical therapy it maybe just arthritis, which is more readily manageble conservatively, unlike avasculr necrosis which requires surgery more frequentlybest wishes"},{"Patient":"I have been having left lower quadrant and left flank pain for 3 weeks.

All was well and I was pain free until I had knee realignment surgery. After the surgery I had a bad fall landing from the height of a chair directly onto the resurfaced hip. Since then I have had pain which is slowly getting worse. The hospital have x-rayed the joint and done an ultrasound and there is no fracture, no metal in the blood tests, no sign of inflammation / bursitis, no infection. I have had 6 months of strong painkillers and anti-inflammatory medication, 6 weeks of ultrasound therapy and physio and still it gets worse. I have pain when I try to lift my leg and if I lie flat in bed I have intense pain from the front of the hip radiating into the thigh. If I bend down and stand up there is a sensation of grinding which is very unpleasant and after walking a short distance I start to limp heavily and almost have to drag my leg. The pins placed in my knee are slightly visible and I have no sensation in the side of my lower leg, I asked if this could be the problem but have been told it s not an issue but I am hoping to get them removed soon just in case. The hip doctors seem to think it is just muscle ache from the realignment surgery and that it will just go so I feel that they are not taking my pain seriously, their only suggestion at the moment is taking stronger and stronger pain medications.","Doctor":"helloI have studied your case in detail.The xrays and tests are negative for fracture and no metal problem, means the pain may be muscular as your surgeon says.The operation may have been proper size of both femur head and socket implants since for 2 years you didnt get pain, there is no loosening or osteolysis as not visible in x ray.If you still have doubts, which is not wrong to have because of pain and restriction of movement which was not before, you may seek opinion at some other orthopedic centre or surgeon.If something is wrong with aliignment in knee implants, it is possible to have altered mechanics to account for discrepancy in wal but pain doesnt explain-so presuming it to be muscular, takemedicines as advised and visit for review to a new clinic of knee and hip surgeonsbest wishes"},{"Patient":"I have on and off again ankle and leg swelling after a cardiac cath-----this has been going on for 3 years now.

A brief history, I have fibromyalgia, migrains, & degenerative disk disease.i also have unexplainable vision loss. I have had many head and neck traumas starting at 19months, none in the past 2 or 3 years!! And MRIs and CT 2 years ago show some old injury to my occipital lobe and a couple other spots they weren t sure of but said weren t a concern. 3 weeks ago I was told by the ER I was experiencing vertigo but before when I had it (2other times, and over 10 years ago) I was unable to have any balance or walk. This time the symptoms were loss of memory for 3 days(or very foggy) lack of hand eye coordination, foot and eye coordination, dizziness, headache, blurry vision, ringing and nausea. Everything got better for about a week then I woke up one morning very confused, nothing really made sense, everything was very loud in a deeps bass like time, everything smelled like chemicals (the rain, snow, shampoo, water, perfume, food) All foods tasted rotten or like chemicals except candies or high sugary foods! I had a huge headache and blurry vision which has yet to go away completely. This induced some panic. I also have had an increased heart rate, almost painful and could not eat or sleep for about 4 days because of it all. Things are better now, smells and taste has returned but only like 90% and the vision issues comes and goes, no dizziness, and the headache has changed to a dull thick one.

That was on a Friday morning, and performed by a different assistant than the previous two, each given a week apart on previous Fridays. Each time injected believe same med / Euflexxa and same amount was used and not sure exactly where precise injection site was located, think a local anesthesia may or may not have been used--very little specific instruction went on. Regarding activity - told 24 hours reduced level, not the recommended 48 hours we have since learned by looking up the procedure online - by Saturday afternoon, expecting to resume a normal activity level, went on a short bike ride to a local store. On the way home, noted a little more stiffness in the joint, but no other obvious problems, just a little more sore than usual, turned in early Saturday night. Tried to have a normal Sunday, by Sunday evening, noted an increased tightness in joint and top lateral shin area - had wife look at and massage leg/knee - she noted a golf-ball size effusion formed behind knee and that the adjacent veins were distended - no swelling in ankles or feet. The next day, nothing had changed, we assumed the fluid accumulation in the knee to be normal reaction to the injections, but reading said allergic reactions can happen and blood clots without obvious symptoms became a concern over the next couple days. The swelling behind the knee disappeared, but a subq mass appeared on the upper lateral shin area whitish and fluidic, my wife questioned if it is an inflammatory response to the hyaloronic product injected? We saw my internist yesterday to rule out embolism with ultrasound/Doppler (report is negative for clot). Question: Can effusion displace the injected gel, can it migrate, what happens to it then? Does it pose a further danger systemically, problems locally? Does strenuous exercise factor in? How is it rid of by the body, metabolized? Exit the body?

Infact for sitting you should buy a ring pillow or doughnut cushion which     has a hole in between, so when you sit on it, your tailbone area keeps     hanging in the air.     you can also buy a coccyx cushion for this purpose.3. avoid sitting for a long time4. till you get hold of one such pillow you can manage by alternate sitting    on each side of your  buttocks5. do seitz bath- take warm water in a tub and dip your bottom in it. do it     3-4 times a day.5.take a mild antiinflammatory like ibuprofen or naproxen.6. avoid constipation- take high fibre diet. this will avoid strain on your tail    bone while passing stools .it should improve in 2-3 weeks hope i have answered your query .if satisfied, please rate my replythank you"},{"Patient":"My friend has severe hip pain.

Since you have gone through a spine surgery some time there can be nerve irritation during surgery or after surgery due to scarring.

Examination Findings: Plain x-rays and the MRI scan of the cervical spine show an large osteophytic disc prolapse at C3/4 causing cord compression & associated with signal change within the cord. There is reversal of lordosis at this level with some CSF present behind the cord. At C4/5 there is also an osteohytic disc prolapse causing canal stenosis and complete vaffacement bof the subarachnoid space but no compression as such. There are also degenerative changes at C5/6 but not at C6/7. In extension there are 2-3mm of retro-listhesis at C3/4 & C4/5 presumably due to ligamentous laxity associated with a mark loss of disc height at those two levels. I was advised to under go surgery to decompress the canal & remove the threat to my spinal cord. It was explained to me that the main aim of this procedure is to prevent further deficits & that improvement of the current deficits cannot be guaranteed. The operation was accomplished by an anterior approach, but the sergion did not think that i was a particularly good candidate for cervical disc replacement in view of the marked loss of disc height and mild instability in extension. I was given a C3/4 and C4/5 anterior cervical discectomy and fusion using iliac crest bone graft and an anterior cervical plate. I was told the risks of this procedure, including the small risk of injury to the spinal cord, & the risk of pseudarthrosis, infection, recurrent laryngeal nerve injury, carotid and oesophagus injury & cardio-pulmonary complications. It was discussed that there is a risk of developing further degenerative changes at C5/6 level. Cervical disc replacement could perhaps be considered at this level if surgery is required in the future. Prognosis: The aim of this procedure is to prevent the development of further neurological deficit. There maybe some improvement in my current symptoms is possible, but a complete recovery is very unlikely. I had the procedure done at the end of 2004.. Things haven t been too bad with continual pain relief, but have always have had continual server pins and needles in my hands legs & feet. With continual server neck pain & continual head pain. The pain I am now getting goes from my neck down to my lower back and with me 24/7.

I appreciate your trust in HCM and assure you are on best portal on the globe for expert online medical services.I have thoroughly reviewed health query you raised, and well realize all of those concerns. Being your physician, I will take care all of them today and will extend my expertise to solve the problems.Painful stiffness after knee replacement is frustrating not only for patients but for us too. It is noted to be most common local complication after surgery. Usually the knee should gain its function by the end of 4th week. Based on what you said, you will most likely require manipulation under anesthesia by orthopedic surgeon. A revision surgery may also be planned instead but MUA has found to be most effective within first three months.You may take tab. naproxen 20mg once a day for your pain. Physiotherapy should be continued as advised and it is also mandatory after MUA.Hope I addressed all the concerns you have. Let me know if you have further questions. I will be more than happy to clear any doubts.

I could not put weight on my foot or move it. It hurt on the inside, the outside, on my big toe, and my ankle area. I waited a day to see if it would feel better but it didnt so I went to the orthopedist. They sent me to X-rays and did a weight bearing view and a top view xray. The doctors did not see any obvious fractures but they did see a small crack in my 4th metetarsal. They said it was natural and if didn t have to do with the injury. They decided that I had deeply bruised my foot so they put me in a walking boot and crutches. After a few days on the crutches, I switched to the walking boot and no crutches. Now, 2 weeks later, my foot hurts worse and hasn t improved at all. It hurts with the walking boot and without. My mom refuses to take me back to the doctor but I am becoming worried that it is getting worse. I am icing, elevating, and resting my foot but nothing seems to help.

Over the years I have had lots of joint, tendon and ligament stresses and strains and muscle pain just from everyday things like holding and picking up my children when they were little. It appears that degenerative disc and joint problems run in my family. My mother has now had both hips and knees replaced and several other family members too. I have been told I need a knee replacement in one knee and will be having scope surgery on the other knee tomorrow to repair the meniscus and clear out whatever is floating around in there. What is bothering me the most right now though is I had cortisone injections this past year for tarsal tunnel and other nerve pain caused to the top of my foot from a foot insert that made my shoes too tight. The first injection was in August, and then a second one in November because it seemed they missed the spot on the top of the foot. After the August injection I didn t seem to notice any major side effect, but after the November injection I felt like a hit a wall and had no energy, my muscles felt exhausted and weak, I started having muscle cramps, especially in my calves in the night and pre-waking hours of the morning, for a couple weeks I felt shaky and light-headed, and I also started losing a lot of hair. My primary doctor told me it threw my blood sugars off (I don t have diabetes) and she did blood work and said everything else was fine other than low vitamin D levels. I was referred to an endocrinologist and told the same thing. I was told it would probably take 2-3 months for me to feel back to normal again. I ve been taking vitamin D supplements and a multivitamin with minerals consistently for 6 months now and I don t feel much better, the night time muscle cramping and hair loss has stopped, but I feel totally exhausted and my muscles feel weak and the leg muscles seem to contract and not release, especially in back of the upper leg and behind the knees and the overall joint and muscle pains throughout my body have increased. I can t stand or walk but a few minutes before the muscle cramping and pain kicks in. In the past I experienced hair loss a couple other times, but my doctor and I didn t know why. Now looking back I m sure it was due to the past cortisone injections I had for my knees and I assumed all the other symptoms were due to a fibromyalgia flare-up. I feel like I have aged and turned into my grandmother overnight this past winter. Even my own mother who had both hips and knees replaced moves better and is healthier than me. Is this all due to the cortisone injections? Is the fibromyalgia in hyper speed due to the injections? Could there be some other problem?

After taking an extra long time to heal and being in a cast and brace for over three months, I set about to rehabilitate and strengthen my grip, wrist and arm as well as restore flexibility. I still am not able to completely rotate my hand up or down in the supinated or pronated position. As a result, I have given myself a case of tennis elbow because extra torque is being placed on the elbow when I try to use my forearm or do arm exercises and stretches in the gym. I have been going to a physical therapist as well as wear a tennis elbow brace. It s gets better for a while and then gets aggravated again. I have developed a strange knot on the flat underside of my forearm up near the elbow that is very painful when palpated, almost like a searing pain as if something is torn. Neither my doctor nor my physical therapist can tell me what this knot is or what has caused it. The therapist has been using dry needling all around the elbow and forearm to help with the tennis elbow, but the knot won t go away. I could not see on anatomy diagrams that part of the forearm near the elbow to see if it could be a ligament or a nerve ending that may be aggravated. Do you think you could give me an idea of what this knot is and what to do about it? Also, if the hand does not get to the point of being able to rotate up and down completely, will the tennis elbow remain a problem? It has been suggested that I seek a second opinion with a hand specialist as the orthopedist who treated the broken arm told me he had done all he could do for me! Thanks, Ellen Picket","Doctor":"Sure, you do need consultation with orthopedist.Tennis elboww is treatable with local infilteration of hydrocortisone at the condyler level at elbow, given weekly for 3 times, wearing tennis elbow band, and avoiding torquing movement of elbow,means not rotating forearm or lifting weights.If there is malunion at lower end ulna, likely, since ROM (rotation) hampered, then excision surgery of lower end of ulna may be decided by the surgeon,but firstly, assessment should be made of both elbow and wristthanks"},{"Patient":"Left Shoulder injury of a right handed person. An ultrasound has verified that I have severe diffuse subscapularis tendinopathy, however no significant partial or full thickness tear is evident. There is minor infraspinatus calcific tendonitis.

I had a bursal injection & taken Celebrix & switched to Proxen. I have obtained no pain relief & becoming very frustrated at the lack of use of the shoulder & the extreme pain caused by some (normal) movements. I ride a road bike (upright - not racing) to & from work daily & doing it gently, to minimise bumps to the shoulder.

I welcome any ideas on what the problem may be & the appropriate course of action. thanks Peter","Doctor":"Thanks for the information.Depending on time since injury initial immobilization in a broad arm sling for 2-3 weeks is necessary to heal minor tears,bursitis,afterwards active shoulder exercises are begun very gently intermittently along-with oral anti-inflammatory for the period of pain.Gradually sling is discarded for longer periods of time intermittently.The process may take as long as 6 weeks to heal completely.After six weeks normal shoulder activity and muscle building exercises are indicated to bring back strength of shoulder.Also any diabetes should be ruled out with blood and urine testsI think it should heal with this regime"},{"Patient":"I just got home last night from vacation and was in the car for about 13 hours.

It appears to have a somewhat movable lump roughly the size of a golf ball, more towards the inner side, which is slightly red and warm to touch. I told him to go to the ER to have it looked at because he says it hurts very badly. What could this be and should he be seen immediately?","Doctor":"Brief answer:Planter fasciitis needing pain medications and steroid shot.Detailed answer:Hello,Based on what you told about your husband, it can be said with fair certainty that you husband is suffering from planter fasciitis.Plantar fasciitis mainly results in pain in the heel and bottom of the foot and is seen often in clinical setup. The pain is usually most severe with the first steps of the day or following a period of rest. Improvement of pain is usually seen with continued walking. The condition usually builds up slowly and cause intense pain.Your husband is most likely doing a job which require long periods of standing and he may also be obese.If I were your husband's doctor, I would first do an x-ray foot which usually show a heel spur although an absence of spur does not rule out fasciitis. An ultrasound heel also aids in making diagnosis.I usually advise best rest to patient to see whether the condition improves. Along with rest, painkiller like:Diclofenac K 50mg twice daily is advised to aid with bed rest. If this is not sufficient, a steroid injection is advised which is injected at the site of maximal pain on heel. Most of the patients improved in clinical setting after this remedy.Surgery is considered only after conservative treatment has failed to resolve the issue after six months and has been rarely needed.I shall be happy to assist you if you need further help.

I also had some blood twice in my stools (red ) a couple of months ago so I am now being given a flexible sigmoidoscopy for that. Do you think the duodenitis has got worse, what is it and what can I do about it in terms of diet and why does it go on for weeks at the time?Thanks","Doctor":"Hi.Thanks for your query and an elucidate history.This looks to be a ''symptom complex'' of varied problems . Let us solve one by one:The gall stones can cause varied symptoms from flatulence to soreness of stomach and is in fact a reason for duodenitis. I would suggest you to get the gall bladder removed by '' Laparoscopic Cholecystectomy \\"'. I hope most of your symptoms will get corrected. Omeprazole may not cause dairrhoea in all the patients. If it enhances in your case you can take take Ranitidine instead. Red ( fresh) blood in the stool is usually due to a local problem of piles or fissure. As a policy sigmoidoscopy should be done to rule out other problems. This can be a part of IBS you are suffering from. Duodenitis can not cause fresh/ red blood in stools. Diet: Fat-free diet, soft and bland is the best at the moment. The problem goes on for weeks as you have a symptom-complex, so some or the other problem will creep up. Go for Cholecystectomy and a proper medicines for IBS - you will be absolutely alright."},{"Patient":"I get the equivalent of a Charlie Horse directly in between my breasts/sternum sometimes when Ibend over (i.e., to pick something up even if light in weight).

Dr has told you Groin pain, which means Adductor muscles have been injured but according to your complaints (pain below his knee) my diagnosis is totally different.He might be suffering from Jumpers Knee.Jumpers knee or patellar tendonitis is pain in the tendon which attaches the kneecap or patella to the top of the shin bone or tibia. It is usually an overuse injury caused by repetitive strain.Patellar tendonitis can be a tricky condition to treat and requires a substantial period of rest and a thorough treatment and rehabilitation program. In the most severe or persistent cases, surgery may be required. Treatment for patella tendonitis consists of reducing the initial pain and inflammation through rest and ice followed by a rehabilitation program which will include eccentric strengthening exercises.Home treatment- Apply cold therapy on a regular basis, especially during the acute stage which is usually the first 24 to 48 hours and after any form of exercise.Professional treatment-anti-inflammatory medication e.g. ibuprofen. Do not take ibuprofen if you have asthma and check with a doctor before taking any medication. A patella tendon taping technique can be used to relieve pain and take the pressure off the tendon in the same way a patella strap works.A professional therapist may use electrotherapy in the form of ultrasound or laser treatment to reduce pain and inflammation and aid the healing process.Hope this answers your question.

First of all as the name of the disease suggests , this problem is increased by a psychological problem. Added upon are the social issues as you have rightly noted. The treatment plan has to be like this:::Stay away from STRESS of all sorts. This is the mainstay of the treatment; as you must have observed your problems are the least when there is no tension.Medical treatment is on the lines of Pre-pro or such probiotic tablets, There is a combination of medicines which will relax your bowel as well as mind. As these are prescription based you have to see a Doctor , preferably a Gastroenterologist to get the medicines. IF you follow this strictly, your life will be a changed one , absolutely normal and great social too. Do not worry , you do not have to live with this."},{"Patient":"When flying this week my knee became very swollen and painful and feels very full above the knee I can bend it backwards but bringing my leg up toward my chest at a 90 degree angle hurts, I want to make sure it is nothing severe before I fly again next week.

Recently (almost 8 years after surgery), I have consistent pain mainly in upper jaw and sometime in lower jaw. The pain is very random but sort of continuous.

I did not have any accident recently but as I mention this kind of sensation arises before (for short timings/a day or so) after I was recovering from operation.

How much minimum time taken to join the bone. 2. Almost 4 months has been past, as per Orthopedic Dr advise I am taken the x-ray of the my bone. and as per x-ray and Orthopedic Dr advise growth is minimum and need to open the bottom screw from nail then growth is more. 3. my insured leg is swelling to much from thigh to bottom of the leg. so how much time taken for normal leg.","Doctor":"Hi.1. Usually the plate and screws need to be left for at least a year, minimum2. There can occur such complications and if your doctor thinks the screws need to be removed to allow better ossification then that should be the case, but I can only accurately comment after looking at your xray3. It again depends on the rate of healing, usually with physiotherapy and good and early rehabilitation we can avoid such swelling and undesired side effectsBest wishes."},{"Patient":"Hii i was playing around w.

Is there any solution to my pain?","Doctor":"Hi.Thanks for your query and an elucidate history.The sticky bowel means there is intestinal obstruction causing the pain. In such a situation I advise my patient firsts to undergo a diagnostic procedure called Enteroclysis. In this a small nasogastric tube is passed into the small bowel and barium is given. Multiple X-rays are taken. These X-rays will give us few ideas :: Whether the obstruction is mild , moderate or severe. .The site of obstruction. And also gives the idea whether the surgery is needed and whether it will help you to become asymptomatic. Treatment:::First of all keep yourself only on liquid diet for about one week. If needed you can be admitted and given the intra-venous fluids . BY doing this the bowel/ intestines are given rest and the swelling of the strictured area is reduced. If this helps you may remain on liquid diet and be alright. IF there is no benefit , you need to undergo surgery to remove the obstruction. and you will be fine."},{"Patient":"I had knee replacement one year ago..the alignment has never felt right.

What do you think this is. My right knee was replaced prior to this one by the same surgeon, but with a different implant. It is a work of art.","Doctor":"Hi.The knee may be taking time to adjust to the hip replacement, granted it has been almost a year. Sometimes it may never feel the same way it did prior to surgery, and if at all the complaints persisit we also go ahead and redo the whole surgery on request by the patient.

I healed well but the spot is very tender for wearing his prosthesis for more than a few hours. Could this be osteoarthritis? He has had several fitting adjustments but can t seem to have any resolution for the discomfort/pain","Doctor":"Hi.We of course need to diagnose osteoarthritis using a few blood investigations, but other than this we can also use an xray of the region.

It is so painful I cannot move but if I grab them and hold them the pain will subside as long as I hold them in one place and not move. would a breast reduction help this problem?","Doctor":"Hi.It is not necessarily a breast size and structural problem but could be related to a hormonal cause. Make sure you wear a well fitted brassiere and also lose a little weight if you can. Breast reduction will only help if the ligaments holding the breast in place and so on are feeling the pressure due to the weight of the breasts.

Could it be something else, though?","Doctor":"Hi.Arthritis can cause inflammation of the bone that results in reduced space at the joint, and so possible friction between the bones in the hip (which is a ball and socket joint). So treatment of arthritis should be the primarily approach, physiotherapy is secondary.Best wishes."},{"Patient":"My girlfriend and my brother were goofing around and she acidently hit the top of her head pretty hard on our carpeted floor.

But the neck pain should probably be due to the impact and her body weight causing some amount of compression i  the neck/spine region.You can take her to a doctor but it is a choice, but if she starts exhibiting symptoms like nystagmus ( read about it), vomiting, nausea, visual disturbances, bleeding from any orifices (e.g. nose, ear, etc.), or loss of consciousness then it becomes mandatory to take her to the ER.Best wishes."},{"Patient":"2 months ago I fell on hardwood floor - my elbow took the brunt of the fall.

Possibilty of gastric disease or reflux disease is there based on your symptoms of past 2 months. Rexpro 40 is given to suppress acid and domperidone to prevent reflux of acid into food pipe.

Is there a way to go back in and remove anything that may still be in the knee area that is causing the persistent problem? Thank you","Doctor":"Hi.Of course, an arthroscopy would do just that. But in my opinion the more likely cause would be osteoarthritis which would have developed over the years due to the torn meniscus. So treating that would be more wise that any other approach.

I take Hydriconone for pain but it has n effect on the pain. Could a crack have been missed when reading the Xray ? What do you suggest I do?","Doctor":"Hi.A crack can be missed some times, especially if the xray is not taken in the right angle and you can go ahead with a repeat xray from different angles just to make sure we rule that out.

He will go for a gastroscopy after careful physical examination and assessment. Also ask him to go for a Complete blood count to see your hemoglobin levels.The treatment will be according to the diagnosis. But for now, start with Omeprazole before breakfast, until you get an appointment for consultation.Hope I answered all of your health concerns .

It has gotten a little more painful since then. I m a teacher so I ask the school nurse to look in my ear she said everything looked fine and that it might be tmj or tmd. I had all my wisdom teeth removed back 91 while in the USMC. I also just had my 2 upper back teeth removed in mid Nov 2013. I also grind my teeth at night. Does tmj or tmd sound like the right cause for my discomfort or should I see Gp for an ear infection?","Doctor":"Hi..Welcome to HEALTHCARE MAGIC..I have gone through your query and can understand your concerns..As per your complain in case of you have a habit of teeth grinding or Bruxism then the cause of discomfort while chewing or biting done seems to be most probably due to TEMPOROMANDIBULAR JOINT Dysfunction and you need to consult an Oral Physician and get evaluated..He can advise you a full mouth x Ray known as ORTHOPANTOMOGRAM or OPG to evaluate your jaw joints and also all your teeth to rule out the exact cause of problem and treatment can be done accordingly..You can be advised mouth splints, mouth guards and physiotherapy to relieve the discomfort and Bruxism habit.As of now you can take anti-inflammatory painkillers like Ibuprofen, muscle relaxant like Chlorzoxasone..Take soft diet and avoid excess mouth opening..Massage the muscles of sides of face in round motion gently with finger tips..Hope this information helps..Thanks and regards.Dr.Honey Nandwani Arora."},{"Patient":"Hi,I am a parent (49 years o9ld) and am asking about my 16 year old son's ingrown toenail condition.

After about 4 weeks the skin broke and a large \\"globular\\" jelly like thing came away from my shin. I am attending a clinic twice weekly to have the now, open wound, cleaned and dressed with a 'moisture' type dressing and padded bandaging.  I have no 'real'  pain from this wound but it seems to be taking a very long time to actually heal.  I do ask about the healing time but am constantly told to be patient.  I would be interested to hear if this 'healing time' is acceptable or should I be seeking a second opinion. Thank you, I look forward to your advice. Patricia McKenzie","Doctor":"Hi..Welcome to HEALTHCARE MAGIC..I have gone through your query and can understand your concerns..As per your complain it seems that the globular jelly that has came out of your skin after rupturing the skin seems to be a Hematoma that was formed due to rupture of blood vessels secondary to injury and accumulation of blood in soft tissues..As due to injury that has been a loss of tissue in the area of the wound there is formation of a crater or a hole and it can take a longer time to resolve as gradually when the tissues will reform and fill the area..In case if you do not have any pain in the area there is a possibility that there is no infection or inflammation and just the tissues need to reform.Dressing and keeping the wound packed will help in preventing infection as well as dessication of the tissues and will promote faster healing, so as of now continue with the procedure.. You should keep patience and let the treatment carried on but in case if you have any doubt you can consult an Orthopedician and get evaluated and a clinical examination seems sufficient to rule out the cause and treat you accordingly.Hope this information helps..Thanks and regards.Dr.Honey Nandwani Arora."},{"Patient":"Hi, I hit my shin very hard in a football game a week ago.

I have gone to three doctors, and they have all diagnosed the problem as elbow tendonitis. however I believe it is a bone spur. I believe this because I recently broke a bone and had to undergo bed rest for two months. instead of getting better, my pain got considerably worst. I believe this is because the spur is rubbing against the bed sheets. when I attempted to discuss this with a doctor, he got noticeably defensive and said that there is no evidence that bone spurs cause pain, and even if they did there is nothing that can be done about it. what is the truth here? Doctor s reply to your question above... Hello, Thanks for posting your query. Bone spur itself is not painful but if it causes compression of the adjoining soft tissues or cause inflammation of the surrounding tendons then it can cause pain. Bone spurs if these are symptomatic can be removed surgically or local steroid injections can be given to decrease the inflammation. You can get an X-ray of your elbow in lateral view to detect any bony spurs in the area. A soft tissue abnormality like tendonitis can be best diagnosed with MRI scan. I hope this answers your query. In case you have additional questions or doubts, you can forward them to me, and I shall be glad to help you out. Wishing you good health. Regards. Dr. Praveen Tayal. For future query, you can directly approach me through my profile URL  second question thanks. can you please direct me about what to do next, to actively address the pain? of course, i have had a x-ray. the x-ray appears, to me, to show a visible bone spur. however all my doctors have informed me that this is not a bone spur, but is instead a calcium deposit . this deposit, or whatever one calls it, appears to have grown considerably in the last two years. all my doctors have told me that this is not a problem, and that the calcium deposit will eventually be re-absorbed into the muscle. again, all my doctors have consistently informed me that this deposit will not cause pain. I have requested a MRI to confirm that it is actually tendonitis, instead of a bone spur, but they have said that a MRI would be a waste of time. these are the best orthopedic doctors in this city (Gainesville Fl) and are well respected. if I were to proceed to the next step, to challenge their diagnosis, I would need to travel to another city. what should I do?","Doctor":"Hi! I feel that given the fact that the seemingly best Orthopedicians of Gainesville, Florida have come to a diagnosis and conclusion that you strongly differ with, you have the full right to contest this diagnosis. If you do not get all the doubts out of your mind, you will feel miserable. Since, it's just a matter of a radiological examination, I suggest that you get this done, the MRI, I mean, in a different city. It is definitely worth the time, money and energy spent to do this. Imagine how good you'll feel at the end of it. Note that I have not argued nor contested any doctor's diagnosis. Please make arrangements to visit a nearby city where you can get this done. Thanks.

Other reasons why sweeling and red spots appear could be any peripheral disorder like DVT, sometimes when BP raises high you suffer from edema and itchiness because of which red spots appear.So in such case let me recommend you to please take some precautions and if it appears again then immediately contact some doctor to rule out the exact reason by various investigation procedures:1. Try to elevate your legs whenever you are lying down, to a position above your heart.2. Immediately do some ice massage over the area.3. Perform some calf exercises so that blood circulation is maintained.4. Wear stockings during your travel.5. Wear loose fitting clothing.6. Do not sit in one position for long. Try to change position frequently.7. Avoid a position in which you have to hang your legs.8. In office place small stoll under your foot while sitting and change the positions so that your leg does not comes directly in against gravity position as there are chances of increase in sweeling.Please follow the above instructions/treatment. If still there is no relief then as an advice please visit some near by doctor for investigation as there may be chances of DVT or any thrombotic problem..Good Luck and Get Well Soon"},{"Patient":"I ve been having severe pain in my wrist when I move my thumb with swelling in the fatty tissue.

There are many reasons for this like carpal tunnel syndrome, peripheral nerve disorder, arthritis, in diabetis also this problem occurs etc. Due to smoking also your nerves get weak and this problem occurs. So in such I would recommend you to consult some neuro physio who can diagnose it and can give you the exact reason for numbness.  In the meantime to get relief from this let me recommend you some home treatment:1. Take a warm water in a small tub or bucket. Place your hand in it for 5 - 10 minutes and then using other thumb massage your affected area. As it will increase the blood flow of the numb area and give your relief.2. After taking above hot fermentation perform some exercises like: Elevate your hand and then make a fist and open it, use use spongy (smily) ball press it tightly as much as you can and then release, you can also do finger counting exercise with thumb, and tie a rubber band over thumb and then stretch it by doing flexion, abduction movements.3. Once done with the exercise relax yourself by keeping your hand in elevation position for 10-15 minutes.Please take some precautions:1. Avoid drinking and smoking as much as you can.2. Avoid excess eating, specially citrus fruits, fat products like ghee butter etc., diary products for time being, junk food, fry food etc3. You can have healthy food items like bananas and leafy, green vegetables etc.4. Nowadays in winter do not keep your hand open, try to wear glooves and keep them warm.5. Keep your arm elevated to increase blood supply.6. If there is very much numbness you can have hot cold pack by checking if it is not more hot or cold from other hand. Apply in the ratio of 2:1.7. If require then only take medicine.Please follow the above treatment you will get a relief."},{"Patient":"Hi Dr, Hope all is well.

Initially it was taken care of by using 3 screws to hold it together, but over the course of about 9 months the screws started coming out and my leg shrunk up about 2 inches in the process. I ve since had hip replacement surgery, in which I had my muscles/nerves in my leg stretched almost back to where they were. now, I do have some pain in the incision area, but most of the pain generates from under my knee, shin, calve and in my ankles. I m sure it s due to stretching the tendons and or nerves but my question is, what is the average time period in which it takes for something like this to heal if at all?","Doctor":"hello,I have studied your case and your pain is not due to stretching.
