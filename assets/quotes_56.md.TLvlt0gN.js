Base Case (m = 2):   For (m = 2), the inequality becomes:   (2-1)^{2-1}(x_1^2 + x_2^2) geq (x_1 + x_2)^2 - 2^2 x_1 x_2.   Simplifying, we get:   x_1^2 + x_2^2 geq x_1^2 + x_2^2 + 2x_1 x_2 - 4x_1 x_2,   which simplifies to:   x_1^2 + x_2^2 geq 2x_1 x_2.   This is true by the AM-GM inequality, which states (x_1^2 + x_2^2 geq 2x_1 x_2).2. General Case (m geq 3):   Without loss of generality (WLOG), assume (x_1 + x_2 + cdots + x_m = 1). We aim to minimize the function:   f(x_1, x_2, ldots, x_m) = (m-1)^{m-1}(x_1^m + x_2^m + cdots + x_m^m) + m^m x_1 x_2 cdots x_m,   subject to the constraint:   g(x_1, x_2, ldots, x_m) = x_1 + x_2 + cdots + x_m = 1.      Using the method of Lagrange multipliers, we set:   nabla f = lambda nabla g,   where (lambda) is a constant. The gradient of (g) is:   nabla g = (1, 1, ldots, 1).      For the function (f), the partial derivatives are:   frac{partial f}{partial x_i} = (m-1)^{m-1} cdot m x_i^{m-1} + m^m cdot frac{partial (x_1 x_2 cdots x_m)}{partial x_i}.      Setting (nabla f = lambda nabla g), we get:   (m-1)^{m-1} cdot m x_i^{m-1} + m^m cdot frac{partial (x_1 x_2 cdots x_m)}{partial x_i} = lambda.      For (x_i neq 0), the partial derivative of the product (x_1 x_2 cdots x_m) with respect to (x_i) is:   frac{partial (x_1 x_2 cdots x_m)}{partial x_i} = frac{x_1 x_2 cdots x_m}{x_i}.      Therefore, we have:   (m-1)^{m-1} cdot m x_i^{m-1} + m^m cdot frac{x_1 x_2 cdots x_m}{x_i} = lambda.      For (x_i = x_j) for all (i, j), we get:   x_1 = x_2 = cdots = x_m = frac{1}{m}.      Substituting (x_i = frac{1}{m}) into the inequality, we get:   (m-1)^{m-1} cdot m left(frac{1}{m}right)^{m-1} + m^m left(frac{1}{m}right)^m = lambda.      Simplifying, we get:   (m-1)^{m-1} cdot frac{1}{m^{m-1}} + 1 = lambda.      This shows that the equality holds when (x_1 = x_2 = cdots = x_m = frac{1}{m}).3. Conclusion:   The inequality holds for all non-negative real numbers (x_1, x_2, ldots, x_m) with (m geq 2), and equality holds when (x_1 = x_2 = cdots = x_m = frac{1}{m}).The final answer is ( boxed{ (m-1)^{m-1}(x_1^m + x_2^m + cdots + x_m^m) geq (x_1 + x_2 + cdots + x_m)^m - m^m x_1 x_2 cdots x_m } )."},{"problem":"3.

For (frac{1}{81})^{frac{1}{4}}:- Observing that 81 = 3^4, so frac{1}{81} = (frac{1}{3})^4.- Therefore, (frac{1}{3})^4)^{frac{1}{4}} = frac{1}{3}.3. For 0.027^{-frac{1}{3}}:- Recognizing that 0.027 = frac{27}{1000} = (frac{3}{10})^3.- Thus, (frac{3}{10})^3)^{-frac{1}{3}} = frac{10}{3}.4. For log_{6}2 + frac{1}{1+log_{3}2}:- Rewrite frac{1}{1+log_{3}2} as frac{1}{log_{3}3+log_{3}2}, which simplifies to frac{1}{log_{3}(3 cdot 2)} by the product rule of logarithms.- This gives us frac{1}{log_{3}6}.- Observing that log_{6}2 + log_{6}3 = log_{6}(2 cdot 3) = log_{6}6 = 1, since log_{base}(base) = 1.Putting it all together, we calculate the expression as follows:{9}^{frac{1}{2}log_{3}10}+(frac{1}{81})^{frac{1}{4}}-0.027^{-frac{1}{3}}+log_{6}2+frac{1}{1+log_{3}2} = 10 + frac{1}{3} - frac{10}{3} + 1 = 10 - 3 + frac{1}{3} + 1 = 8 + frac{1}{3} - frac{1}{3} = 8.Hence, the answer is: boxed{8}."},{"problem":"2.

Substituting this into Lambda yieldsbegin{aligned}& (x+1)(k x(x-1)+c)-(x-1)(k x(x+1)+c) = & k x(x+1)(x-1)+c(x+1)-k x(x+1)(x-1)-c(x-1)=2 c .end{aligned}Hence, P(x)=k x(x+1)+c=k x^{2}+k x+c is a solution to the given equation for any constant k.

So |A| ≤ 41. But a value of 41 is certainly possible, for example, exclude 2, 8, 14, ... , 44. The largest excluded element must be at least 44 (or we have the 6 consecutive elements 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49). The smallest excluded element must be at most 6. If we exclude 2 and 44, then the difference between them is 7·6 and so the other 6 excluded elements are fixed. But if we exclude 3 and 44, for example, then there are several possible choices for the other elements. There are 5 ways of choosing the smallest and largest excluded element to get a difference of 7·6 between them (2 and 44, 3 and 45, 4 and 46, 5 and 47, 6 and 48). There are 4 ways to get a difference of 7·6 - 1 (3 and 44, 4 and 45, 5 and 46, 6 and 47). There are 3 ways to get a difference of 7·6 - 2 (4 and 44, 5 and 45, 6 and 46), 2 ways to get a difference of 7·6 - 3 (5 and 44, 6 and 45), and 1 way to get a difference of 7·6 - 4 (6 and 44). If the difference is 7·6 - 1, then we can shorten any of the 7 gaps, so there are 7 possibilities. For example, with 3 and 44, we could shorten the first gap, so excluding 3, 8, 14, 20, 26, 32, 38 and 44, or the second gap, so excluding 3, 9, 14, 20, 26, 32, 38 and 44, and so on. If the difference is 7·6 - 2, then we can shorten one gap by two (7 possibilities) or two gaps by one (21 possibilities), total 28. If the difference is 7·6 - 3, then we can shorten on gap by three (7), one by two and one by one (42) or three by one (35), total 84. Finally, if the difference is 7·6 - 4, we can shorten one by four (7), one by three and one by 1 (42), two by two (21), one by two and two by one (105), or four by one (35), total 210.

Finally, we can plug in z and use the Pythagorean theorem to find the height of the trapezoid.[frac{12^4}{13^2} + x^2 = 12^2 implies x^2 = frac{(12^2)(13^2)}{13^2} -frac{12^4}{13^2}  implies x^2 = frac{(12 cdot 13)^2 - (144)^2}{13^2} implies x^2 = frac{(156+144)(156-144)}{13^2} implies x = sqrt{frac{3600}{169}} = frac{60}{13}]Now that we have the height of the trapezoid, we can multiply this by the median to find our answer.The median of the trapezoid is frac{39+52}{2} = frac{91}{2}, and multiplying this and the height of the trapezoid gets us:[frac{60 cdot 91}{13 cdot 2} = boxed{mathrm{(C)} 210}]Solution 4We construct a line segment parallel to overline{AD} from point C to line overline{AB}, and label the intersection of this segment with line overline{AB} as point E. Then quadrilateral AECD is a parallelogram, so CE=5, AE=39, and EB=13. Triangle EBC is therefore a right triangle, with area frac12 cdot 5 cdot 12 = 30.By continuing to split overline{AB} and overline{CD} into segments of length 13, we can connect these vertices in a \\"zig-zag,\\" creating seven congruent right triangles, each with sides 5,12, and 13, and each with area 30. The total area is therefore 7 cdot 30 = boxed{textbf{(C)} 210}.Alternative: Instead of creating seven congruent right triangles, we can find the height of parallelogram AECD by drawing an altitude from D to side AE, creating the new point F. By recognizing that triangle DAF is similar to triangle BEC, we can use properties of similar triangles and find that DE = 12 cdot frac{5}{13} = frac{60}{13}. Thus, the area of parallelogram AECD is frac{60}{13} cdot 39 = 180. Finally, we add the areas of the parallelogram AECD and the right triangle BEC together and we get 180 + 30 = boxed{textbf{(C)} 210}. ~scarletsycSolution 2 but quickerFrom Solution 2 we know that the the altitude of the trapezoid is frac{60}{13} and the triangle's area is 30.Note that once we remove the triangle we get a rectangle with length 39 and height frac{60}{13}.The numbers multiply nicely to get 180+30=boxed{(C) 210}-harsha12345Quick Time Trouble Solution 5First note how the answer choices are all integers.The area of the trapezoid is frac{39+52}{2} cdot h = frac{91}{2} h. So h divides 2. Let x be 2h. The area is now 91x. Trying x=1 and x=2 can easily be seen to not work. Those make the only integers possible so now you know x is a fraction. Since the area is an integer the denominator of x must divide either 13 or 7 since 91 = 13cdot7.Seeing how 39 = 3cdot13 and 52 = 4cdot13 assume that the denominator divides 13. Letting y = frac{x}{13} the area is now 7y.Note that (A) and (C) are the only multiples of 7. We know that A doesn't work because that would mean h is 4 which we ruled out.

Market research shows that for every 1 yuan increase in the selling price, the daily sales will decrease by 10 items. The pricing department stipulates that the selling price cannot exceed 12 yuan. Let the selling price of the souvenir be x (yuan), the daily sales be y (items), and the daily sales profit be w (yuan).  (1) Find the functional relationship between y and x;  (2) Find the functional relationship between the daily sales profit w (yuan) and the selling price x (yuan). For what value of x is the daily sales profit maximized, and what is the maximum profit?","solution":"To solve this problem, let's break it down into the two parts as requested: Part 1: Functional Relationship Between y and xGiven that when the selling price is 8 yuan, Xiao Li can sell 200 items per day. For every 1 yuan increase in the selling price, the daily sales decrease by 10 items. We can express this relationship as follows:- When x = 8, y = 200.- For every 1 yuan increase in x, y decreases by 10 items.This can be modeled by the equation y = 200 - 10(x - 8). Simplifying this equation gives us:[y = 200 - 10x + 80][y = -10x + 280]Therefore, the functional relationship between y and x is boxed{y = -10x + 280} for 6 leqslant x leqslant 12. Part 2: Functional Relationship Between Daily Sales Profit w and Selling Price xThe daily sales profit w can be calculated by multiplying the profit per item by the number of items sold. The profit per item is (x - 6), and the number of items sold is given by the relationship we found in part 1, y = -10x + 280. Therefore, the daily sales profit w is:[w = (x - 6)(-10x + 280)]Expanding this and completing the square gives us:[w = -10x^2 + 280x - 60x + 1680][w = -10x^2 + 220x + 1680][w = -10(x^2 - 22x - 168)][w = -10(x^2 - 22x + 121) + 1210][w = -10(x - 11)^2 + 1210]Since the coefficient of x^2 is negative (-10), the parabola opens downwards, indicating that the maximum value of w occurs at the vertex of the parabola. The vertex form of the equation is already given by w = -10(x - 11)^2 + 1210, so the vertex is at (11, 1210). However, we are constrained by the stipulation that x cannot exceed 12 yuan. Therefore, we need to evaluate w at x = 12:[w = (12 - 6)(-10(12) + 280)][w = 6(-120 + 280)][w = 6 times 160][w = 960]Thus, when x = 12, the daily sales profit is maximized, and the maximum profit is boxed{960} yuan."},{"problem":"Given the function f(x) = begin{cases} 2^{1-x}, & x leqslant 1  1 - log_{2}x, & x > 1 end{cases}, find the value(s) of x that satisfy f(x) = 2.","solution":"Since f(x) = begin{cases} 2^{1-x}, & x leqslant 1  1 - log_{2}x, & x > 1 end{cases} and we are looking for the values of x that satisfy f(x) = 2, we have two cases to consider based on the piecewise definition of the function.1.

Color red the midpoints of all segments determined by them. What is the minimum number of red points created?","solution":"I. solution. The given points determine a finite number of lines. Thus, there exists a line that is not parallel to any of these. Draw a parallel line to one of these through each of the given points. These parallel lines are all different from each other. Intersect these parallel lines with another line. The set of intersection points consists of as many points as the given point set, and the elements of the two sets are mapped to each other by the parallel lines in a one-to-one correspondence. By coloring the midpoints of the segments determined by these intersection points blue, we can conclude that there are at most as many blue points as red ones, since if the midpoints of two pairs of the given points coincide, then the midpoints of the images of these pairs (their parallel projections) also coincide. Let the number of given points be n. Let the two extreme points among the intersection points be A and B, and the midpoint of AB be F.The number of blue points is at least 2(n-2)+1=2n-3, for by reducing the middle n-2 intersection points to half from the midpoint of A, and from the midpoint of B, we get all blue points, of which the former are all interior points of the segment AF, and the latter are all interior points of the segment BF, and the point F is also blue. Consequently, the number of red points is also at least 2n-3.The number of red points can be 2n-3, for example, if the points A_1, A_2, ldots, A_n are taken at the points 1, 2, ldots, n of a number line. In this case, the midpoints are precisely the fractions with a denominator of 2 between 1 and n, so their number is exactly 2n-3.II. solution. If n=1, then no midpoint is created. We will show that if 2 leq n, then the minimum number of red points is 2n-3.First, if A_i is the point on the number line that marks the number i-1, then exactly those points will be red that mark a positive number greater than 0 but less than 2n-2; this is exactly 2n-3 points.Now we only need to show that for any arrangement of the points A_i, there will be this many red points. We prove this by complete induction on n.If n=2, then there is always exactly 1=2 cdot 2-3 red point. If n points always determine at least 2n-3 red points, then starting from the points A_1, ldots, A_{n+1}, we draw the convex hull C of the set P={A_1, ldots, A_n}.

The set P backslash {B}, by our inductive hypothesis, determines at least 2n-3 red points; let this set be F. The midpoints of the segments B_1B and B_2B do not coincide, and they cannot be elements of F either, since both points are closer to the line e than the midpoint of the segment B_1B_2, while the points of F are at least as far from e as the midpoint of the segment B_1B_2.

The goal is to transfer all n disks from column A to column C. Please design a method and estimate how many moves are required. The problem provides three columns A, B, C for use.","solution":"The typical significance of the Tower of Hanoi problem lies in first finding the algorithm, and then estimating its time complexity, specifically the number of moves required. The research on the algorithm is roughly as follows.Please consider practical scenarios, simulate with smaller-scale problems as a \\"sandbox exercise,\\" identify regular patterns, and then generalize to the general case.As shown in Figure 2-1, first move the top disk to column B, then move the next disk to column C, and finally move the disk from column B to column C, making a total of 3 moves. The Tower of Hanoi problem with ( n=2 ) is thus solved. Next, consider the problem with ( n=3 ). Since the problem with ( n=2 ) has been solved, the first step is to move the top two disks from column A to column B, then move the last disk from column A to column C. Finally, use the method for moving two disks to transfer the two disks from column B to column C, thus solving the Tower of Hanoi problem with ( n=3 ). The problem with ( n=4 ) can be solved similarly, leading to a chain reaction, solving the problems with ( n=5, n=6, cdots ) in sequence. Solving the Tower of Hanoi problem with ( n-1 ) disks will lead to the solution for ( n ) disks. This method is called a recursive algorithm.Algorithm Analysis: Let ( H(n) ) represent the number of moves required for the Tower of Hanoi problem with ( n ) disks. According to the algorithm, two ( n-1 ) disk problems need to be solved: first, move the top ( n-1 ) disks from column A to column B, then move the last disk from column A to column C, and finally move the ( n-1 ) disks from column B to column C. Therefore, we have:[ H(n) = 2H(n-1) + 1, quad H(1) = 1 quad (2-1)]( H(1) = 1 ) is the initial condition of the recurrence relation (2-1), meaning one disk requires one move.Thus, we get the sequence:[begin{array}{l}H(1) = 1, H(2) = 2 + 1 = 2^2 - 1, H(3) = 2(2^2 - 1) + 1 = 2^3 - 1, H(4) = 2(2^3 - 1) + 1 = 2^5 - 1.end{array}]We can prove by mathematical induction that ( H(n) = 2^n - 1 ).

Let point A have coordinates left(x_{1} ; 0right), and point C have coordinates left(x_{2} ; 0right). From the condition, it is clear that x_{1} < 0 and x_{2} > 0. Since x_{1} and x_{2} are the roots of the quadratic trinomial f(x), by Vieta's theorem, we have x_{1} cdot x_{2} = 12b, from which we get b = frac{x_{1} cdot x_{2}}{12} < 0.Let H be the point with coordinates (3 ; 0) (Fig. 11). Clearly, in the isosceles triangle A T C, the segment T H is the height, and therefore it is also the median. Thus, 3 - x_{1} = A H = H C = x_{2} - 3, from which we get x_{1} = 6 - x_{2}.Let M be the point with coordinates (0, 3). Since T H = T M = 3 and T A = T B, the right triangles A T H and B T M are equal by the leg and hypotenuse. Therefore, 3 - x_{1} = H A = M B = 3 - b, that is, x_{1} = b = frac{x_{1} cdot x_{2}}{12} (by Vieta's theorem), from which we find x_{2} = 12. Finally, x_{1} = 6 - x_{2} = 6 - 12 = -6 and b = x_{1} = -6.Another solution. As in the previous solution, let the abscissas of points A and C be x_{1} and x_{2}, respectively; we will also use the fact that point B has coordinates (0 ; b). Immediately, we understand that O A = |x_{1}| = -x_{1}, O C = |x_{2}| = x_{2}, and O B = |b| = -b.Let's find the second intersection of the circle with the y-axis, let this be point D with coordinates (0 ; d) (Fig. 12). The chords A C and B D of the circle intersect at the origin O; from the properties of the circle, we know that O A cdot O C = O B cdot O D. We get -x_{1} cdot x_{2} = -b cdot d, from which, replacing x_{1} cdot x_{2} with 12b by Vieta's theorem, we get d = 12.![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_05_06_b46fbd582cc3a82460aeg-40.jpg?height=521&width=571&top_left_y=83&top_left_x=437)Fig. 12: to the solution of problem 10.7It remains to note that triangle BTD is isosceles, and the midpoint of its base, point M, has coordinates (0 ; 3).

The sum of the roots, *m* + *n*, and the product of the roots, *mn*, can be found using Vieta's formulas, which state that for a quadratic equation ax^2 + bx + c = 0, the sum of the roots -b/a and the product of the roots c/a.Given the equation x^2 + x - 1001 = 0, we have:- a = 1- b = 1- c = -1001Using Vieta's formulas:1.

Case 1: ( y > 1 )   First, consider the equation modulo 8:   [ 5^z equiv x^2 pmod{8} ]   Since (5 equiv 5 pmod{8}), we have:   [ 5^z equiv 5 pmod{8} ]   The quadratic residues modulo 8 are (0, 1, 4). Therefore, (x^2 equiv 1 pmod{8}), which implies:   [ 5^z equiv 1 pmod{8} ]   This is only possible if (z) is even. Let (z = 2z'). Substituting (z = 2z') into the original equation, we get:   [ x^2 + 4^y = 5^{2z'} ]   This can be factored as:   [ (5^{z'} - x)(5^{z'} + x) = 4^y ]   Since (4^y = 2^{2y}), we have:   [ gcd(5^{z'} - x, 5^{z'} + x) mid gcd(2 cdot 5^{z'}, 2^{2y}) = 2 ]   Therefore, the factors (5^{z'} - x) and (5^{z'} + x) must be (2) and (2^{2y-1}) respectively. This gives us:   [ 5^{z'} - x = 2 ]   [ 5^{z'} + x = 2^{2y-1} ]   Adding these two equations, we get:   [ 2 cdot 5^{z'} = 2 + 2^{2y-1} ]   [ 5^{z'} = 1 + 2^{2y-2} ]   By Mihăilescu's theorem (also known as Catalan's conjecture), the only solution in natural numbers to the equation (x^a - y^b = 1) for (a, b > 1) is (3^2 - 2^3 = 1). Therefore, the only solution is:   [ 5^{z'} = 5 ]   [ z' = 1 ]   Substituting (z' = 1) back, we get:   [ x = 3 ]   [ 2^{2y-2} = 4 ]   [ 2y - 2 = 2 ]   [ y = 2 ]   Thus, we have the solution ((x, y, z) = (3, 2, 2)).2.

Let's test small values of (z):   - For (z = 1):     [ 5^1 - 4 = 1 ]     [ x = 1 ]     Thus, ((x, y, z) = (1, 1, 1)) is a solution.   - For (z = 2):     [ 5^2 - 4 = 21 ]     21 is not a perfect square.   - For (z = 3):     [ 5^3 - 4 = 121 ]     [ x = 11 ]     Thus, ((x, y, z) = (11, 1, 3)) is a solution.

This gives us a total of 4 times 3 times 2 times 1 = 24 ways.- Ways for Xiao Wang and Xiao Zhang to exchange cards: There are 2 specific people exchanging cards, while the other 2 cards are freely exchanged among the remaining 2 people. So, there are 2! = 2 ways for Xiao Wang and Xiao Zhang to exactly exchange cards (they either swap or don't swap, but here, \\"exactly exchange\\" implies one specific outcome), and 2! = 2 ways for the other two cards to be arranged.- Probability of Xiao Wang and Xiao Zhang exactly exchanging cards: frac{{C_2^1 times 2!}}{{4!}} = frac{2}{24} = frac{1}{12}.

Statement C:- Number of ways for exactly one person to draw their own card: This involves more complex derangements, but straightforwardly, there are 4 choices for who draws their own card, and the rest must not draw theirs, which doesn’t directly lead to a simple calculation as given in the original solution. However, the probability given in the original solution is frac{1}{3}, differing from the explanation provided.

Since h(b)=h(c), then h(h(b)+d)=h(h(c)+d) and so 1+b+h(d)=1+c+h(d) or b=c.Step 3: Show that k leq 2From Step 1, h(a+r k)=h(a)+2 r for all positive integers a and r.Suppose that k geq 3.When a=1, we obtain h(1+r k)=h(1)+2 r for each positive integer r.The values of h here form an infinite set of positive integers starting with h(1)+2 which are spaced 2 apart.When a=2, we obtain h(2+r k)=h(2)+2 r for each positive integer r.The values of h here form an infinite set of positive integers starting with h(2)+2 which are spaced 2 apart.When a=3, we obtain h(3+r k)=h(3)+2 r for each positive integer r.The values of h here form an infinite set of positive integers starting with h(3)+2 which are spaced 2 apart.Since k geq 3, then the inputs in these three sets are all distinct, since those in the first family give remainder 1 when divided by k, those in the second family give remainder 2 when divided by k, and those in the third family give remainder 3 (or possibly 0 if k=3 ). But the three sets of outputs h(1)+2 r, h(2)+2 r, h(3)+2 r must overlap eventually, as there can be only two disjoint infinite sets with common difference 2 .This is a contradiction, so we cannot have k geq 3, which means that k leq 2.Step 4: Show that k=2We know that k=1 or k=2.If h(1)=k=1, the equation h(1+r k)=h(1)+2 r becomes h(1+r)=1+2 r.Substituting n=1+r (or r=n-1 ) gives h(n)=1+2(n-1)=2 n-1.In this case,h(h(n)+m)=h(2 n-1+m)=2(2 n-1+m)-1=4 n+2 m-3and1+n+h(m)=1+n+2 m-1=n+2 mThese two expressions are not always equal for all n and m (for example, when n=m=2 ). Therefore, we cannot have k=1. Thus, k=2.Step 5: h(n)=n+1 when n is oddFrom h(1+r k)=h(1)+2 r and k=2, we obtain h(1+2 r)=2+2 r=(2 r+1)+1 and so h(n)=n+1 when n is odd.Step 6: h(n)=n+1 when n is evenFrom h(2+r k)=h(2)+2 r, we obtain h(2+2 r)=h(2)+2 r.If we can show that h(2)=3, then we will obtain h(2+2 r)=3+2 r as required.Since h(x) is even when x is odd and since h is one-to-one, then h(x) must be odd when x is even.In particular, h(2) is odd.From h(h(n)+m)=1+n+h(m) with n=2 and m=1, we get h(h(2)+1)=1+2+h(1) and so h(h(2)+1)=5.When n is even, the values of h(n) form an increasing sequence of odd positive integers.This is because h(2) is odd and so h(2)+2 r is odd and increasing as r increases, and so h(2+2 r)=h(2)+2 r is odd and increasing as r increases.Therefore, h(h(2)+1)=5 has to be the third smallest, or second smallest, or smallest value of h(n) when n is even.Since h(2+2 r)=h(2)+2 r, then the values of h(x) when x is even increase when x increases by 2 .This means that we must have h(6)=5 or h(4)=5 or h(2)=5.If h(6)=5, then h(h(2)+1)=5 gives h(2)+1=6 or h(2)=5, which cannot be the case, since h is one-to-one.If h(2)=5, then h(h(2)+1)=5 gives h(2)+1=h(2) which cannot be the case.Therefore, h(4)=5 and so h(2+2)=h(2)+2 which gives h(2)=5-2=3.We have shown that the function h(n)=n+1 satisfies the given condition and that no other function does, as required.Solution 2Let h be a function that satisfies the given properties, and consider the infinite set of lattice points of the form (m, h(m)), for m=1,2,3, ldots.Let a be a positive integer.When n=a and m=h(a), the functional equation is h(h(a)+h(a))=1+a+h(h(a)) or h(2 h(a))=1+a+h(h(a)).Thus, the point (2 h(a), 1+a+h(h(a))) is on the graph of y=h(x).When n=a and m=2 h(a), the functional equation becomesh(h(a)+2 h(a))=1+a+h(2 h(a))or h(3 h(a))=1+a+1+a+h(h(a))=2+2 a+h(h(a)).Thus, the point (3 h(a), 2+2 a+h(h(a))) is on the graph of y=h(x).Suppose that r is a positive integer and assume that h(r h(a))=(r-1)+(r-1) a+h(h(a)). When n=a and m=r h(a), the functional equation becomesh(h(a)+r h(a))=1+a+h(r h(a))=1+a+(r-1)+(r-1) a+h(h(a))=r+r a+h(h(a))or h((r+1) h(a))=r+r a+h(h(a)).Thus, if the point (r h(a),(r-1)+(r-1) a+h(h(a))) is on the graph of y=h(x), then the point ((r+1) h(a), r+r a+h(h(a))) is on the graph of y=h(x).This shows that the infinite set of points of the form (operatorname{sh}(a),(s-1)+(s-1) a+h(h(a))) for integers s geq 2 all lie on this graph.Note that to get from one point in this set to the next, we move h(a) units to the right and a+1 units up.In other words, this infinite set of points on the graph forms a line with slope frac{a+1}{h(a)}.Call this line L_{a}.Suppose that b is a positive integer with b neq a.A similar argument shows that the set of points (t h(b),(t-1)+(t-1) b+h(h(b))) for integers t geq 2 all lie on this graph, which thus form a line L_{b} with slope frac{b+1}{h(b)}.Now consider the points (n, h(n)) on the graph of y=h(x) where n is a positive integer that is a multiple of h(a) and is also a multiple of h(b).There are infinitely many such points (for example, n=w h(a) h(b) for positive integers w ). These points lie on both L_{a} and L_{b}, and so the slopes of these two lines must be equal. But this is true for every possible pair of distinct positive integers a and b.Therefore, the quantity frac{a+1}{h(a)} must be constant for all positive integers a. (Another way to see this is to let a=1 and let b range through all positive integers greater than 1.)In other words, frac{a+1}{h(a)}=frac{1}{c} for some constant c or h(a)=c a+c for all positive integers a. If a=1, then h(1)=c+c=2 c.Setting n=m=1 in the equation h(h(n)+m)=1+n+h(m), we obtain h(h(1)+1)=1+1+h(1) which gives h(2 c+1)=2+2 c.Since h(a)=c a+c, then setting a=2 c+1 gives c(2 c+1)+c=2+2 c or 2 c^{2}+2 c=2+2 c and so c^{2}=1.Since c>0, then c=1 and so h(n)=n+1.(Solution 1 shows us that the function h(n)=n+1 does satisfy the requirements.)"},{"problem":"10 Given three positive numbers a, b, c satisfying a leqslant b+c leqslant 3 a, 3 b^{2} leqslant a(a+c) leqslant 5 b^{2}, then the minimum value of frac{b-2 c}{a} is qquad","solution":"(10) Given the inequality can be transformed intobegin{array}{r}1 leqslant frac{b}{a}+frac{c}{a} leqslant 3, 3left(frac{b}{a}right)^{2} leqslant 1+frac{c}{a} leqslant 5left(frac{b}{a}right)^{2} .end{array}Let frac{b}{a}=x, frac{c}{a}=y, then we haveleft{begin{array}{l}1 leqslant x+y leqslant 3, 3 x^{2} leqslant 1+y leqslant 5 x^{2} x>0, y>0 .end{array}right.It represents the shaded region A B C D (as shown in the figure).

Suppose that the original circle has radius R.Thus, the circumference of this circle is 2 pi R.When this circle is cut into two pieces and each piece is curled to make a cone, the ratio of the lateral surface areas of these cones is 2: 1.This means that the ratio of the areas of the two pieces into which the circle is cut is 2: 1 since it is these pieces that become the lateral surfaces of the cones.In other words, the sector cut out is frac{1}{3} of the area of the circle, which means that its central angle is frac{1}{3} of the total angle around the centre, or frac{1}{3} times 360^{circ}=120^{circ}.Since the central angles of the two pieces are 240^{circ} and 120^{circ}, which are in the ratio 2: 1, then the circumference is split in the ratio 2: 1 when the circle is cut.Since the circumference of the original circle is 2 pi R, then the lengths of the pieces of the circumference are frac{4}{3} pi R and frac{2}{3} pi R.These pieces become the circumferences of the circular bases of the two cones.Since the ratio of the circumference to the radius of a circle is 2 pi: 1, then the radii of the bases of the two cones are frac{frac{4}{3} pi R}{2 pi}=frac{2}{3} R and frac{frac{2}{3} pi R}{2 pi}=frac{1}{3} R.Since the radius of the original circle becomes the slant height of each cone, then the slant height in each cone is R.In a cone, the radius and the height are perpendicular forming a right-angled triangle with the slant height as its hypotenuse.Therefore, the height of a cone with slant height R and radius frac{2}{3} R issqrt{R^{2}-left(frac{2}{3} Rright)^{2}}=sqrt{R^{2}-frac{4}{9} R^{2}}=sqrt{frac{5}{9} R^{2}}=frac{sqrt{5}}{3} RAlso, the height of a cone with slant height R and radius frac{1}{3} R issqrt{R^{2}-left(frac{1}{3} Rright)^{2}}=sqrt{R^{2}-frac{1}{9} R^{2}}=sqrt{frac{8}{9} R^{2}}=frac{sqrt{8}}{3} RThe volume of a cone with radius frac{2}{3} R and height frac{sqrt{5}}{3} R is frac{1}{3} pileft(frac{2}{3} Rright)^{2}left(frac{sqrt{5}}{3} Rright) which equals frac{4 sqrt{5}}{81} pi R^{3}.

Given Information and Initial Setup:   We are given that (a, b, c) are non-zero integers and the sums (frac{a}{b} + frac{b}{c} + frac{c}{a}) and (frac{b}{a} + frac{c}{b} + frac{a}{c}) are integers. We need to find these sums.2. Polynomial Construction:   Consider the monic cubic polynomial (f(x)) with roots (frac{a}{b}, frac{b}{c}, frac{c}{a}). By Vieta's formulas, the sum of the roots taken one at a time, the sum of the products of the roots taken two at a time, and the product of the roots are related to the coefficients of the polynomial.3. Sum of the Roots:   The sum of the roots of (f(x)) is given by:   [   frac{a}{b} + frac{b}{c} + frac{c}{a}   ]   This is given to be an integer.4.

Product of the Roots:   The product of the roots is:   [   frac{a}{b} cdot frac{b}{c} cdot frac{c}{a} = 1   ]   This is clearly an integer (specifically, 1).6. Application of the Rational Root Theorem:   By the Rational Root Theorem, since (frac{a}{b}, frac{b}{c}, frac{c}{a}) are roots of a polynomial with integer coefficients, these roots must be rational numbers. Given that their product is 1, the only possible values for these roots are (pm 1).7. Possible Values for the Roots:   Since (frac{a}{b}, frac{b}{c}, frac{c}{a} in {-1, 1}), we have:   [   left|frac{a}{b}right| = left|frac{b}{c}right| = left|frac{c}{a}right| = 1   ]   This implies (|a| = |b| = |c|).8. Possible Sums:   The possible values for (frac{a}{b}, frac{b}{c}, frac{c}{a}) are either all 1 or all -1. Therefore, the sums are:   [   frac{a}{b} + frac{b}{c} + frac{c}{a} = 1 + 1 + 1 = 3   ]   or   [   frac{a}{b} + frac{b}{c} + frac{c}{a} = -1 + -1 + -1 = -3   ]9.

What is the largest possible value of Y?","solution":"To solve this problem, we need to determine the largest possible value of ( Y ) that Nils can ensure as his final fortune after ( n ) moves. We will use induction to prove that ( Y(n) = frac{2^n}{n+1} ).1. Base Case:   - When ( n = 1 ), there is one red marble and one black marble. Nils should bet ( x = 0 ) to ensure his fortune does not decrease, as betting any positive amount could result in a loss if the black marble is drawn. Therefore, ( Y(1) = 1 ).2. Inductive Step:   - Assume that for ( k ) red marbles, the largest possible ( Y ) is ( Y(k) = frac{2^k}{k+1} ).   - We need to show that for ( n = k+1 ) red marbles, the largest possible ( Y ) is ( Y(k+1) = frac{2^{k+1}}{(k+1)+1} = frac{2^{k+1}}{k+2} ).3. Inductive Hypothesis:   - Suppose Nils bets ( x ) when there are ( n ) red marbles and one black marble. The fortune after drawing a red marble will be ( y + x ), and after drawing a black marble, it will be ( y - x ).   - The expected fortune after one move should be equal to the largest possible ( Y ) for ( n-1 ) red marbles, which is ( Y(n-1) ).4. Expected Value Calculation:   - The expected value of Nils' fortune after one move is given by:     [     frac{n}{n+1}(y + x) + frac{1}{n+1}(y - x)     ]   - Simplifying this, we get:     [     frac{n(y + x) + (y - x)}{n+1} = frac{ny + nx + y - x}{n+1} = frac{(n+1)y + (n-1)x}{n+1}     ]5. Ensuring Final Fortune ( Y ):   - To ensure a final fortune of ( Y ), we need:     [     frac{(n+1)y + (n-1)x}{n+1} geq Y(n-1)     ]   - Solving for ( x ), we get:     [     (n+1)y + (n-1)x geq (n+1)Y(n-1)     ]     [     (n-1)x geq (n+1)Y(n-1) - (n+1)y     ]     [     x geq frac{(n+1)Y(n-1) - (n+1)y}{n-1}     ]6. Substituting ( Y(n-1) ):   - Using the inductive hypothesis ( Y(n-1) = frac{2^{n-1}}{n} ), we get:     [     x geq frac{(n+1)frac{2^{n-1}}{n} - (n+1)y}{n-1}     ]     [     x geq frac{(n+1)2^{n-1} - n(n+1)y}{n(n-1)}     ]7. Final Calculation:   - To ensure the largest possible ( Y ), we need to maximize ( x ). Setting ( y = frac{2^n}{n+1} ), we get:     [     x = frac{2^{n-1} - frac{2^n}{n+1}}{2^{n-1} + frac{2^n}{n+1}}     ]     [     x = frac{2^{n-1}(n+1) - 2^n}{2^{n-1}(n+1) + 2^n}     ]     [     x = frac{2^{n-1}n + 2^{n-1} - 2^n}{2^{n-1}n + 2^{n-1} + 2^n}     ]     [     x = frac{2^{n-1}n - 2^{n-1}}{2^{n-1}n + 2^{n-1} + 2^n}     ]     [     x = frac{2^{n-1}(n - 1)}{2^{n-1}(n + 1) + 2^n}     ]     [     x = frac{n - 1}{n + 1 + 2}     ]     [     x = frac{n - 1}{n + 3}     ]Thus, the largest possible value of ( Y ) that Nils can ensure is ( frac{2^n}{n+1} ).The final answer is ( boxed{ frac{2^n}{n+1} } )."},{"problem":"Given a sequence {a_n} that satisfies a_{n+1} = a_n - a_{n-1} (for n geq 2), with a_1 = 1 and a_2 = 3.

In fact we will prove a stronger statement, namely, that no multiple of n can be expressed as the sum of at most 100 powers of 2.For the sake of contradiction, suppose that there exists a positive integer c such that c n is the sum of at most 100 powers of 2 .

Consider the following two cases:- If a_{r} geq 101, then 2^{a_{r}}-2^{a_{r}-101}=2^{a_{r}-101} n. It follows that 2^{a_{1}}+2^{a_{2}}+cdots+2^{a_{r-1}}+2^{a_{r}-101} would be a multiple of n that is smaller than c n.

Choose (n) large enough and odd so that (sqrt[n]{q}) is irrational. Setting (a_1 = a_2 = ldots = a_n = sqrt[n]{q}), we obtain:   [   f(q) = fleft(n sqrt[n]{q}right)   ]   This shows that (f) evaluated at any rational number (q) is equal to (f) evaluated at some irrational number.4.

The two points corresponding to this angle, say A_{i} and A_{j}, must have a distance not greater than 1.(2) Now, prove the original proposition.Let A_{1} be the point among all points with the fewest lines of length not greater than 1 to other points, and assume A_{1} is connected to A_{2}, A_{3}, cdots, A_{m+1} with lines of length not greater than 1; let the set M=left{A_{1}, A_{2}, cdots, A_{m+1}right}, and the set N be the set of the remaining points.

Indeed, from this, the x^{2}, x^{3}, and x^{4} terms are missing:K^{2}=1+x-frac{7}{128} x^{5}+frac{7}{512} x^{6}-frac{5}{1024} x^{7}+frac{25}{16384} x^{8}Furthermore, the absolute value of the x^{5} term is smaller than the value of the sixth decimal place for each prescribed x value, since even for the largest absolute value of x = pm 0.1,left|frac{7}{128} cdot x^{5}right| = left|frac{7}{140} cdot x^{5}right| = left|0.05 cdot x^{5}right| = 0.0000005and therefore, in the rounding of the sought values to six decimal places, it must still be considered, on the other hand, that the sum of the smaller terms can also modify the rounded value if they do not individually modify it.Consider the 3rd to 6th terms of K^{2} first for the prescribed negative x values, in which case all four terms are positive. For x = -0.1, calculating the first two significant digits, the -7x^{5}/128 term is less than 0.00000054. The next term, as we have seen, is one-fortieth of this, and the subsequent ones are even smaller, so the sum of the next three terms is less than three-fortieths of the third term, which is less than 0.00000005, and therefore the sum of the 3rd to 6th terms falls between 0.0000005 and 0.0000006. Taking into account the first two terms,K^{2}=1-0.1+0.0000005 ldots, text { rounded to } 0.900001The value of x = -0.05 is half of the previous x, so the third term is 1/2^{5} = 1/32 of the previous one, and is therefore less than if a 2 were written in the 8th decimal place, the next three terms are each less than one-eightieth of the third term, so the sum of the four terms does not reach half the value of the 6th decimal place, so in this case K^{2} = 1 - 0.05 = 0.95 = 0.950000. (The last form ends with four significant zeros.)Similarly, for x = -0.01, K^{2} = 0.990000.For the prescribed positive x values, the terms of K^{2} from the second onward are of alternating signs. Moreover, as we have seen, they are each smaller than the one preceding them. Therefore, the sum of the 5th and 6th terms is of the same sign as the 5th term, and in absolute value smaller than it; hence adding this sum to the 4th term does not change its sign, just as adding the 5th term alone would not change it, so the sum of the 4th to 6th terms is of the same sign as the 4th term, and in absolute value smaller than it.For x = +0.1, the third term of K^{2} is less than -0.00000053, the sum of the 4th to 6th terms is positive, and (rounding the one-fortieth part) less than 0.00000002, so the sum of the 3rd to 6th terms falls between -0.0000005 and -0.0000006, and thus must be rounded to -0.000001 (since the first two terms of K^{2} are a round number up to the 6th decimal place), K^{2} = 1.099999.For x = +0.05 and x = +0.01, the absolute value of the third term is less than half the value of the 6th decimal place, and even more so for the absolute value of the sum of the 3rd to 6th terms, so in these cases the value of K^{2} is 1.050000, or 1.010000.Sándor Horváth (Budapest, István I.

Find the limitations, if any, on the starting values x_0, in order that the above iteration converges to the desired value 1/a.","solution":"1. Initial Setup and Iteration Definition:   We are given the iteration formula:   [   x_{k+1} = x_k(2 - ax_k), quad k = 0, 1, 2, ldots   ]   where ( x_0 ) is the starting value and ( a > 0 ). We need to determine the limitations on ( x_0 ) such that the iteration converges to ( frac{1}{a} ).2. Analyzing the Iteration:   Let's analyze the behavior of the iteration. We start by examining the first few iterations:   [   x_1 = x_0(2 - ax_0)   ]   [   x_2 = x_1(2 - ax_1) = x_0(2 - ax_0)(2 - ax_0(2 - ax_0))   ]3. Condition for Convergence:   We need to ensure that the sequence ( {x_k} ) converges to ( frac{1}{a} ). For this, we need ( x_k ) to remain positive and bounded. Let's start by ensuring ( x_0 ) is within a suitable range.4. Initial Value Constraints:   - If ( 0 < x_0 < frac{2}{a} ):     - Clearly, ( 0 < x_1 ) because ( x_1 = x_0(2 - ax_0) ) and ( 2 - ax_0 > 0 ) for ( x_0 < frac{2}{a} ).     - We need to show that ( x_1 leq frac{1}{a} ). Since ( x_1 = x_0(2 - ax_0) ), we have:       [       x_1 = x_0(2 - ax_0) leq frac{1}{a}       ]       This simplifies to:       [       x_0(2 - ax_0) leq frac{1}{a}       ]       [       2x_0 - a x_0^2 leq frac{1}{a}       ]       [       a x_0^2 - 2x_0 + frac{1}{a} geq 0       ]       This is a quadratic inequality in ( x_0 ). Solving the quadratic equation ( a x_0^2 - 2x_0 + frac{1}{a} = 0 ) gives the roots:       [       x_0 = frac{2 pm sqrt{4 - 4}}{2a} = frac{1}{a}       ]       Since ( 0 < x_0 < frac{2}{a} ), the inequality holds.5. Inductive Step:   - By induction, assume ( 0 < x_n leq frac{1}{a} ) for some ( n geq 1 ). Then:     [     x_{n+1} = x_n(2 - ax_n)     ]     Since ( 0 < x_n leq frac{1}{a} ), we have ( 2 - ax_n geq 1 ). Thus:     [     x_{n+1} geq x_n     ]     This shows that the sequence ( {x_k} ) is increasing and bounded above by ( frac{1}{a} ).6. Monotonicity and Boundedness:   - The function ( f(x) = x(2 - ax) ) is increasing on the interval ( left(0, frac{1}{a}right] ). Therefore, the sequence ( {x_k} ) is monotonic and bounded, implying it converges to the unique fixed point of ( f(x) ) in this interval, which is ( frac{1}{a} ).7. Conversely:   - If ( x_0 leq 0 ) or ( x_0 geq frac{2}{a} ):     - If ( x_0 = 0 ) or ( x_0 = frac{2}{a} ), then ( x_n = 0 ) for all ( n geq 1 ).     - If ( x_0 > frac{2}{a} ), then ( x_1 < 0 ). By induction, ( x_n ) will be negative and decreasing, diverging to negative infinity.The final answer is ( boxed{ 0 < x_0 < frac{2}{a} } )"},{"problem":"1.

Now, grouping the first 10000 numbers into groups of 77 consecutive numbers, this reasoning applies to each of the lines below, that is, in each line 60 numbers remained.begin{array}{ccccc}text { 1st line: } & 1, & 2, & ldots, & 77 2^{text {nd }} text { line: } & 78, & 79, & ldots, & 154 3^{text {rd }} text { line: } & 155, & 158, & ldots, & 231end{array}Since 2008=33 times 60+28, we know that among the first 33 times 77=2541 numbers, 33 times 60=1980 numbers remained without being erased.text { 33rd line: } quad ldots, quad ldots, quad ldots, quad 2541We still need to count 28 numbers. Let's then examine the 34th line, which starts with 2542. Since the erased numbers are in columns 7,11,14,21,22,28,33,35, etc., and up to the 35^{text {th }} column, eight numbers have been erased, there remain 35-8=27 numbers in the 34^{text {th }} line. Therefore, after erasing the multiples of 7 and 11 in this line, the 28th number is 2577.

Select all its one-element subsets, as well as the sets of the form {1,2, ldots, n}, where n=2,3, ldots, 100. The 199 subsets thus selected satisfy the conditions of the problem. We will show that it is not possible to select 200 subsets that satisfy the conditions of the problem, so the answer to the problem is 199.In general, we will show that from an n-element set, at most 2n-1 subsets can be selected that meet the conditions of the problem. We prove this by induction, for n=1 this is clearly true. Now suppose that the statement is true for all natural numbers less than n, and select as many subsets as possible from an n-element set H such that the subsets satisfy the conditions. It is obvious that H will be among the selected ones, since if it were not, we could add it, as every selected subset is a subset of H. We will prove that at most 2n-2 proper subsets can appear. Let A be one of the largest among the selected proper subsets, and denote the number of elements in A by a. According to the condition, every other subset is either a subset of A, or contains A, or is disjoint from it. But a proper subset containing A cannot exist, since the number of elements in A was maximal. Therefore, among the other selected subsets, there are two types: those that are subsets of A, and those that are disjoint from it.Those that are subsets of A, together with A, form a subsystem of A that satisfies the conditions of the problem. The number of elements in A is less than n, so by the induction hypothesis, there can be at most 2a-1 sets in such a subsystem. The subsets that are disjoint from A also satisfy the conditions of the problem, and are all subsets of the complement of A, H-A, which has n-a geq 1 elements, since A is not empty. Thus, from (H-A), by the induction hypothesis, at most 2(n-a)-1 subsets can be selected that meet the requirements of the problem. We have found that there can be at most 2a-1 subsets that are subsets of A, and at most 2(n-a)-1 that are disjoint from A. Together with H, therefore, we can select at most 1+(2a-1)+2(n-a)-1=2n-1 proper subsets, as we claimed.This proves that from an n-element set, at most 2n-1 non-empty subsets can be selected that meet the requirements of the problem.Remarks. 1. The example given at the beginning of the solution can obviously be generalized: from an n-element set, 2n-1 subsets can always be selected that meet the requirements of the problem.2. By thinking through the proof, we can generally specify all 2n-1-element subsystems of subsets that satisfy the requirements of the problem: we select the entire set, and at each step, we arbitrarily divide a selected but not yet \\"cut\\" set into two parts, and select both of the resulting subsets. We continue this process until every \\"uncut\\" set becomes a one-element set. This way, as can be easily seen, we get 2n-1 subsets, which is good, and we cannot get 2n-1 good subsets any other way.3. During the proof, we \\"helped ourselves\\" twice with a general idea. First, we used complete induction, and second, we cleverly chose the set A: we said it should be the largest possible. With this, we made the system of sets more comprehensible to us. Both ideas are often useful in solving combinatorial problems."},{"problem":"Given vectors overrightarrow{a}=(1,2), overrightarrow{b}=(-1,-1), if overrightarrow{a}- overrightarrow{b} is perpendicular to m overrightarrow{a}+ overrightarrow{b}, then the value of m is ______.","solution":"According to the problem, vectors overrightarrow{a}=(1,2), overrightarrow{b}=(-1,-1),  then overrightarrow{a}- overrightarrow{b}=(2,3), m overrightarrow{a}+ overrightarrow{b}=(m-1,2m-1),  If overrightarrow{a}- overrightarrow{b} is perpendicular to m overrightarrow{a}+ overrightarrow{b}, then ( overrightarrow{a}- overrightarrow{b})cdot(m overrightarrow{a}+ overrightarrow{b})=2(m-1)+3(2m-1)=8m-5=0,  Solving this, we get m= dfrac {5}{8};  Therefore, the answer is: boxed{dfrac {5}{8}}.

It is urgently necessary to restore the decimal representation of (1) the IP address, (2) the subnet mask, and (3) the network address with the appropriate punctuation for manual transmission of these values to the extraction complex.IP address: 10110010101100001110011010101010Subnet mask: 11111111111111111111111110000000","solution":"To convert an IP address and subnet mask from binary to decimal, each of them needs to be divided into octets — combinations of 8 numbers separated by dots.

The number 4 is chosen because it is (frac{-4}{2})^{2}, which makes the left side a perfect square:[x^{2}-4x+4 = 3+4]4. This simplifies to:[left(x-2right)^{2} = 7]5. Taking the square root of both sides gives us:[x-2 = pm sqrt{7}]6.

Then for each variant of the sequence with two closed digits (let their quantity be k_{1}), the magician can restore the original; hence, to each sequence with two closed digits, the magician can uniquely correspond the restored sequence of N digits (let their quantity be k_{2}).

Solution Let A be a subset other than {1, 2, ... , p} and {p+1, p+2, ... , 2p}. Consider the elements of A in {1, 2, ... , p}. The number r satisfies 0 < r < p. We can change these elements to another set of r elements of {1, 2, ... , p} by adding 1 to each element (and reducing mod p if necessary). We can repeat this process and get p sets in all. For example, if p = 7 and the original subset of {1, 2, ... , 7} was {3 , 5}, we get: {3 , 5}, {4, 6}, {5, 7}, {6, 1}, {7, 2}, {1, 3}, {2, 4}. The sum of the elements in the set is increased by r each time. So, since p is prime, the sums must form a complete set of residues mod p. In particular, they must all be distinct and hence all the subsets must be different. Now consider the sets A which have a given intersection with {p+1, ... , n}. Suppose the elements in this intersection sum to k mod p. The sets can be partitioned into groups of p by the process described above, so that exactly one member of each group will have the sum -k mod p for its elements in {1, 2, ... , p}. In other words, exactly one member of each group will have the sum of all its elements divisible by p. There are 2pCp subsets of {1, 2, ... , 2p} of size p. Excluding {1, 2, ... , p} and {p+1, ... , 2p} leaves (2pCp - 2). We have just shown that (2pCp - 2)/p of these have sum divisible by p.

Suppose the athletes start from the same point but in opposite directions.

Therefore, 40 v_{1}-40 v_{2}=1.We have obtained a system of two linear equations with unknowns v_{1}, v_{2}:begin{aligned}& 10 v_{1}+10 v_{2}=1 & 40 v_{1}-40 v_{2}=1end{aligned}We can solve this system, for example, by adding the second equation to four times the first equation, which gives 80 v_{1}=5 or v_{1}=frac{1}{16}. We are interested in how long it takes the faster runner to complete one lap, i.e., the value of the ratio 1 / v_{1}. By substituting the calculated value of v_{1}, we get the answer: 16 minutes.Note. The problem can also be solved by reasoning: in 40 minutes, the athletes together run 4 laps (which follows from the first condition), while the faster one runs 1 lap more than the slower one (which follows from the second condition). This means that the first one runs 2.5 laps and the second one 1.5 laps in the given time, so the faster one completes one lap in 40/2.5, or 16 minutes.For a complete solution, award 6 points, with 2 points for each equation and 2 points for calculating the required value."},{"problem":"Task A-1.4.

Then O lies on the perpendicular ell to left(B C B_{1}right) passing through Q. On the other hand, O lies in the plane alpha passing through N perpendicular to A A_{1} - that is, parallel to ( A B C ). Note that Q lies in alpha, since X Q: Q B_{1}=1: 2=A N: N A_{1}. But Q also lies on ell. If the plane left(B C C_{1} B_{1}right) were perpendicular to the plane (A B C), then all three lateral faces would be perpendicular to the base, which is impossible in a truncated pyramid. Therefore, alpha and ell intersect at exactly one point - the point Q.

Suppose thatx neq a_{1} ; quad x neq a_{2} ; quad ldots ; quad x neq a_{n} ; quad n(x) neq 0thus the denominators of the fractions in the definition of s(x), n(x), and f(x) are different from 0. (This assumption, together with x=a_{1}+a_{2}+ldots+a_{n}, means that the denominators of the fractions in (1) are different from 0.) First, write the functiong(x)=x cdot n(x)-s(x)in a simpler form; in the difference on the right side, combine the fractions with the same denominator, we getbegin{aligned}g(x) & =frac{left(a_{1}-a_{2}right)left(x-a_{1}right)}{x-a_{1}}+frac{left(a_{2}-a_{3}right)left(x-a_{2}right)}{x-a_{2}}+ldots+frac{left(a_{n}-a_{1}right)left(x-a_{n}right)}{x-a_{n}}= & =left(a_{1}-a_{2}right)+left(a_{2}-a_{3}right)+ldots+left(a_{n}-a_{1}right)=0end{aligned}under the conditions that ensure the definition of s(x), n(x), f(x), thus x cdot n(x)-s(x)=0, i.e., f(x)=frac{s(x)}{n(x)}=x. This does not mean that the function f(x) is identical to the function f_{0}(x)=x, since the domain of definition of f(x) and f_{0}(x) is not the same. In our statement, we only said that where f(x) is defined, it is equal to f_{0}(x).Therefore, the value of the expression in the problem - if the denominators are different from 0 - is equal to left(a_{1}+a_{2}+ldots+a_{n}right). (If n=1, then x neq a_{1}, so our expression is not defined.)"},{"problem":"For the odd function f(x) defined on mathbb{R}, satisfying f(x+3)=f(x), if f(-1)=1, then the value of f(1)+f(2)+ldots+f(10) is ______.","solution":"Since f(x) is an odd function, we have f(-x)=-f(x).  Therefore, f(1)=-f(-1)=-1.  f(2)=f((-1)+3)=f(-1)=1.  Since f(0)=f(3)=-f(-3)=-f(-3+3)=-f(0),  we get f(0)=0.  And f(10)=f(7)=f(4)=f(1).  f(9)=f(6)=f(3)=f(0).  f(8)=f(5)=f(2).  Therefore, f(1)+f(2)+ldots+f(10)  =4f(1)+3f(2)+3f(0)  =-4+3=-1.  Hence, the answer is boxed{-1}.  By first determining f(1) based on the function being odd, and then using the property that f(x+3)=f(x) to recognize the function as periodic, we can use the periodicity and the odd nature of the function to find the required result.

Using the first equation:2(24) + 2y = 7248 + 2y = 72Subtracting 48 from both sides gives:2y = 24Dividing both sides by 2 gives:y = 12Therefore, the mass of one No. 5 battery is 24 grams, and the mass of one No. 7 battery is 12 grams. The question asks for the mass of one No. 5 battery obtained by elimination, which we found to be 24 grams.So, the correct answer is boxed{C}."},{"problem":"Given that the odd function f(x) defined on mathbb{R} satisfies f(x) + f(x+2) = 0, and f(1) = -2, find the value of f(5) + f(2).","solution":"According to the problem, the function f(x) satisfies f(x) + f(x+2) = 0, which implies f(x+2) = -f(x).Then, we have f(x+4) = -f(x+2) = f(x), indicating that function f(x) is a periodic function with a period of 4. Therefore, f(2) = f(-2).Since function f(x) is an odd function, we have f(-2) = -f(2), which leads to f(2) = f(-2) = 0.Also, we have f(5) = f(1) = -2.Hence, f(5) + f(2) = -2.So, the answer is: boxed{-2}From the problem, we can derive that f(x+4) = -f(x+2) = f(x), meaning that function f(x) is a periodic function with a period of 4.

Furthermore, f(5) = f(1) = -2, and adding these two values together will yield the answer.This problem tests the comprehensive application of a function's odd-even property and periodicity.

Let angle B A C=alpha and angle A C B=gamma. Triangles A O T and B O T are congruent by three sides, and the inscribed angle angle A C B subtends the same arc as the central angle angle A O B, so gamma=angle A C B=frac{1}{2} angle A O B=angle T O B. Therefore, frac{O B}{O T}=cos gamma. Similarly, angle B O C=2 angle B A C and from the isosceles property of triangle B O C, it follows that angle B C O=90^{circ}-frac{1}{2} angle B O C=90^{circ}-angle B A C. Since angle A B_{1} B=90^{circ}=angle A A_{1} B, quadrilateral A B_{1} A_{1} B is cyclic. Therefore, angle B A C=angle C A_{1} B_{1}. Thus, angle B C O=90^{circ}-angle B A C=90^{circ}-angle C A_{1} B_{1} and lines A_{1} B_{1} and C O are perpendicular. Therefore, lines C O and T K are parallel, and quadrilateral C O T K is a parallelogram, in particular, C K=O T. Then, by Thales' theorem, frac{C L}{C C_{1}}=frac{C O}{C K}=frac{O B}{O T}=cos gamma.

As k increases, p, and thus N, also increases, so our task is to determine the smallest integer k for which p=5k+1 and q=4k+1 are both prime numbers.Since N is non-negative, p and q are also non-negative, and since they are primes, they are greater than 1, so k geq 1. k must be even, because otherwise 5k+1 would be an even composite number. k must also be divisible by 3, because if it left a remainder of 1, then 5k+1 would be divisible by 3 and greater than 3, thus composite, and if it left a remainder of 2, then 4k+1. Therefore, k is divisible by 2 and 3, hence by 6: k=6n, p=30n+1, and q=24n+1, and our task is to find the smallest positive integer n for which both p and q are prime.By trying the first few values, we have listed in the table below the prime factorization of each composite value:begin{aligned}& n=1 quad text{in which case} quad 24n+1=5^{2} & n=2 quad text{in which case} quad 24n+1=7^{2} & n=3 quad text{in which case} quad 30n+1=7 cdot 13 & n=4 quad text{in which case} quad 30n+1=11^{2}, & n=5 quad text{in which case} quad 24n+1=11^{2} & n=6 quad text{in which case} quad 24n+1=5 cdot 29, & n=7 quad text{in which case} quad 24n+1=13^{2} & n=8 quad text{in which case} quad 30n+1=241, quad 24n+1=193 text{. }end{aligned}It is easy to verify that 241 and 193 are both prime.

Call the vertex where the sides of length 20 and 17 meet alpha, denote the vertex where 17 doesn't meet 20 by beta, and the final vertex, which meets 20 but not 17 , we denote by gamma.The law of cosines states that if we have a triangle, then we have the equation c^{2}=a^{2}+b^{2}-2 a b cos C where C is the angle between a and b.

We then try satisfying this equation for the 3 possible vertices and find that, for alpha the equation reads c^{2}=400+289-340=349 so that c=sqrt{349}. For beta we find that 400=289+b^{2}-17 b or rather b^{2}-17 b-111=0 this is a quadratic, solving we find that it has two roots b=frac{17 pm sqrt{289+444}}{2}, but since sqrt{733}>17 only one of these roots is positive.

Thus, the distance between the foci (denoted as c) can be calculated as c^{2} = a^{2} - b^{2} = 36 - 24 = 12, which gives c = 2sqrt{3}. Therefore, the coordinates of the foci are F_{1}(-2sqrt{3}, 0) and F_{2}(2sqrt{3}, 0).Next, we rewrite the hyperbola equation x^{2}-y^{2}=m as frac{x^{2}}{m} - frac{y^{2}}{m} = 1.

This behavior is determined by the sign of the numerator k-2 because the denominator x changes sign depending on the quadrant. To ensure that y is positive when x is negative and negative when x is positive, the numerator k-2 must be negative.

(Therefore, m_{c} > varrho.)The construction process is as follows: We draw a ray from point C, on which we measure the distances CT = s - c and CT_{c} = s. On the perpendicular to CT at T, we measure the constructed segment varrho = TO. The intersection of the perpendicular to CT at T_{c} and the line CO is O_{c}. Drawing the incircle and the excircle around O and O_{c}, respectively, the other common external tangent of these two circles will be the line carrying side CA, and one of the common internal tangents will be the line carrying side BA. (The other common internal tangent leads to the symmetric solution with respect to the CO axis.)The solvability condition (besides d > c) is that the two constructed tangent circles do not intersect at two different points, because in the latter case there is no common internal tangent.

The intersection of a line and an ellipse can be constructed most simply by transferring the line to a circle system that is affinely related to the ellipse, and then transferring the constructed intersection points back to the ellipse system.In this case, the most convenient is to consider the circle k' drawn over the minor axis as the affine counterpart of the ellipse. In this case, the minor axis is the x-axis of the affinity, the direction of the affinity is perpendicular to it, the point P at the end of the major axis corresponds to the point P' on the circle, and thus the affine counterpart of e is e', which coincides with e.

Thus, t_{max }=frac{720}{11}=65 . overline{45} seconds.Finding the value of t_{min }Recall that t_{min } is the time it takes the second jogger to complete one lap when the first jogger completes one lap of the track in 100 seconds.If the first jogger can complete one lap of the track in 100 seconds, then in 36 seconds of running, the first jogger will complete frac{36}{100}=frac{9}{25} of a complete lap of the track.In this same 36 seconds, the two joggers combined distance running is 1 lap, and so the second jogger runs 1-frac{9}{25}=frac{16}{25} of a complete lap.If the second jogger runs frac{16}{25} of a complete lap in 36 seconds, then the second jogger runs frac{25}{16} times frac{16}{25}=1 complete lap in frac{25}{16} times 36=frac{900}{16} seconds.

Given the conditions:   [   2sum_{i=1}^{39} sin(x_i) = -34 quad text{and} quad sum_{i=1}^{39} cos(x_i) = -34,   ]   we can rewrite these as:   [   sum_{i=1}^{39} sin(x_i) = -17 quad text{and} quad sum_{i=1}^{39} cos(x_i) = -34.   ]   This implies that the sum of all vectors ( vec{v_i} ) is ( (-34, -17) ), which we will call point ( Q ).2. Geometric Interpretation:   We need to find the maximum values of ( cos(x_1) ) and ( sin(x_1) ) over all tuples ( (x_1, x_2, ldots, x_{39}) ) satisfying the given conditions. To do this, we consider a point ( P ) on the unit circle where ( vec{v_1} = vec{OP} ), and we need to maximize the ( x )-coordinate (for ( cos(x_1) )) and the ( y )-coordinate (for ( sin(x_1) )) of ( P ).3. Distance Calculation:   The distance ( PQ ) must be less than or equal to 38 because the sum of the magnitudes of the remaining 38 vectors must be 38 (since each vector has a unit magnitude). Therefore, we set ( PQ = 38 ) exactly to maximize the coordinates.4. Intersection Points:   We look at the intersections of the circle with radius 38 centered at ( Q ) with the unit circle. These intersections will give us the maximum possible values for ( cos(x_1) ) and ( sin(x_1) ).5. Trigonometric Calculations:   We need to find the coordinates of these intersection points.

Maximizing ( cos(x_1) ) and ( sin(x_1) ):   Using the trigonometric addition formulas, we find the ( x )-coordinate of ( X ) (the point with the maximum ( cos(x_1) )) and the ( y )-coordinate of ( Y ) (the point with the maximum ( sin(x_1) )):   [   cos(x_1) = frac{38}{17sqrt{5}} cdot frac{1}{sqrt{5}} - frac{1}{17sqrt{5}} cdot frac{2}{sqrt{5}} = frac{36}{85},   ]   and   [   sin(x_1) = frac{38}{17sqrt{5}} cdot frac{2}{sqrt{5}} - frac{1}{17sqrt{5}} cdot frac{1}{sqrt{5}} = frac{15}{17}.   ]7. Ratio Calculation:   The ratio between the maximum of ( cos(x_1) ) and the maximum of ( sin(x_1) ) is:   [   frac{frac{36}{85}}{frac{15}{17}} = frac{36}{85} cdot frac{17}{15} = frac{36 cdot 17}{85 cdot 15} = frac{612}{1275} = frac{12}{25}.   ]8.

Given triangle ABC with angle A = 23^circ and angle B = 46^circ, we need to find angle MAN where M and N are the points where the external angle bisector of angle B intersects the circle Gamma centered at C with radius AC.2. First, we calculate angle C:   [   angle C = 180^circ - angle A - angle B = 180^circ - 23^circ - 46^circ = 111^circ   ]3. Let C_{perp} be the projection of C on the internal angle bisector of angle B. Let C' be the projection of C on MN. Since CC_{perp}BC' forms a rectangle (because the internal bisector is perpendicular to the external bisector), we have:   [   CC' = BC_{perp} = BC cos(23^circ)   ]4. By the Pythagorean theorem, we have:   [   2R sin(angle MAN) = MN = 2MC' = 2sqrt{AC^2 - BC^2 cos^2(23^circ)}   ]5. Simplifying, we get:   [   cos^2(angle MAN) = frac{BC^2}{AC^2} cdot cos^2(23^circ)   ]6. Using the Law of Sines (LOS), we find:   [   frac{BC}{AC} = frac{sin(23^circ)}{sin(46^circ)} = frac{1}{2 cos(23^circ)}   ]7. Substituting this into our previous equation, we get:   [   cos^2(angle MAN) = left(frac{1}{2 cos(23^circ)}right)^2 cdot cos^2(23^circ) = frac{1}{4}   ]8. Since cos^2(angle MAN) = frac{1}{4}, we have:   [   cos(angle MAN) = frac{1}{2}   ]9. Therefore, angle MAN = 60^circ or angle MAN = 120^circ.

We need to prove the inequality ( a^3 + b^3 + c^3 < (a + b + c)(ab + bc + ca) ) for ( k = 1 ).2. Since ( a, b, c ) are the sides of a triangle, we can use the identity ( a^3 + b^3 + c^3 - 3abc = (a + b + c)(a^2 + b^2 + c^2 - ab - bc - ca) ).3. Therefore, we can rewrite the inequality as:   [   a^3 + b^3 + c^3 < (a + b + c)(ab + bc + ca)   ]   which is equivalent to:   [   a^3 + b^3 + c^3 - 3abc < (a + b + c)(ab + bc + ca) - 3abc   ]4. Using the identity, we have:   [   (a + b + c)(a^2 + b^2 + c^2 - ab - bc - ca) < (a + b + c)(ab + bc + ca) - 3abc   ]5. Simplifying, we get:   [   a^2 + b^2 + c^2 - ab - bc - ca < ab + bc + ca   ]6.

Also:   [   (a + b + c)(ab + bc + ca) = 2(x + y + z)(xy + yz + zx + x^2 + y^2 + z^2)   ]6. Simplifying, we get:   [   (a + b + c)(ab + bc + ca) = 2(x + y + z)(xy + yz + zx + x^2 + y^2 + z^2)   ]7.

Claim: The minimum number of bad lamps on a (2017 times 2017) board is 1. This is true for any (n times n) board when (n) is odd.2. Proof:    - Existence of a configuration with 1 bad lamp:        - Consider placing a bad lamp in the center of the board and working outward in rings. This configuration ensures that only the center lamp is bad, and all other lamps have an odd number of neighbors that are on. This is a non-trivial configuration but can be constructed.    - Non-existence of a configuration with 0 bad lamps:        - Assume there exists a configuration with 0 bad lamps.        - Using chess notation, consider the cells (a1), (a2), and (b1):            - If both (a2) and (b1) are off, (a1) is bad.            - If both (a2) and (b1) are on, (a1) is bad.            - Therefore, exactly one of (a2) and (b1) must be on.        - Similarly, consider the cells (b2), (b3), and (c2):            - If both (b3) and (c2) are off, (b2) is bad.            - If both (b3) and (c2) are on, (b2) is bad.            - Therefore, exactly one of (b3) and (c2) must be on.        - Continue this process along the diagonal to the center of the board. After 1008 steps, we find that the cells left and below the center cell must both be on or both be off to avoid making the cell diagonally to the left bottom of the center cell bad.        - By symmetry, starting from the other three corners along their respective diagonals, we find that all four cells neighboring the center must be of the same parity (either all on or all off).        - However, this makes the center cell bad, as it will have an even number of neighbors that are on.        - This contradicts the assumption that there are 0 bad lamps.3. Conclusion:    - Therefore, the smallest possible number of bad lamps on a (2017 times 2017) board is 1.The final answer is (boxed{1})"},{"problem":"3.20.

Understanding the Problem:   We need to cover an ( n times n ) board using figures ( L_{m_1}, L_{m_2}, dots, L_{m_k} ). Each ( L_m ) is formed by overlapping a ( 1 times m ) and an ( m times 1 ) rectangle at a ( 1 times 1 ) square. The goal is to find the minimal possible value of ( m_1 + m_2 + dots + m_k ).2. Initial Observation:   Each ( L_m ) covers ( 2m - 1 ) cells on the board. This is because the ( 1 times m ) and ( m times 1 ) rectangles overlap at one cell, so the total number of unique cells covered is ( m + m - 1 = 2m - 1 ).3. Counting the Total Coverage:   To cover the entire ( n times n ) board, we need to ensure that the sum of the areas covered by the ( L )-shaped figures is at least ( n^2 ). Therefore, we need:   [   (2m_1 - 1) + (2m_2 - 1) + dots + (2m_k - 1) geq n^2   ]4. Simplifying the Inequality:   Simplifying the left-hand side, we get:   [   2(m_1 + m_2 + dots + m_k) - k geq n^2   ]   Rearranging this inequality, we obtain:   [   2(m_1 + m_2 + dots + m_k) geq n^2 + k   ]5. Minimizing ( m_1 + m_2 + dots + m_k ):   To minimize ( m_1 + m_2 + dots + m_k ), we need to consider the smallest possible value of ( k ). The minimum number of ( L )-shaped figures required to cover the board is ( n ), because each ( L )-shaped figure can cover at most ( 2m - 1 ) cells, and we need to cover ( n^2 ) cells.6. Substituting ( k = n ):   Substituting ( k = n ) into the inequality, we get:   [   2(m_1 + m_2 + dots + m_k) geq n^2 + n   ]   Dividing both sides by 2, we obtain:   [   m_1 + m_2 + dots + m_k geq frac{n^2 + n}{2}   ]7.

For a function to be even, its graph must be symmetric about the y-axis. This implies that the function's definition domain, if centered around the origin, should result in the function being unchanged when x is replaced with -x. However, since our domain is [a-2, a], we adjust our approach to consider the symmetry of the domain itself. The midpoint of the interval [a-2, a] is frac{(a-2)+a}{2} = a-1. For the function to be even within this interval, the midpoint of the interval should ideally be 0 (as for a standard even function). Therefore, we set a-1 = 0 to align with the symmetry requirement of an even function, which leads to:   a-1 = 0 implies a = 12. Next, considering the property of an even function that its graph is symmetric about the y-axis, we look at the coefficient of the x term, which is (b-3). For the function to be even, the term involving x must either be absent or ensure that the function remains unchanged under x rightarrow -x. This leads to the condition that the coefficient of x must be 0 because an even function cannot have an odd power term with a non-zero coefficient.

Modulo 9 property: The sum of the digits of a number (x) in the decimal system is congruent to (x mod 9). This is a well-known property of numbers in base 10.

Define Indicator Variables:   Let ( X_i ) be an indicator variable that is 1 if the ( i )-th urn has exactly one marble, and 0 otherwise. The total number of urns with exactly one marble is given by:   [   X = sum_{i=1}^{7} X_i   ]2. Linearity of Expectation:   By the linearity of expectation, we have:   [   mathbb{E}[X] = mathbb{E}left[sum_{i=1}^{7} X_iright] = sum_{i=1}^{7} mathbb{E}[X_i]   ]3. Calculate (mathbb{E}[X_i]):   We need to find the probability that a specific urn (say the ( i )-th urn) has exactly one marble.

Here, (binom{5}{1}) represents choosing 1 out of 5 marbles to place in the ( i )-th urn, and ( 6^4 ) represents distributing the remaining 4 marbles into the other 6 urns.   Therefore, the probability that the ( i )-th urn has exactly one marble is:   [   mathbb{P}(X_i = 1) = frac{binom{5}{1} cdot 6^4}{7^5}   ]4.

On one side and the other of this diagonal, there are respectively k-2 vertices of the n-gon (vertices A_{2}, A_{3}, A_{4}, ldots, A_{k-1}) and n-k vertices (vertices A_{k+1}, A_{k+2}, ldots, A_{n}). The diagonal A_{1} A_{k} will intersect with all diagonals connecting any of the k-2 vertices of the first group with any of the n-k vertices of the second group, i.e., with (k-2)(n-k) diagonals. Therefore, all diagonals emanating from vertex A_{1} (diagonals A_{1} A_{3}, A_{1} A_{4}, ldots, A_{1} A_{n-1}) will intersect with other diagonals at1 cdot(n-3)+2(n-4)+3(n-5)+ldots+(n-3) cdot 1points.

The diagonals emanating from any other vertex of the n-gon will intersect with other diagonals at the same number of points. However, multiplying frac{(n-1)(n-2)(n-3)}{6} by the number of vertices of the n-gon (which is n), we will count each intersection point exactly four times (in each of these points, exactly two diagonals intersect, each of which has two[^13]see the footnote on page 179.Similarly1 cdot 2 cdot 3+2 cdot 3 cdot 4+3 cdot 4 cdot 5+ldots+n(n+1)(n+2)==1(1+1)(2+2)+2(2+1)(2+2)+ldots+n(n+1)(n+2)= =left(1^{3}+2^{3}+ldots+n^{3}right)+3left(1^{2}+2^{2}+ldots+n^{2}right)+2(1+2+ldots+n) ; see the footnote on page 179 and 188.ends in two vertices). The final number of intersection points isfrac{(n-1)(n-2)(n-3)}{6} cdot frac{n}{4}=frac{n(n-1)(n-2)(n-3)}{24}Second solution. This problem can be solved much more simply if we know the formula for combinations. Indeed, consider any intersection point of diagonals. Each intersection point belongs to two diagonals. The point B of intersection of diagonals A_{1} A_{3} and A_{2} A_{1} corresponds to a quadruple of vertices A_{1}, A_{2}, A_{3}, and A_{4} of our n-gon (point B is the intersection point of the diagonals of the quadrilateral A_{1} A_{2} A_{3} A_{4}, see Fig. 58). Conversely, each quadruple of vertices A_{1}, A_{2}, A_{3}, and A_{4} of the n-gon corresponds to a unique intersection point of diagonals whose endpoints are these four vertices, namely, the intersection point of the diagonals of the quadrilateral A_{1} A_{2} A_{3} A_{4}. Therefore, the number of intersection points of diagonals of a convex n-gon is equal to the number of combinations of n elements taken 4 at a time, i.e., it is equal toC_{n}^{4}=frac{n(n-1)(n-2)(n-3)}{24}"},{"problem":"Given the parabola y^{2}=2pxleft(p gt 0right) with focus F, the line y=4 intersects the parabola at point M, and |MF|=4, find p.","solution":"To solve the problem, we follow these steps:1.

According to the definition of a parabola, the distance from any point on the parabola to the focus F is equal to the distance from that point to the directrix. Given that |MF|=4, we can use the formula for the distance from a point to the focus of a parabola y^2 = 2px (where the focus is at (frac{p}{2}, 0)) to set up the equation:[|MF| = frac{p}{2} + frac{8}{p} = 4]3.

To ensure the existence of x_{1} and x_{2} such that x_{1}+x_{2} leqslant frac{pi}{2}, a sufficient condition is n geqslant 4. Thus, when n geqslant 4, we can use the following smoothing tool. Lemma: If 0 leqslant x_{1}, x_{2} leqslant frac{pi}{2}, and x_{1}+x_{2} leqslant frac{pi}{2}, then sin ^{2} x_{1}+sin ^{2} x_{2} leqslant sin ^{2}left(x_{1}+x_{2}right). In fact, from 0 leqslant x_{1}, x_{2} leqslant frac{pi}{2} and x_{1}+x_{2} leqslant frac{pi}{2}, we know that left|x_{1}-x_{2}right| leqslantleft|x_{1}+x_{2}right| leqslant frac{pi}{2}. Therefore, cos left(x_{1}-x_{2}right) geqslant cos left(x_{1}+x_{2}right), so 2-2left(sin ^{2} x_{1}+sin ^{2} x_{2}right)=cos 2 x_{1}+cos 2 x_{2}=2 cos left(x_{1}+x_{2}right) cos left(x_{1}-x_{2}right) geqslant 2 cos left(x_{1}+x_{2}right) cos left(x_{1}+x_{2}right)=2 cos ^{2}left(x_{1}+x_{2}right)=2left[1-sin ^{2}left(x_{1}+x_{2}right)right]= 2-2 sin ^{2}left(x_{1}+x_{2}right), rearranging, the lemma is proved. We now discuss the cases. When n=3, if the three angles are left(frac{pi}{2}, frac{pi}{2}, 0right), then adjusting to left(frac{pi}{2}, frac{pi}{4}, frac{pi}{4}right), the value of F increases from 2 to 1+sqrt{2}, so we can assume x_{1} leqslant x_{2} leqslant x_{3}, and left(x_{1}, x_{2}, x_{3}right) neqleft(0, frac{pi}{2}, frac{pi}{2}right). Then x_{2}>frac{pi}{2}, x_{1} leqslant frac{pi}{3} leqslant x_{3}. Smoothing left(x_{1}, x_{2}, x_{3}right) to left(frac{pi}{3}, x_{2}, x_{1}+x_{3}-frac{pi}{3}right), by the above discussion, F increases. Another smoothing transformation yields left(frac{pi}{3}, frac{pi}{3}, frac{pi}{3}right), so F leqslant frac{9}{4}. When n geqslant 4, assume x_{1} geqslant x_{2} geqslant cdots geqslant x_{n-1} geqslant x_{n}, then there must be two angles: x_{n-1}+x_{n} leqslant frac{pi}{2}. By the lemma, F=sin ^{2} x_{1}+cdots+sin ^{2} x_{n-1}+sin ^{2} x_{n} geqslant sin ^{2} x_{1}+sin ^{2} x_{2}+cdots+sin ^{2}left(x_{n-1}+x_{n}right)= sin ^{2} x_{1}^{prime}+cdots+sin ^{2} x_{n-2}^{prime}+sin ^{2} x_{n-1}^{prime} (where x_{1}^{prime}, x_{2}^{prime}, cdots, x_{n-2}^{prime}, x_{n-1}^{prime} are x_{1}, x_{2}, cdots, x_{n-2}, x_{n-1}+x_{n} in descending order). If n-1 geqslant 4, then there must be two angles: x_{n-2}^{prime}+x_{n-1}^{prime} leqslant frac{pi}{2}. Continue using the lemma for the above transformation, at most n-3 times, the variable set can be transformed into left(x_{1}^{prime}, x_{2}^{prime}, x_{3}^{prime}, 0,0, cdots, 0right). Using the result when n=3, we know that F leqslant frac{9}{4}, the equality holds when x_{1}=x_{2}=x_{3}=frac{pi}{3}, x_{4}=x_{5}=cdots=x_{n}=0. Therefore, when n=2, the maximum value of F is 2; when n>2, the maximum value of F is frac{9}{4}."},{"problem":"3. In the cells of a 3 times 3 square, the numbers 1,2,3, ldots, 9 are arranged.

All these numbers are prime, and the sheriff has been lucky for five days in a row.We will show that the sheriff cannot be lucky for six days in a row. Note that by Wednesday, this number is no less than 2 cdot 2 + 3 = 7, and it only increases from there. Therefore, it is sufficient to show that on Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, or Saturday, there will be a day when the number of bandits caught is divisible by 3.Assume the opposite, that on all these days, the number of bandits caught is not divisible by 3. In particular, the numbers of bandits caught on Wednesday and Thursday do not divide by 3; let's denote them as A and B respectively. Then the number of bandits caught on Friday is A + 2B. There are two possible situations.1) The remainders of A and B when divided by 3 are the same. Then the number A + 2B = A + B + B is the sum of three numbers with the same remainder when divided by 3, so it is divisible by 3. Contradiction.2) The remainders of A and B when divided by 3 are different: one is 1, the other is 2. Then the number A + B is divisible by 3, so the number A + 2B = (A + B) + B has the same remainder when divided by 3 as the number B. Therefore, the numbers of bandits caught on Thursday and Friday have the same remainder when divided by 3. Reasoning as in point 1, we get that the number of bandits caught on Saturday is divisible by 3. Again, a contradiction.

Indeed, any digit from 0 to 9 can be represented as the sum of some two \\"working\\" digits. Let the number from 1 to 99999999 that we want to obtain consist of digits a_{1}, a_{2}, ldots, a_{8} (some of them, including the leading ones, may be zeros). Represent each of them as the sum of two \\"working\\" digits: a_{1} = b_{1} + c_{1}, a_{2} = b_{2} + c_{2}, ldots, a_{8} = b_{8} + c_{8}. Then the number composed of \\"working\\" digits b_{1}, b_{2}, ldots, b_{8} and the number composed of \\"working\\" digits c_{1}, c_{2}, ldots, c_{8} give the desired number when summed.Suppose that the desired result can be achieved for some set of four \\"working\\" digits. Let a be some odd digit. Among the numbers from 1 to 99999999, there will be one that ends in a and contains \\"non-working\\" digits in its decimal representation. Then this number can be represented as the sum of two numbers, whose representations contain only \\"working\\" digits. Therefore, for each odd digit a, there will be such two \\"working\\" digits (possibly the same) whose sum ends in a. On the other hand, it is not difficult to see that among all the sums of pairs of four \\"working\\" digits, there can be no more than four odd numbers. Therefore, one of the digits 1, 3, 5, 7, 9 will not appear at the end of such sums.

Every time the one who choose number chooses one number from the remaining numbers. When all 82 numbers are chosen, let A be the sum of all the numbers Amy chooses, and let B be the sum of all the numbers Bob chooses. During the process, Amy tries to make gcd(A,B) as great as possible, and Bob tries to make gcd(A,B) as little as possible. Suppose Amy and Bob take the best strategy of each one, respectively, determine gcd(A,B) when all 82 numbers are chosen.","solution":"1. Sum of All Numbers:   The sum of all numbers from (0) to (81) is given by the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series:   [   S = sum_{k=0}^{81} k = frac{81 cdot (81 + 1)}{2} = frac{81 cdot 82}{2} = 81 cdot 41   ]   Therefore, (A + B = 81 cdot 41).2. Applying the Euclidean Algorithm:   Using the Euclidean Algorithm, we have:   [   gcd(A, B) = gcd(A, A + B) = gcd(A, 81 cdot 41)   ]   Since (81 = 3^4), we get:   [   gcd(A, 81 cdot 41) = gcd(A, 3^4 cdot 41)   ]   This implies that (gcd(A, B)) must be a divisor of (3^4 cdot 41).3. Bob's Strategy to Minimize (gcd(A, B)):   Bob aims to make (gcd(A, B)) as small as possible. To achieve this, Bob can ensure that neither (A) nor (B) is divisible by (3).    - Dividing Numbers into Sets:     Divide the numbers into 14 sets:     [     A_1 = {0, 1, 2, 3}, quad A_2 = {4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}, quad dots, quad A_{14} = {76, 77, 78, 79, 80, 81}     ]     Each set (A_i) for (i > 1) contains 6 consecutive numbers.   - Ensuring Non-Divisibility by 3:     For (A_1), if Amy takes a number divisible by 3, Bob takes another number divisible by 3. This ensures that the sums of numbers taken from (A_1) by both Amy and Bob are not divisible by 3.     For (A_i) ((i geq 2)), if Amy takes a number of the form (3k + l), Bob takes another number of the same form. This ensures that the sums of numbers taken from each (A_i) by both Amy and Bob are divisible by 3. Summing these sets ensures that (A) and (B) are not divisible by 3.4. Amy's Strategy to Maximize (gcd(A, B)):   Amy aims to make (gcd(A, B)) as large as possible. To achieve this, Amy can ensure that both (A) and (B) are divisible by 41.   - Ensuring Divisibility by 41:     Write the 82 numbers as two sets of complete residues modulo 41. Amy takes the first number randomly. If Bob takes the same number, Amy takes another random number. This procedure continues until Bob takes a different number from Amy. Then Amy takes the same number Bob took, and this process repeats. This ensures that both Amy and Bob will take each residue exactly once.     [     A equiv B equiv 0 + 1 + 2 + cdots + 40 equiv 41 cdot 20 equiv 0 pmod{41}     ]     Therefore, both (A) and (B) are divisible by 41.5. Conclusion:   Since Bob ensures that (A) and (B) are not divisible by 3, and Amy ensures that both (A) and (B) are divisible by 41, the greatest common divisor of (A) and (B) is 41.(blacksquare)The final answer is ( boxed{ gcd(A, B) = 41 } )."},{"problem":"Given that a > 0 and b > 0 are real numbers, and frac{1}{a+1}+ frac{1}{b+1}=1, find the minimum value of a+2b.","solution":"[Analysis]This problem tests the properties of basic inequalities.

Solution","solution":": α = N - 1, x k = (N-1)C(k-1) for k ≤ N and 0 for k > N. Easy to get the answer, harder to prove it (but straightforward provided you are familiar with generating functions). Playing around with low values of N quickly generates the binomial coefficients and the value α = N - 1. It is then straightforward to verify that these values satisfy the recurrence relation. But that still leaves open the possibility that a larger value of α might work. So we have to use a little more machinery. Notice first that if x N+1 = 0, then x N+2 = 0 and hence x i = 0 for all i > N. Now define the generating function f(z) = ∑ 0 ∞ x k+1 z k . We have no convergence worries, because f(z) is in fact a polynomial. We have f '(z) = ∑ 0 ∞ (k+1)x k+2 z k , zf(z) = ∑ 1 ∞ x k z k , and z 2 f '(z) + zf(z) = ∑ 1 ∞ k x k z k , and so the recurrence relation is equivalent to: f '(z)/f(z) = (α - (N-1)z)/(1 - z 2 ) = (α - (N-1))/(2(1 - z)) + (α + N-1)/(2(1+z)). Integrating (and using x 1 = 0): f(z) = (1-z) (N-1-α)/2 (1+z) (α+N-1)/2 . Now we see immediately that the largest value of α which gives a polynomial is α = N - 1. The generating function is then (1 + z) N-1 , and so x k = (N-1)C(k-1).

Substitute and Simplify:   Let us denote the given functional equation as ( P(m, n) ):   [ P(m, n): f(m + f(n)) = n + f(m + 95) ]2. Initial Substitution:   Substitute ( m = 1 ) into ( P(m, n) ):   [ f(1 + f(n)) = n + f(1 + 95) ]   Let ( c = f(1 + 95) ). Then,   [ f(1 + f(n)) = n + c ]3.

(and thus every N ! with N geq 55 ) contains at least six more factors of 5 than 30 !.Now since N geq 50, then 50 ! is a divisor of N!=30!cdot 5^{5} cdot 2^{4} k.Rearranging, we get N(N-1)(N-2) cdots(33)(32)(31)=5^{5} cdot 2^{4} k or N(N-1)(N-2) cdots(33)(2)(31)= 5^{5} k.Since the left side is even, then k is even.Since k is even and k is not divisible by 10 , then k is not divisible by 5 .
