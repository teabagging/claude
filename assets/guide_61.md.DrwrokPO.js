I can t remember any specific injury that would cause it nor was I particularly active when it started. When sitting still or just walking there is just a mild ache or feeling of discomfort, but nothing bad. When I go to run fast there is significant pain after the foot is taken off the ground for the next step. This pain is generally in the gap below the knee cap. There is also pain when there is any backward force placed on the straightened knee. However the thing that causes the most pain is when I cross the affected leg over the knee of the unaffected leg when sitting. This causes significant pain on the lateral aspect of my knee though rarely it is felt on the medial side as well. I went to see my Family Doctor about this last week and he didn t come to anything conclusive other than to say that it could be a meniscus issue. In his exam he only noted slight swelling in the knee, pain when backward pressure was placed on the knee, and a small bump on the lower lateral side of the knee cap when the knee was fully straightened and quadriceps flexed as opposed to the other knee (which he thought might be bursa inflammation). His recommendation was just to wait and see, however the problem is kinda annoying and I m just wondering if anyone else might have an idea as to what is causing this.","Doctor":"Hello,It could be an arthritis with joint effusion.

I need to know what I can do currently for it and if you know what I may have done to it. Ok so at the beginning of december of 2011 I was ice skating on a school field trip. I fell 3 times and the third and last time I fell it hurt the most. I landed on my wrist and it hurt ALOT. Anyway I hurt it at the base of my hand and the beginning of my wrist. It s close to the end of Jan. now it still hurts as bad as it did when I fell on it. The funny thing is, is that it s not swollen at all or maybe a little bit. (I don t know how to tell if it s swollen or not) It only hurts when I put a little bit of pressure on it. For example my schoolbag is a messenger bag and it gets very very heavy at times and just a little bit of heavy at other times. Anyway I can pick it up a little bit when it s over my shoulder, but I can t carry it, no matter how heavy it is, at all. I tried using ice to see if it would help and it didn t help really. I decided to try the rice treatment and the only thing that helped was the ace bandage. My friends say it might be fractured but if it was it would be swollen and I wouldn t be able to use it right?

I can t go to the doctors for x-rays because my parents are teachers and they are paying for my sisters college right now so they don t really have the money to pay for x-rays, and besides it s been over a month since I fell on my wrist so it s a little late for x-rays right?

I m a nursing assistant, so I do some pretty heavy lifting. I m a 23 year old female. I went in to the clinic at the begining of this month and was diagnosed with tendonitis in my shoulder and a muscle strain. I was prescribed Naproxen, a muscle relaxant, and physical therapy. I went to physical therapy and everything seemed to go okay. I mean, it didn t hurt any more than when I wasn t there. About 4 hours afterwards though, I had worse pain than when I first was seen. I was then seen the next day and the physician ordered an MRI of my cervical spine in search of a herniated disc pinching a nerve. From the first time I was seen until now, my pain has increased, but also I have had numbness, weakness, and pins and needles or tingly feeling in my arm and hand. The MRI came back negative for a herniated disc, so I was told I could return to work with a lifting restriction of 10 lbs and also no pulling, pushing, or reaching my arm above my head. Today was my first day back to work and I was placed in a part of the hospital making phone calls all day to accommodate my lifting restriction. The terrible pain is back in my neck shoulder and arm and has been getting worse for the past few hours. Lidocaine patches helped my pain for a while, but I am wondering about a diagnosis.

Today after 12 days since surgery, I still have muscle pains in the back of my calf and inner thigh and my right leg and foot are a bit swollen. *Is this normal after post-op appendicitis? *Is this because of all that pulling before surgery and now its been released that my tendons/muscle fibers are simply injured and its taking along time to recover? *Or do I have a blood clot which I have seen have similar symptoms?

I don t have any acid reflux issues, and I m not (that I know of) hypoglycemic. I m a 28 year old male, that is relatively fit, but not very active.","Doctor":"If this has happened once only then it should have been because of what you ate last or may be before that. Either hyperacidity or some infection. If it is still happening then you should immediately seek medical attention. Mean while you can take tab ondem mouth desolving tab one stat without water. Wait for few minutes to let it sink in. Then start having sips of water in small quantity. After about half an hour you can have water with electrolyte. Even then you throw up see a doctor as soon as possible because you may require injectables. If vomiting has stopped and stools are normal then no need to worry.  Good luck"},{"Patient":"Yes, I am scheduled to have a hip replacement surgery on 4/9/12, and i am very anxious. I am dredding the surgery, and one reason is the use of a catheter.

As days went by the pain and weakness increased and my back and front upper arm muscles became involved; I have a very hard time combing the back of my hair, washing my back in the shower and lifting things at certain angles. In the beginning, I had to physically pull my legs up to get into my car to go to work because of the pain and weakness; that has now improved and I can step into my car fairly normally now. Next the lymph nodes in my neck became sore and my jaw muscles were sore a bit. I have no fever, but sometimes limited chills. I visited my P/A who sent me for bloodwork. I do not have copies of all of it yet (tomorrow), but she indicated that my antinuclear antibodies were elevated. I do know that my AST/SGOT is 175, ALT/SGPT is 70 and estimated GFR is below 60. She told me that my Lyme tests came back negative, but I understand that sometimes the tests show negative at first in people who do actually have the disease. In fact, three of the volunteers that work with me have had this happen in the past few years. I live in rural Maine with woods on three sides of our yard; this week my adult nephew found 13 ticks (not sure what kind) in our yard. I have not found any ticks on my body, but my deceased dog had many ticks that we found on his body over the years. This past week my P/A put me on Prednisone because I was still feeling lousy, which is totally abnormal for me since I have always been in excellent health, except for two glitches (I am 58, 135 lbs. I take Synthroid 125 mcg (for approx. 30 years) and had successful colon cancer surgery three years ago); the Prednisone is helping a little more each day with the pain and weakness, but this muscle involvement seems to continue to spread a bit since my abdominal muscles seem to be slightly involved today. P/A has scheduled me to see a Rheumatologist in July, but I am concerned that something may be cooking in me that I should be dealing with now and quite honestly, I am not functioning at a normal level, which is very disturbing to me. I am not depressed, my joints do not hurt. I love life, have much to live for, including the most precious toddler granddaughter anyone could want - and, I have a job I love. I just want to feel better. I have not missed any work, but it is a struggle, to say the least. I I am not tired or sleepy, but those particular areas are very weak.....I have always been strong, happily, so this is quite unusual and upsetting. I eat a pretty decent diet, mostly homemade meals ( I rarely eat meat, but get my protein from nuts and seeds); my glucose and cholesterol levels are, and always have been, well within normal range. Unfortunately, I have been a long-time diet Pepsi drinker, but gave it up when this began....just in case. I walk daily for exercise. I am a non smoker and non drinker....never touched either. My family history does not include anything like this, as far as I know; it does include my maternal grandmother who died of a sudden stroke - and, heart disease in my father (who smoked ). I hope this gives you a decent picture of my current situation. Please know how much I appreciate your input. I thank you wholeheartedly, in advance, for any information you can share.

My (paternal) grandmother had a cerebral (word choice?) aneurysm in her mid-forties and there is a history of heart disease on that side (my father, my father's father, etc).  A (second?; maternal) cousin had an aortic aneurysm (not sure where).  I have no pain, just a transient pulsating feeling in my upper abdomen (epigastric-to-umbilical region - moreso epigastric, though) from time to time (e.g., primarily during times of mild stress or after eating).   I have recently had one or two episodes of numbness in my right leg lately but I'm not sure if that has more to do with the fact that I do a lot of sitting (at work, commute to and from work, etc).  I've noticed an increase in 'heart flutters' - for example, sometimes when I wake up in the morning but before I get out of bed.  Not sure if that's related.  Could be related to caffeine.  I've gotten them as far back as I can remember.When swimming, there are times where I feel like I have heart flutters as well.  It makes me uncomfortable enough to take a break. Typically while doing breast stroke (as apposed to freestyle for some reason).  I'm not even sure why I'm so concerned.  I guess maybe it is because I had a recent episode of nausea brought on by the feeling that I might pass out.  I am NOT pregnant. In fact, I thought it might somehow be related to constipation.  Turns out I was not constipated either.  It was a peculiar feeling and not the first time I've experienced it.  Seemingly, it came out of 'nowhere' - as opposed to something I might have eaten.  I don't know.  I figured I'd give this a shot.
