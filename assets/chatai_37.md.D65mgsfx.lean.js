Before being advised I would like to know your terms and conditions.","Doctor":"Hello and Welcome to ‘Ask A Doctor’ service. I have reviewed your query and here is my advice. A dry scalp can cause dandruff, those embarrassing white flakes that appear on your clothing and your hair. A dry scalp can also be itchy, red, and irritated, and make your hair appear dry and dull. Your scalp can dry out for a number of reasons, including: 1. Eczema 2. Dietary deficiencies 3. Cold and dry weather 4. Too-frequent shampooing 5. Hair products that often contain alcohol, which can dry out your hair. Treatment 1. Conditioning or hot oil treatment at your local drug or beauty supply store. If you use a hot oil treatment, make sure it isn't too hot; warm oil or a deep conditioner applied the scalp twice a week can help moisturize and soothe an itchy, dry scalp. 2. Instead, shampoo every other day with warm (not hot) water; frequent washing and hot water can dry out your hair and your scalp. Also avoid gels, mousses, hairsprays, and other products that contain alcohol and can dry out your scalp and hair. Limit the use of heat appliances, like a blow dryer, to give hair a chance to recover. 3. If a dry scalp is producing white flakes, treat yourself to a gentle scalp massage. Stimulate your scalp with your fingertips as you shampoo or when applying a hot oil or deep conditioning treatment to your scalp. 4. Eating the wrong foods can impact your hair and scalp as well. Too many sugary foods can lead to a dry scalp and cause flaking, so limit desserts and trips to the candy jar. Even spicy foods can trigger dandruff, so try to avoid them and see if you notice any improvement. Please consult your dermatologist he will examine and treat you accordingly. Take care."},{"Patient":"Sir, I am experiencing continuing hair loss (thinning to scalp area) approximately three months after discontinuing the use of Androgel for low testosterone.

There is also recession of anterior hairline in Androgenetic alopecia along with hair Thinning, which is a characteristic feature of Androgenetic alopecia whereas hair thickness is normal in TE.

You can also speak to your dermatologist about PRP where plasma from your own blood is injected into your scalp which further promotes hair growth. Hope I have answered your query.

I also recommend speaking to your dermatologist and considering PRP (platelet rejuvenation plasma) therapy where your own plasma is injected into your scalp with the help of tiny needles. This plasma is rich in platelets and growth factors which further helps in strengthening the hair follicles and promoting new hair growth. This treatment is done once every 4-5 weeks for a minimum of 8-10 times. Also, you could start consuming multivitamin tablets with biotin in them. Hope I have answered your query.

You will have to do adjuvant therapies like hair PRP - platelet rejuvenation plasma treatment, where plasma from your own blood is injected into your scalp with the help of tiny needles. This plasma is rich in growth factors and platelets which further strengthen your follicles and promote new growth.

I have had excessive hair loss.Thank you","Doctor":"Hello and Welcome to ‘Ask A Doctor’ service. Have reviewed your query and here is my advice. Thyroid can have a great effect on hair fall and certainly predispose or aggravate it. You can start with topical Minoxidil solution of 5% to be applied twice daily. One generally needs to be on Minoxidil for at least a year to see optimum result. Along with Minoxidil you should also be on hair nutritional supplements which have Biotin. I also suggest, you get yourself reviewed by the concerned doctor. Hope that helps!"},{"Patient":"sir im 25/m from kerala im facing seviour hair fall and dandruff and started bladness  i cant control it i also has an allergy while consuming alcohol (liquor or beer) i used to drink rarely may 2 or 3 time in a month not regular very next day after i drink i found itching on both hands and legs and it persist maybe even for a week ill get normal after that without any medicine,isit a disease if so how can i cure it is it caused by any problem in my hormones please help sir waiting for your kind advice.","Doctor":"Hello and Welcome to ‘Ask A Doctor’ service. I have reviewed your query and here is my advice. 1) Hairfall: Dandruff can always increase hairfall. Therefore it is vital you can get that under control. You can use scalp shampoo which you will get at any chemist. Apply the shampoo on wet scalp and leave it on for 7-8 mins and then wash it off. Do this 3-4 times a week till the dandruff disappears. 2) Allergy: seems like you are allergic to some component of the alcohol which again is very common. I suggest restrain yourself from alcohol as that can also trigger the hair fall. For both the above issues, have a nutritious diet, do daily exercises for at least 30 mins and have at least 3-4 liters of water. Hope that helps!"},{"Patient":"hello sir, Today I went to a dermatologist for consultation regarding hair loss. He prescribed me logi hair tablets and Morrf 5 %. But I am feeling a bit cynic to start the course as many people say that once we start taking pills for hair fall the hair fall start even more . So, please guide me what to do?","Doctor":"Hello and Welcome to ‘Ask A Doctor’ service. I have reviewed your query and here is my advice. What happens exactly is when you start the treatment new hair comes in place of old hair. Just like a plants grows in place of another. So the old hair fall as it has to make space for the new hair. So it gives false impression that hair fall has increased. In 1 - 2 months it will normalize and you will see increase density of hair. So start treatment without any doubt and wait at least 6 months for the result. Hope I have answered your query.

I also have dandruff. Is this a side effect of telogen effluvium or could this be one of the things causing the hair loss?","Doctor":"Hello and Welcome to ‘Ask A Doctor’ service. I have reviewed your query and here is my advice. Telogen effluvium is sudden acute increase in hair shedding due to a preceding precipitating factor like an illness or weight loss or stressful factor. Dandruff is not associated with increased hair shedding due to Telogen effluvium though it may contribute to the shedding. I suggest you to use a ketoconazole based anti-dandruff shampoo every alternate days. Lather it well on to wet scalp and allow it to act for a 7-10 minutes before rinsing it off. This would take care of the hair fall due to dandruff whereas Telogen effluvium is self-resolving in about 3-6 months following recovery from a stressful event. Hope I have answered your query.

I have reviewed your query and here is my advice. Perhaps you have Telogen Effluvium wherein there is a transient increase in hair shedding due to shift in the hair cycle from growth phase (Anagen) to resting phase (Telogen). I suggest you to take an oral Iron supplement once a day as well as an oral Biotin supplement for a few weeks. You may also use a hair growth stimulant, e.g., Minoxidil 5% solution, twice daily for a few weeks. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further.

But they cause discomfirt and severe hair loss.  Initially they started as harmless small bumps and over few years they have taken this form. Doctors gave me shampoos and local applications - which did not help even a little. I have used oils like ashtabringhandri tailam etc. The itching reduces when my hair is wet or oiled for sometime, but comes back again within few hours. I have stopped using shampoos with chemicals and hair colour sometimes for a month or so, but still the bumps keep coming. Some shampoos have an aggavating effect, (Shampoos like Johnson Babies, Head and Shoulder etc produce more bumps and itching) some have no effect (shampoos like dove - results in neither increase nor decrease of bumps). I am 47 year old, female, not diabetic, over weight, on a break from work and hence not stressed (Currently). I have no other problem except severe itching, bumps and accompanying hair loss. the bumps are mostly on the back of my head and sometimes on the crown. My hair falls off like as it it is too weak to stick on to my scalp. It falls in long strands, many many at a time thruout the day but my pillow does not have any hair fall sign when I get up...

Thank you for writing to usI have gone through your query and I have noted your concern.Perhaps you have an oily scalp and the bumps are  nothing but Scalp acne.

Deficiency of vitamin B3, C , Niacin, Biotin & lack of essential elements like iron & Zinc generally result in hair loss.

I will suggest you the best possible treatment options. 1 ) First of all all do not panic. 2 ) As you might be aware that pregnancy occurs aaround the day of ovulation, and then fertilised egg travels from fallopian tubes to the womb. And after 7 to 10 days it implants in the uterus. 3 ) In some women there is some kind of blood satined discharge , known as implantation bleeding.  Usually, it is very minimal and stops on its own. What you must have noticed xanthine be the same. And blackish or brownish coloration can be due to old and altered bleeding. So If There Is no fresh red bleeding, then you need not worry.  Please be relaxed. Wait for 14 days after the IUI.  If you happen to cross your expected date of cycle, then please get morning's first sample of urine tested for pregnancy. In case of doubt blood beta HCG test and USG will be be of help. I hope this answer helps you. Thanks. May God bless you with a bundle of joy. Thanks.

Usually, fertility returns within 3 to 4 weeks .If you have history of regular cycles then you can start expecting toget pregnant from your current cycle.  As you might be aware that in a woman with regular cycles day 10 to 20 of the cycleis the most fertile periodof cycle. If you have unprotected sex act in the fertile period, then You Stand chance to get pregnant. I will suggest you to start with Folic acid, Vitamin B 12 and Omega 3 supplements at least 3 months before you plan to get pregnant.  This helps to prevent many problems during pregnancy and delivery. I hope this answer helps you. Thanks. Dr . Purushottam Neurgaonkar."},{"Patient":"I have lost my hair about 7 years ago.

As you have mentioned that you have cycles of 30 to 33 days then I will suggest you to get morning's first sample of urine tested for pregnancy a week Later after your expected 33 days. If you do it earlier the tests might be  inconclusive.  In case of doubt blood beta HCG test and USG will be of help. I hope this answer helps you. Thanks.

Androgenic alopecia is a normal physiological process resulting in alopecia (hairloss). Androgens are male sex hormones like testosterone and dihydrotestosterone, which acts on frontal hairs of scalp and causes them to fall. To prevent this you should use 5% minoxidil lotion and anti androgen pills like Finasteride. Just remember that there is no permanent treatment for hair loss. You will see decrease in hair loss and hair regrowth within 3 to 6 months of continuous treatment but once you stop treatment, then you will again start losing hairs.

I have reviewed your query and here is my advice. 1. Hairloss: Hairloss may be due to several reasons like stress. Any stressful condition or any recent disease like malaria typhoid; if hair fall is due to this reason than its temporary and hairs will regrow soon 2. If you have thyroid disease. Get thyroid profile done 3. Vitamin D3 deficiency can result in increased hairfall - get serum vitamin D3 levels done 4. Decreased iron - Get serum ferritin done 5. A type of hair loss in male called androgenic alopecia is due to male hormone testosterone. It is considered to be age phenomenon and in this case hair loss can be prevented by taking anti-testosterone medications in low doses. Along with above you apply minoxidil 5 % lotion all over the scalp before sleep and take biotin pill. 6. Dandruff- Most common cause of dandruff is seborrheic dermatitis in which you have scaling over scalp only but not extending to forehead ( in contrast to psoriasis).For both of these diseases there is no cure but dandruff can be prevented. For dandruff not extending up to forehead you need to use any anti dandruff shampoo. When it goes off put shampoo aside and when it recur then use shampoo again. For dandruff extending up to forehead you need to use shampoo like Protar-K but disease course is same as above.Remember that dandruff has nothing to do with hair loss.Take no stress eat balanced diet and do some exercise.

Increased intake of fried, sour, spicy, salty, and fermented foods, as well as tea and coffee, aggravate the Pitta Dosha in the body. This Pitta accumulates in the skin of the scalp, leading to hair falling out and greying prematurely.Hair loss can be one of the most common signs of iodine deficiency. Iodine, when combined with iron, zinc and magnesium is said to be one of the best minerals that help in maintaining healthy and lustrous hair. Iodine stimulates thyroid gland which helps in strengthening the hair root and boosting hair growth.Excessive consumption is also dangerous. Causes of Hair Fall:-1. A prolonged illness.2. Stress.3. Thyroid hormone imbalance.4. Few Medicines like anticoagulants, medicines used for gout, chemotherapy for cancer, excess of vitamin A, birth control pills and antidepressants.5. Conditions like lupus, diabetes etc.6. Fungal infection of scalp.7. Use of harsh chemicals or hot oil for treatment.8. Anemia.Ayurvedic Home Remedies For Hair Fall:-1.

Fenugreek is very effective in preventing dandruff, hair fall and baldness. Soak fenugreek seeds in water overnight and grind it into a fine paste the following morning. Apply and leave this paste on the scalp for 30 to 45 minutes and then wash it with a mild shampoo.4. Have 1 tsp of amla powder mixed with honey, twice daily after food.5. Take an ounce of aloe vera juice daily before food.6. A spoonful of white sesame seeds each morning can be a great source of magnesium and calcium. They are very effective hair loss checkers.7. A hot oil massage using either coconut, almond or brahmi oil helps improve circulation, rejuvenates your hair follicles, which leads to better blood circulation to the roots.8. Drink adequate amount of water daily.9. Drink fresh juices of carrot, alfalfa, lettuce and spinach for aiding in hair growth.10.Massage aloe vera gel in the hair thoroughly after taking a head bath, leave it for few hours and wash it off with warm water.11.Take green leafy vegetables, raisins, dates, milk, etc.What to Avoid:-1.

There may be some other problems.  Do a thyroid profile and prolactin levels and a ultrasound for your uterus and ovaries.  If everything is fine you can take some medicines like clomiphene for the growth of your follicles and track your follicles growth by repeated ultrasound and when your follicles is more than 17 to 18 mm, take injection for rupturing the follicles.  Be in contact with your husband for 2 to 3 days after injection.  Take progesterone for next 2 weeks.  Do a urine pregnancy test at home after that.  Discuss with your doctor regarding this.

My actual question is that from last year my hair falls very much and i feel some kind of pain on my scalp, it feels like someone has put red pepper on my scalp. can u please help me out. the pain is sometimes unbearable.","Doctor":"Hi,From your history and description, it is possible that the lotion may have affected your scalp and hair roots and damaged them. Weak hair starts falling over a period of time and the new hair will take time to grow, depending on its cycle. Also, the new hair needs to be healthy as well.The lotion may have been too harsh or also may not have suited your skin. Always test any new products on a small patch of skin and observe for 24 hours, before using.Hair fall could be due to other underlying factors like stress, work, poor diet, hair styling products, dandruff, change in water, pollution, etc., commonly.Also, you need to check for other causes like thyroid problems, low iron/hemoglobin, any illness like fever, typhoid, and any long-term medication. Any genetic hair loss, or balding in the family could make you more prone to hair fall and early greying of hair.As for the pain and burning sensation, it may be due to an allergic/irritant reaction of your hair and skin to the lotion. There may have been boils, blisters, etc.Other common causes maybe dandruff or greasy flaky scalp, scalp infections. Hair fall and new hair growth can cause a persistent painful feeling.In females, there may be association of scalp pain with menstrual cycles. To confirm the reason, examination by a dermatologist is necessary for further treatment. You can check with a dermatologist regarding any tests also required to check for these causes.As for hair fall, I would advise you to start on a hair supplement capsule like Keraglo, Hairbless or Follihair daily for 2 to 3 months to see improvement. Any treatment needs to be taken for a few months regularly to see good results. Be sure to take a nutritious diet and adequate rest, avoid stress. Avoid harsh chemicals.Treatment for pain as I mentioned, must be started after reviewing with doctor.You can go in for other cosmetic hair treatments as a later option after consulting dermatologist regarding the necessity.Hope I have answered your query.

It is a common complaint in such cases. Excess heat affects the strength of your hair, causing breaks and burning the roots, making them weak. Even permanent straightening uses harsh chemicals.It could also be due to stress, work, poor diet, other hairstyling products, dandruff, change in water, etc., which have added to the cause. Also, you need to check for other causes like thyroid problems, low iron /hemoglobin, any illness like fever, typhoid, and any long-term medication. Any genetic hair loss, or balding in the family could make you more prone to hair fall.Once the hair roots are damaged or there is hair fall, you will experience this till new strong hair regrows as different hair will fall and grow at different time. This can take a few months. You can check with a dermatologist regarding any tests required to check for these causes, as any underlying cause will affect hair growth.You must firstly avoid heat/chemical treatments as far as possible. Apply warm oil and massage before bath but don't leave it on for more than half hour. At night use Recute or Tressgro serum. Wash 2 to 3 times a week/not more. Use a good shampoo like Renocia or Ducray Anaphase.I would advise you to start on a hair supplement capsule like Keraglo Eva or Follihair containing biotin daily for 2 to 3 months to see improvement. Any treatment needs to be taken for a few months regularly to see good results. Be sure to take a nutritious balanced diet and fluids, adequate rest, and avoid stress. Avoid harsh chemicals. You can go in for other cosmetic hair treatments as a later option after consulting dermatologist regarding the necessity, if you see no improvement over a long-term.Hope I have answered your query.

Can you please suggest me any pill or dietary supplement for this problem of dry skin.","Doctor":"Hello and Welcome to ‘Ask A Doctor’ service.I have reviewed your query and here is my advice.Firstly, you must check if you have just a dry scalp or if it is dandruff due to seborrheic dermatitis, which is due to excessive oiliness leading to flaking of skin and oil along with itching. Sometimes, you may feel small bumps or wounds.Hormonal changes maybe causing the oil level changes at this age and can reduce with time. It would also cause itching and acne like lesions on face, chest and back which are oily. The oil causes fungal growth leading to itching. In this case, oiling hair makes it worse. Weather changes, use of new cosmetics, hair treatments can also cause drying of scalp.You may start with Arcolane or similar antifungal shampoo thrice a week for 2 weeks and then reduce the frequency depending on the result. You will need to review with dermatologist for definitive diagnosis and to observe the improvement. Do not keep scalp oily. This may be the cause of hairfall, so once it shows improvement you can take daily supplement for growth like Keraglo-Men/Follihair.Eat a healthy balanced diet, adequate fluids, and avoid junk food. Avoid hair creams, gels, etc. Start with this treatment and follow-up regularly with dermatologist.

It is nothing to worry about. It may also affect other oily areas like face, chest, upper back. Change in climate, change in shampoo or anything causing oiliness on the scalp could cause an increase. Make sure not to apply more greasy gels, styling products and to wash off conditioner well as this can also dry up and look flaky. Keep your scalp clean and oil free.Another important diagnosis is scalp psoriasis along the hairline. So it is necessary to consult a dermatologist to examine and rule it out. It maybe seasonal as well and may spread.For now apply Salisia-KT or similar shampoo twice a week, avoid prolonged oil application.

I also eat pretty healthy.  By the way, I use to have a great deal of thick, shiny, healthy hair.  I probably have less than a quarter of that now.

Thank you.","Doctor":"Hello and Welcome to ‘Ask A Doctor’ service.I have reviewed your query and here is my advice.Given your history and medical details, I assume you are a 44 years old female experiencing this hair loss. How long ago did it start? Any probable causes you can think of prior to it starting? Maybe an illness, fever, typhoid, prolonged stress or trauma, change in location of residence or lifestyle, any new medications started, or use of any hair products or dyes previously? Is the skin of your scalp is normal? Have you checked any history of thyroid illness? Is there a family history? Female pattern baldness could be a reason, mainly genetic. Going by your age, hormonal changes close to menopause could also affect hair fall and growth cycle, slowing it down considerably. Is there hair loss elsewhere on the body? Narrowing down on a probable cause can help make changes.As for treatment, continue your healthy balanced diet with sufficient protein, and veggies for vitamins and minerals. Adequate water, rest. Avoid stress and pollution. Continue avoiding chemical hair products and styling. Use a hair growth shampoo and conditioner like hair4U or Renocia, Anaphase. Apply scalp massage oils like warm almond or coconut oil before a bath or overnight. Take a hair supplement capsule daily such as Keraglo-Eva.Keep in mind that the cause of your hair fall must be corrected and also will take 2 to 3 months to see the results. Visit your dermatologist to check your blood for hemoglobin, iron, thyroid levels and a general check of your health. They can also rule out other possible causes after an examination.Hope I have answered your query.

You have not mentioned, is there any history of any illness, fever such as typhoid, viral, or any other medication you are taking regularly? Also, is it related to pregnancy or delivery recently? In these cases there may be a hair fall which will take time to grow back to normal as body recovers. This can take a few months to improve as the hair has to get back to its regular growth cycle. Also, the body had to get back to its strength and nutrition. Genetic or family associated hair loss and receding hair line can make you prone to the same.Please rule out other factors, as well, such as poor nutrition, stress, lack of rest, low iron and hemoglobin levels, thyroid disorders.Dandruff, chemical treatments, and dyes on hair can also aggravate hair fall.For your hair to grow well, it needs sufficient nutrition. Water change, work stress, pollution, etc., are the factors.Any illness or course of medication, application, etc., could slow the growth.These causes need to be considered and treated as they affect hair growth since, it is a long-term complaint for you so necessary steps can be taken and changes to be made.For now you may start with Ducray Anaphase shampoo.

You have not mentioned your age, but it is necessary to get your periods and hormones in balance.Imbalance may be indicated by irregular menstrual cycles, changes in normal hormonal levels , PCOD problems, excess acne, hair growth, weight gain etc. Stress may add to it. But it is necessary for you to first treat any menstrual irregularity. Also check for thyroid disorders etc. A family history of hair fall can also influence your hair fall.Keep a strict nutritious diet, exercise and avoid stress.

You can't ovulate just after your periods.  It takes atleast 10 to 14 days for ovulation to happen after your first day of periods.

Be in contact with your husband every 2 to 3 days after your periods stop.  It will increase chances of your pregnancy. hope I have answered your question.

Vitamins and minerals especially vit B12, zinc and cooper are responsible for the proper nourishment of the hair, also if the body is suffering from the lacks of vitamin C and E than hair turns into gray very normally.If you want to avoid premature graying of the hair try to fill your diet with these substances also try to take some daily supplements that contain the vitamins mentioned above.Also you can try the  Phyto Phytocyane shampoo twice a week and ampoules Phytociane 1 ampoule 2 times per week.Sometimes it\`s totally possible that gray hairs turn into black hair.I wish you good health!Please feel free to contact me again if anything is unclear.Dr. Migena GEGA"},{"Patient":"I dont know what to do have hit a brick wall with my doctor..for over 6 months I have noticed a dramatic loss of hair.

So, you will need some medicines for ovulation.  You can take some medicines like clomiphene for the growth of your follicles and track your follicles growth by repeated ultrasound and when your follicles is more than 17 to 18 mm, take injection for rupturing the follicles.  Be in contact with your partner 2 to 3 days after injection.  Take progesterone for next 2 weeks.  Do a urine pregnancy test at home after that.  Hope I have answered your question.

Genetic or male pattern balding is most common. Stress and unhealthy diet causes deficiency in the body, and therefore causes hair to fall and become unhealthy, and makes the growth slow. It will take time and good treatment for new hair growth.It is a common complaint and could be also increased due to stress, work, hair styling products, dandruff, change in water etc commonly.Also you need to check for other causes like thyroid problems, low iron /hemoglobin, any illness like fever, typhoid, any long term medication. Any genetic hair loss, or balding in the family could make you more prone to hair fall.You can check with a dermatologist regarding any tests required to check for these causes.I would advise you to start on a hair supplement capsule like Keraglo Men or Follihair daily for 2-3 months to see improvement with applications advised. Any treatment needs to be taken for a few months regularly to see good results. Consult the doctor regarding how long to continue fenpecia and tugain but do apply it regularly and do not stop till advised so.Be sure to take a nutritious diet and adequate rest, avoid stress. Avoid harsh chemicals.Finpecia tablets will help you a lot if you have a genetic or family history of balding. It would be better to slowly reduce and stop the finpecia after consulting your doctor, if you ever experience any side effects. But they are usually rare. Some patients do have a bit of hairfall on stopping treatment but it is usually temporary. So dont stop any medication suddenly.Use a suitable shampoo and conditioner like Hair4U.Hope this helps you"},{"Patient":"hi sir,my age is 26(M) years & am suffering from hair fall since 6 month.i have consult to a doctor.he suggest me to apply MorrF & folifast solution daily,it 45 days passed but there is no remedy.can i continue this medicine or go to some other doctor.","Doctor":"hey , i can understand your concern,you can get your hemoglobin, serum ferritin and thyroid levels tested.sometimes hairfall is due to dysbalance of all these,if all the parameters turns out to be normal than minoxidil application and biotins once a day for a long period of time can be helpful.but its a long therapy, you will get the evident results after three months , so be patient.good luck"},{"Patient":"Hi doctor,This is kavya.

This can take a few months to improve as the hair has to get back to its regular growth cycle. Also, the body had to get back its strength and nutrition. The overall hair growth and rate of growth may be affected more in your case due to other causes as well.Genetic or family associated hair loss and receding hair line can make you prone to the same.In your case, the hair fall ,maybe prolonged due to other factors as well, such as poor nutrition, stress, lack of rest, low iron and hemoglobin levels, Dandruff,Chemical treatments,dyes on hair can also aggravate hair fall.For your hair to grow well, it needs sufficient nutrition.Fever, typhoid, recent illness, water change, work stress, pollution etc is a factor.Any illness or course of medication, application etc could slow the growth.These causes need to be considered and treated as they affect hair growth.For now you may start with Ducray Anaphase shampoo. Apply almond oil or Recute hair oil to stimulate new growth. This needs to be continued at least for 2-3 months to see results.

Capsules and hair oil can be started to reduce hair fall and help new hair growth. But the cause of your hair fall must be treated first.For the dandruff, please continue an antidandruff shampoo regularly at least twice a week, such as Arcolane or Nizoral.  The shampoo must be continued atleast once weekly even after healing, to prevent it coming back, as your skin is oily and prone to dandruff. It is your skin type and it may reduce with age. Avoid oiling scalp or applying gels, styling products. Keep hair clean and dry and try to avoid pollution. it may also be affected by weather/climate change etc. The white powdery stuff is due to scalp flaking and build up of oil due to dandruff, so use the shampoo regularly.Start with this treatment. Be sure to re check with a doctor regarding the improvement in few weeks, to advise regarding further treatment.Once the dandruff clears, hair fall will also reduce. And treatment for hair fall and growth can be started. You will need a multivitamin capsule like Follihair or Biotee daily. Apply Tress Gro hair serum at night to scalp. Use a good shampoo like Anaphase or Renocia. But first treat the dandruff and continue the antidandruff treatment atleast once in 7-10 days.Oiling the hair may be done only before bath for about 30 mins and wash off. Eat a nutritous diet and get rest. avoid stress. Any other illnesses, medication, low iron, thyroid disorders etc can also cause hair fall so check if necessary.Hope this helps you."},{"Patient":"Hi im an 18 year old male who has been on lexapro for about 6 months i had very thick hair before and now am thinning greatly all over and it does not follow mpb.

You will need more specific treatments for the same. You can continue with the tablets and gel application, they help give nutrition for hair growth, but will not treat the reaction in your body. For that you will need stronger medication like steroids.I would advise you to see a dermatologist regarding steroid injections in the bald areas. This will stop the reaction from spreading and slowly stop the hairfall. It also gives faster hair growth. In many cases it gives a good permanent resolution. But since it is an allergic or immunity related disease, it can happen again in new areas. You will need to follow up regularly and take proper treatment. You may also have to check for other diseases like thyroid disorders, white patches(vitiligo) or anemia which have similar causes.There are also newer options which can be tried along with your present medications.

Consult your doctor regarding starting minoxidil application, once the itching stops. It will help your new hair growth.

Wait for your cycle. Two options again. 1. If you menstruate as normal then be happy you are not pregnant  2. In case you don't menstruate, wait for 3 to 4 days and get a upt check with kits available. Don't worry. We can still manage either ways. Hope this helps you and you can contact back anytime."},{"Patient":"I have yellow sticky fluid that comes and goes. When I itch it it puses more. It turns into a scab when it dries up an then i get a white flaky like dandruf. I was working in severly hot weather but I dont think this was the case. Is there any home remedy I can use for this? I think I got it from a tanning bed with dirty pillows. Do I have some kind of fungus?","Doctor":"hello and welcome to HCMFrom your description it seems that you probably have a case of severe seborrheic dermatitis or dandruff on which you have developed infection. Is is a reaction of the skin where there is excessive oily scalp which increases chance of fungal growth and itching, leading to scabs and pus. It may have been aggravated by hot weather.You will require an antidandruff shampoo (antifungal with salicylic acid) at least twice a week till it reduces. After this continue the shampoo atleast once a week to maintain the results as your skin is prone to dandruff.Over the scabs you may apply a steroid+antibiotic combination cream for a week.Hope these tips help according to your symptoms, but do consult a dermatologist regarding further treatment and to rule out other infections and other conditions which may appear the same way.Avoid oiling your hair or applying greasy or other styling products for now.Hope this helps."},{"Patient":"hello please can you help me i have long brown hair and my prob is over the last 2weeks i have had a very itchy dry scalp it seems like i have a couple of little lumps come up at the back of my head and its very very sore it hurts when i put my hand on the back of my scalp plus i washe my hair this morning and it still just the same i have been couloring my hair 1 evey six weeks and the name of it is clairol nice and easy  number 116a and its permanent and the shampoo i use is L/oreal and some time ago my doctor gave me betnovate scalp application 2 put on 2 times a week which i have been doing when i get a dry scalp i have used this scalp application 100 ml in a couple of days when i put it on the sore bits it cools it down then it starts all over again sore ect ect i can tell my scalp is so dry i think its cos i have coulored my hair a lot over the past years ect ect  and i have damaged my scalp am i right ? the thing is i am hopeing to get in and see the doctor 2 morrow about it but i would like to no what you think ?            and what i want to do is to go blonde and stay blonde all the time and not change it back to brown keep it like it all the times but what i can not understand is i have been coulouring my hair 4 years and why is it my scalp is like it is is it the amonia thats doing it if it is when i go to get a blonde coulour i will make sure it hasnt got amonia in it well i think thats about it ty 4 takeing the time to read this and i am sorry if i have made mistakes                                                                              hope to hear back from you and thank- you","Doctor":"hello and welcome to HCMAs you have described, you may be having an allergic reaction or irritant reaction to the harsh chemicals you have been using. They will definitely dry your scalp and hair as well. The bumps and itching at the back of your scalp may also be due to dandruff. You can continue the Betnovate whenever you have severe itching or new rashes for a few days at a time, but also use an anti dandruff shampoo weekly and continue it. Do not apply excessive oil, mousse, styling products etc.If it still persists, do try a different hair colour or natural methods.but I would advise you to avoid these chemical treatments while your scalp is affected, till it healsVisit your dermatologist tomorrow for exact diagnosis and treatment, as this will keep recurring if not diagnosed.Hope this helps."},{"Patient":"Dear doc,I'm 19 year old height 179 cms wieght : 62 kgs. I have been experiencing a lot of hair loss lately. I've observed dandruff in my hair too. Though I've used a few anti-dandruff shampoos(recommended by dermatologists) the hairfall isnt stopping, is my hairfall due to something else ? Kindly advise.","Doctor":"Hi and welcome to HCMAs you have mentioned, dandruff and oily scalp can cause hairfall as it also makes you prone to fungal infections. Do remember that your scalp has an oily nature similar to people with oily skin, and requires continuous care. You will have to start an anti dandruff shampoo twice weekly as advised till the dandruff is in control, after that you must continue at least once weekly to maintain. Do not apply extra oil or styling products on the hair.Other causes for your hair fall maybe stress, pollution, change in water, any recent illness like typhoid, any hormonal or menstrual disorders, thyroid problems, hair straightening etc. It may also be genetic.if you can identify a cause , avoid it and make necessary changes. It is also important to eat nutritious diet and rest well. Low iron etc can also cause it. You can start biotin 10mg capsule daily for 2 months. Once the dandruff reduces, you can apply Tress gro hair serum at night. Wash with shampoo like anaphase etc.Do keep in mind that it will take a month or two to see results.Hope this helps."},{"Patient":"sir, last year i lost a lot of hair due to typhoid..i am losing 20-30 hair strands daily..please suggest me some medicines which will cure my hair falling problem and also will help me in regaining my lost hair...sir plzz give me a permanent solution of this..also the medicines should have no side effects.","Doctor":"Hello and welcome to HCMCertain illnesses like typhoid can cause weakness and hair fall. it is generally temporary and new hairs will grow back as the body recovers, so don't worry.You can take a capsule like Biotin 10mg daily for 2 months as a supplement for hair. Also apply Recute hair oil at night to the scalp. Do this regularly, and keep in mind that it will take around a month to see results as your hair fall reduces and new hair grows.You can also check your hemoglobin, iron levels as low levels can also aggravate the problem.Keep a nutritious diet, get rest and avoid stress and pollution. Dont use harsh chemicals or styling products on hair. You can use Hair4U shampoo and conditioner as well.Don't worry, keep these tips in mind and you will see improvement, but be patient.Hope this helps."},{"Patient":"I Am suffering from hair fall from past 2 years.I Am suffering from hair fall from past 2 years....I Am suffering from hair fall from past 2 years.I Am suffering from hair fall from past 2 years....I Am suffering from hair fall from past 2 years.I Am suffering from hair fall from past 2 years.............","Doctor":"Hi and thank you for contacting HCMYou seem to be greatly disturbed by your hairfall as you have repeated many times.I would have liked if you added some details of yourself as well such as age, sex, illnesses, etc.If you are male, family history of hair loss or balding is an important cause which can affect you. It may start quite early in some people esp if there is any added stress, illnesses, medications, etcOther causes maybe dandruff, change in lifestyle, shifting to a new place, recent fever, typhoid, other sickness, any new regular medications, chemical treatments and beauty treatment for hair. Also esp in females hormonal problems maybe associated. Any history of thyroid disorders, menstrual problems.If you can identify the cause, i would advise you to treat it accordingly after consulting a dermatologist. Check the hemoglobin and iron levels of blood as well.Reduce stress, pollution, eat well with lot of vitamins and minerals as it is important for hair. get rest.Add a biotin 10mg capsule daily for at least 2 months. Apply tress gro or recute hair solution at night to scalp.You will gradually notice improvement in hair fall and new growth, but continue the treatment.

Your response is highly awaited.Thank You","Doctor":"Hi and welcome to HCMFrom your history you seem to be suffering from a condition called alopecia areata where hair is lost in patches usually on scalp, beard. You seem to be progressing towards alopecia totalis, which involves the body hair as well.Is is what we call autoimmune disease where your own body reacts against itself, here against the hair.It may continue to spread or grow back on its own at intervals depending on the immune reaction of your body. I would advise you to consult a dermatologist to assess the exact type of hair loss. Also you may be tested for other such conditions like thyroid disorder. Does anyone else in the family have similar complaints. Did you have any illness before the symptoms started?You can start on minoxidil solution application on the beard and head every night, along with hair supplements like keraglo men capsules. But further treatment options are required, so do consult a dermatologist who may prescribe steroids, steroid injections and other immune regulating meds.Hope this helps."},{"Patient":"Hello, My name is Hardik Panchal and my age is 27, height is 5''8', and weight is 75. since last 3 months my hair lossed significantly, and in scalp there is round spot where all hair has lost.

Did you consult a dermatologist last time?Certain infection can cause loss of hair but you would also have other skin symptoms in that area. Did the previous hair lost grow back?If it is just unexplained loss of hair in patches and repeating, it s mostly alopecia areata.Do you have any other illnesses or allergic conditions? Or family history of similar complaints?You can use a minoxidil 5% solution at night on the area for a month and observe with hair supplements such as as Keraglo men capsules daily.You can also try steroid creams to stop the progress. But these methods take time.I would advise you to consult a dermatologist to confirm the diagnosis and start steroid injection in the area which gives good results. Other options can also be discussed. keep in mind that they can recur in other areas again or sometimes regrow on its own and recover. Also check if you experience hair loss anywhere else on body.Hope this helps."},{"Patient":"my hairs are thin and weak, i want my hairs to be long and strong, iam using garnier shampoo and its conditioner is it good for hairs...?.which shampoo is good...?my hairs are too thin due to hair fall please say me treatment for this.....i want my hairs to be long.....also i jave eye sight problem...","Doctor":"Hi and welcome to HCMFirstly you need to check if there is any cause of your hair fall and thinning if it started recently. Any history of illness, fever, new medication, change in residence, any hair treatment, colouring or regular use of hair dryer or hair ironing/straightening,etc. You need to make sure to eat a nutritious diet with vitamins and minerals and avoid stress. Rest well. Any dandruff?Apart from these you can take a vitamin supplement for hair like Follihair capsules once daily for 2 months. Use a gentle hair growth shampoo such as Anaphase or Renocia. You can also apply hair growth serum on scalp at night such as Recute. Remember all treatments will take 2-3 months to work well.Also rule out any thyroid or other hormonal problems, iron deficiency. You have not mentioned your age, so rule out genetic related hair thinning.Avoid strong chemicals.

Even after you see the dandruff reduce ,do use it atleast once a week to maintain clean scalp as you are prone to dandruff. The dandruff can also cause your hairfall so keep it in control. Don't apply any extra oil/gels etc.As for HVit, you must take it for atleast 2-3 months to see effects. It is just a multivitamin for the hair growth and will not have such side effects.Also maintain healthy diet, reduce fats. Get good rest and avoid stress.Hair fall will take a coule of months to reduce and for new hair to grow.Hope this helps."},{"Patient":"Hi,My age is 29.

Also, would put you on a hair serum containing peptides for hair growth at night.(Q sera etc).

I have gone through a genetic test that showed that I haven't inherited androgenic alopecia and also nobody from my family is bold. I have no problems with the glands as I have been tested several times. Last year I had a standard operation for removal of a benign tumor in my uterus called mioma but my hairloss had started 2 years before that. And my female organs are still intact. I live and work in a foreign country and I sometimes think my problem might be caused by stress. What I know for sure is that this has been driving me crazy for along time now and is my biggest fear and the more I think about it the worse it gets. I have recently broken up with my boyfriend and the main reason is that I can't stand myself the way I am now. I know that this problem can ruin my whole life... Recently I have started thinking that the only think I can do is committing a suicide which I know is a crazy thought. But seems like the only possible outcome if that problem persists. I also don't think I suffer from depression because when I have my so called \\"good days\\" with my hair I am absolutely fine and feel happy and all in the world is good. One more thing: I have had constipation for the past 20 years and started taking herbal medicines 15 years ago. I simply can't live without taking them. Recently read that there are some microorganisms in the stomach that might cause hairloss if they more that normal. Really don't know what to think.

Also, would put you on solution containing 5%/10% minoxidil once a day and a hair serum/gel containing peptides for hair growth at night.(Q sera, Grocapix etc).

Hair fall is usually ascribed to multiple factors like diet and nutrition, hormones, stress, acute or chronic medical conditions,drugs,cosmetic products etc.From your description, it seems you might be having Telogen Effluvium, which is hairfall secondary to any form of stress.Stress factor in your case seems to be diabetes, hypothyroidism and hormonal changes during pregnancy and lactation.If i were your dermatologist/trichologist, i would recommend some special investigations like trichogram and dermoscopy and further aid in diagnosis and prognosis.I would suggest you a course of oral tablets containing biotin and other essential vitamins and minerals for minimum 3-6 months. Also, would put you on solution containing 5% minoxidil once a day and a hair serum containing peptides like acetyl tetrapeptides and biochanin etc at night. I would advise use of gentle shampoo and conditioner on regular basis and use of coconut oil twice a week.Also enquire from your dermatologist about upcoming treatment options like mesotherapy and platelet-rich plasma.Avoid combing in wet hair and let them dry by wrapping in towel. Avoid blow dryers and hair-color/dyes. Take plenty of fresh fruits and vegetables in your diet and try to de-stress your routine life.Hope your queries are resolved and wish you best of health.Thank youDr Hardik Pitroda"},{"Patient":"hi doctor, i m 24yr old girl but have a serious hair fall problems.also i feel i smoke a lot that could be the reason.i smoke 10ciggarettes a day and this hair fall problem is happening for last 1yr now.i m left with very little hair.what do u suggest???","Doctor":"HIWell come to HCMI really appreciate your concern, some conditions are there as long as the hair fall is concern in female and these are hire root fungal infection, hormone changes, endocrine dysfunction, mal nutrient, stress, and these all need to be ruled out and differentiated till then condition can be managed with \\"Minoxidile 5 %\\" to be applied on scalp   hope this information take care and have a nice day."},{"Patient":"Hello Doctor .....Im 25 year old female,my problem is my hair loss at the front portion of my head,almost looks like getting bald(I have never seen like this in women)...I have undergone harmone tests and found a very little variation in my thyroid level(Hypothyroidism)...I have taken Levothyroxine for 50 mg for 6 months and doctor said everything is back in track ........Im doing good excersises maintaining a good vegiterian diet....but my hair is not growing back.....Can you please suggest me something which grows my hair back....Im so depressed because of this....I hate to face my friends,hate to face cameras.....Please help me out from this disaster.....","Doctor":"HIWell come to HCMI really appreciate your concern, this is less common in female (Hair fall ) most of the time it could be due to fungal disease of hair root, and it need to be ruled out and for that clinical examination is must, thyroid hormone has nothing to do with this, mean while you can try \\"Minoxidile 5 %\\" lotion to be applied on scalp, hope this information helps, take care and have a nice day."},{"Patient":"I had Typhoid three months back.

It is diffuse hair loss in which hairs from all over the scalp tend to fall off. It is because typhoid is a disease which affects your immune system as well as leads to nutritional imbalance which is a further drain on the body's resources.Such a hair loss gradually tends to get better with passage of time and such reversal point cannot be predicted.  Most likely, you too will get better soon.

In your case due to coexisting Seborrhic Dermatitis, it is better not to use irritants as they can enhance itching and flakiness caused by the latter condition.You might alos attend more carefully about hair hygiene, regular walks, avoidance of hair cosmetic preparations and improve diet to  gain health benefits.I believe this helps you in early recovery.Our best wishes!"},{"Patient":"I am on the following medications: Mucinex, potassium, calcium, Evista, Diovan, Singular, HCTZ, Ranitidine, Vit D3, Tramadol, Naprosin, Lyrica, Advair discus.

People don't take care of the diet they have.I suggest you to please improve your diet and keep proteins (skimmed milk, eggs, fish) in your diet in handsome amount. Add green leafy vegetables and salads too. Plenty of water and a good physical activity is a must.I want to add a supplement specially for your needs. Capsule perfectil for skin hair and nails, once daily. It will definitely help you get better hair very soon.Hope I answered all of your questions. Please don't forget to add your precious positive feedback to help me able to assist you better in future too. Have a wonderful time ahead. Keep in touch for a follow-up too.Regards!DR. MUHAMMAD HANIFUSA"},{"Patient":"My age is 21and Am facing severe hair loss which is shocking by all for my age.I follow proper diet and no dandruff. I had earlier consulted with v care and other dermatologists still am having the same problem .They prescribed finasteride and minoxidil which I continued for the term they said .I never felt any improvement and my hair loss leads to depression and feeling low to face society. Please help me with proper guidance.             Drugs used : finasteride,minoxidil, keraxyl serum,ervamatin            Problem:hair thinning and missing in central part alone.","Doctor":"I welcome your here at HCM!I  feel sorry that the treatment didn't work for you. I want to clarify that you need the treatment for years long. There is no defined period of time that you will take the medicine for and then stop and all is ok. You are suffering from Androgenetic alopecia and it needs proper and long term care. Minoxidil for example when used continuously, starts kicking in and  showing results after a lag period of 6 months or so. And its effects revert once you stop the medication.In male hairfall has a strong genetic association. Females have their own different reasons of the issue. Dandruff is the most serious a reason of this problem and is common in both genders.You don't have dandruff issues, that is relaxing and makes the diagnosis of male pattern baldness more clear.Take a bath daily but use shampoo twice to thrice a week only.Remember!Don't use hot water for it. Normal water helps improve this condition by reducing dryness and dandruff.Keep your hair properly trimmed. It will help make the hair look even all around cosmetically and also it will help hairfall to decrease to a significant level.When young patients come to me I usually prescribe them to take Capsule Perfectil for hair nails and skin. It will catch up the deficiencies and your hair nails and skin will glow and grow optimally.Take plenty of fluids and fruits. Green leafy vegetables and salads are good for you. Exercises on regular basis will help you a lot.Minoxidil 5% spray is also beneficial when you will continue using it in the long run. But if it causes dandruff or allergy stop using Minoxidil. You used it already so I think you are not allergic to it.Males get benefit and a noticeable improvement by taking tablet Genesis (finasteride). Same as for Minoxidil, it is also to be taken for long time. What actually is the mechanism of action of finasteride; it stops the male hormone Testosterone conversion to its dangerous and hair enemy metabolite called DHT. This process is stopped at the cellular levels in the peripheral tissues.It's a time taking process to kick in properly and shows results after a lag period of 5-6 months or so. Male baldness is mostly due to peripheral Testosterone (named DHT) effects that destroy specific hair follicles on top (crown) and front of the scalp.This management will help you a lot. Have a nice time ahead. Don't forget to give your best positive feedback. If you need further assistance, feel free to contact me back anytime.Regards! DR.

To me it appears that there have been some missing pieces of information in your account related to the size and location, demarcation, and pattern of hair loss bur based on your description I feel that you are most likely having Alopecia Areata.For my patients who attend in person, i usually esquire about the history of allergies (atopy) in the family, symptoms, examination of few hairs plucked from the margins of lesions and family history apart from the scrapings from scalp skin. Then, when the diagnosis of AA is established I put them on Folica for few weeks, to be supplemented with steroids locally, intralesionally if necessary either through a delicate needle-syringe or by dermaroller.

My view is that: 1 You seem to be referring to Male Pattern Baldness which has a hereditary basis and that initially affects the frontal and crown areas before spreading to other scalp areas.2 had you not been suffering from hair loss already, I would have advised to wait since not all male members of a family actually face the problem.3 In a case like yours, Monoxidil 5% seems best option. It has to be applied twice a day in a dose of 1 ml or 15 drops each time to dry hairs of affected areas.4 This drug is effective as long as you continue with treatment,5 Minoxidil might show a lag period of up to 4 months or so before you notice any improvement6I would also advise you to refrain from using Finasteride at this stage especially if you are younger than 40 yrs or so.Most of my patients respond to this regime so well that I rarely have to resort to other treatments.Patience and regularity are the key to good results.Best wishes for your recovery!"},{"Patient":"Hi, may I answer your health queries right now ?

The disease tends to spread at the periphery.The therapies that you have tried are not specific to LPP. Specific treatment of LPP is with Oral steroids which would arrest further progression as well as reverse early damage.

A good drug fro the condition is Biotin which works very well but takes several weeks or longer to show improvement.5 several patients respond well to treatment using lasers, especially the Hairmax that can be used at home.6 For dandruff, it helps to use shampoos containing ZPTO and Ketoconazole roughly twice a week or so. 7 Besides, a good diet, exercise. and healthy lifestyle are the basis of our wellness.I am sure these measures will help you.Best wishes"},{"Patient":"Hi, I am 27 yrs, 5.7\\", 58 Kgs.

I'm a 24 year old girl...suferring from a hair loss problemMy docter suggested me trigaine solution...He didn't tell me about the side effects neither did he tell me how to apply this solution on the effected area....I stopped using the oil today after reading the side effects on wikipedia....I'm really very worried....I used this oil for 17 days....the area i applied this solution on itches when I comb it...and when I shampoo that area after scratching.....And i used to apply 3ml on the afected area.","Doctor":"Hello. Thank you for writing to us at healthcaremagicThe solution that you have been using contains a combination of minoxidil, tretinoin and azaleic acid.It is not a hair oil and actually has an alcohol base. It should be applied with the help of a dropper at scalp skin rather than on hair length.The quantity recommended is just 1 ml, once daily.It should be applied on thoroughly clean scalp, once daily at night. Hair oil use is not recommended while you are on treatment.It is advisable to shampoo daily while you are on treatment.It should not be applied on wet scalp/ hair as the concentration of its ingredients may get diluted.The method of its application is to start from the center of the scalp and gradually move outwards.Minoxidil is an approved hair growth promoter, whereas azaleic acid is mainly added due to its anti-DHT actions (dihydrotestosterone). DHT is the main culprit behind hair loss and thinning in androgenetic alopecia. Tretinoin role is to enhance the penetration of these agents.Itching is either because of dryness/ scaling which is common with this solution because it is constituted in an alcohol base Or it could be because of sensitivity  to one of the ingredients Or else it could be because of irritation if you were using in more than recommended quantity i.e 1 ml.I suggest you to discontinue it for the time being and seek another appointment with your dermatologist for an assessment of possible side effects and treatment for the same.Regards"},{"Patient":"My hair are falling since past many years.I've lost the hair from the front both sides but still it is not lost much from the middle.I think it's the beginning of going bald.Also my profession is IT industry and it causes stress,On many sites I've seen finastride,minoxidil etc for treatment.My problem is that I always have white flakes on my hair even if I've done shampoo or put oil,by putting oil it's less than usual but still there.Can you prescribe me with some medications which can help me.I normally eat vegetables and protein rich diet.I don't drink alcohol or smoke and rarely I eat non-veg","Doctor":"Hello,Welcome to healthcare magic,From your description of the distribution of hair loss it looks like you have a patterned hair fall seen in Male pattern baldness. There are US FDA approved treatments for it like topical minoxidil 5 % solution 1ml twice daily over affected area and Finasteride tablets. Why don't you start with medications after consulting a dermatologist ? Initiation of treatment early is very important in baldness because once hair follicle is gone it won't regrow. One thing you should realize is this hair loss is in your genes. Whatever treatment you will be on will halt the process. Once treatment is stopped genes will take over. So we need to maintain the treatment on a long term.Dandruff could be due to either Psoriasis or Seborrhoeic dermatitis. Dermatologist will be able to diagnose it after examining.

Hair fall is usually ascribed to multiple factors like diet and nutrition, hormones, stress, acute or chronic medical conditions,drugs,cosmetic products etc.Its difficult to put a definitive diagnosis in absence of clinical examination. From your description, it seems you are suffering from either Androgenetic alopecia (due to hormones and genetically determined) or Telogen effluvium (Due to any recent stressful event or any other medical condition)If i were your dermatologist/trichologist, i would like to take through history including family history, history of recent major trauma /illness/ stress/ medications etc, your menstrual history and recommend some basic investigations like CBC,blood sugar,Thyroid function test.Also some other special tests like trichogram and dermoscopy can aid in diagnosis and prognosis.I would suggest you a course of oral tablets containing biotin and other essential vitamins and minerals (Tab. Follihair new) for minimum 6 months. Also, would put you on solution containing 5%/10% minoxidil once a day and a hair serum/gel containing peptides for hair growth at night.(Q sera, Grocapix etc). I would advise use of gentle shampoo and conditioner on regular basis and use of coconut oil twice a week.Also enquire from your dermatologist about upcoming treatment options like mesotherapy and platelet-rich plasma.Avoid combing in wet hair and let them dry by wrapping in towel.

As you have regular cycles, please get ovulation study on USG from day 10 of the cycle to know about the day of ovulation. 3. Post menstrual HSG - hysterosalpingography, within first ten days of the cycle will be helpful to know about the patency of fallopian tubes. 4. Please get husband's semen analysis done with abstinence of  3 to 5 days.  This helps to know about quality and quantity of sperms. 5. You can simply opt for unprotected sex act on and around the day of ovulation. 6, Lastly, about your concern of seminal fluid coming out of vagina. Normally, the motile sperms start travelling inside the womb and the seminal fluid remains in the vagina. This fluid leaks out of vagina after some time.  So you need not worry about it.

This fungus lives in oily skin.Use a shampoo containing Ketoconazole 2% and ZPTO 1% thrice a week for a month. After that continue using once a week at least for maintaining the improvement. Do not apply oil on your scalp. You mentioned that you have receding hair line. Is your hair loss mainly from front and top of scalp? If so it could be due to male pattern baldness. Mintop forte solution is the FDA approved treatment for baldness. One thing you should realize is that baldness  is in the genes. Whatever treatment you will be on will halt the process.

I will suggest you the best possible treatment options. As you might be aware that PCOS is a lifestyle disorder, and it gets improved with lifestyle changes.  I will suggest you to opt for a healthy diet and regular exercise regimen. Include more portions of fruits, salads and vegetables in daily diet. Drink plenty of water in the day. Avoid deep fried foods, bakery products and refined sugars. Avoid substance abuse if any. Start on Folic acid, Vitamin B 12 and Omega 3 supplements at least 3 months before you plan to get pregnant. This helps to prevent many problems during pregnancy and delivery . Along with that, medical treatment options for PCOS are -Insulin sensitisers like metformin, laparoscopy for ovarian surface drilling and tubal patency. With normal semen analysis reports, you can have ovulation study on USG and opt for natural unprotected sex act or IUI on the day of ovulation. This will help you to get pregnant.

The problem is with your ovulation.  So, you can take some medicines like clomiphene for the growth of your follicles and track your follicles growth by repeated ultrasound and when your follicles is more than 17 to 18 mm, take injection for rupturing the follicles.  Be in contact with your husband for 2 to  3 days after injection.  Take progesterone for next 2 weeks.  Do a urine pregnancy test at home after that.  For now, you can take some progesterone for inducing periods.  Consult a doctor.  Abortion rates are higher in PCO.  Hope I have answered your question.

Thank you for writing to usYou seem to have telogen effluvium. Underlying thyroid is one of the causes of telogen shedding.Once the underlying cause is corrected hair fall would still take 1-3 months to recover.This is because hairs that are already in telogen phase will shed over the next 1-3 months and only then these hair follicles would re-enter growth phase (anagen) and start producing new hair.Minoxidil helps in faster transition from telogen to anagen.This may in fact manifest as further increased hair shedding once patient starts using minoxidil because of anagen hair that is growing that pushes out telogen hair and may manifest as increased hair fall. This increased shedding in response to minoxidil is known as anagen surge.This reaction to minoxidil is actually quite welcome because telogen hair that were going to be shed over a longer period of time are shed faster due to anagen hair growing and pushing telogen hair out.Therefore I suggest you to continue with the treatment for thyroid as well as topical minoxidil and hopefully your hair fall will recover soon.Regards"},{"Patient":"I was diagnosed 3 months with Rickettsial disease.

Thank you for writing to us.The reason for precipitous hair fall after a major illness/ stressful event is known as telogen effluvium.The hair loss that you now experience post-rickettsial illness is actually quite expected.Telogen efluvium usually starts 1-3 months after a stressful event. This stressful event can be a medical illness like e.g dengue , malaria, jaundice etc Or ricketsial disease as in your case.Telogen effluvium is due to sudden shift in hair growth cycle from Anagen, which is the growth phase to Telogen, which is the resting phase.Once hair enters telogen in response to a stresful event, it is subsequently going to be shed over the next 1 -3 months. This phenonmena of sudden increase in shedding is known as telogen effluvium.Recovery is spontaneous as the resting hair follicle re-enters anagen Or growth phase and this may take another 3-6 months.There is no specific treatment for telogen effluvium except for counselling about the natural history and spontaneous recovery in 3-6 months.It is advisable to take a good healthy nutritious diet rich in proteins and other nutrients during the recovery phase.Regards"},{"Patient":"i am 24 years old male........as i getting severe hair fall for 6 years.......my doctor prescribed me to use mintop10 and some vitamin tablets.......it will cause any side effects whether i will  face any remaining  hair loss if i stop using it suddenly.......","Doctor":"Hello.

Thank you for writing to us.You seem to have androgenetic alopecia, which is hereditary i.e often there is a family history.Minoxidil and finasteride are approved medications for this type of hair loss in males.Treatment may take 3-6 months for a noticeable improvement, therefore I suggest you to continue with the same treatment and give a fair trial of at least 6 months before deciding on its efficacy.Response may however vary between individuals and is partly determined by how early into androgenetic alopecia therapy is started.The goal of medical treatment is to arrest Or slow down further progression, therefore, earlier the therapy is begun the better it is.Minoxidil should be applied twice daily on absolutely clean and dry scalp, with the help of a dropper. Application is started from the center of scalp and gradually moving outwards.Hair oil should be avoided while on treatment with minoxidil.Finasteride is given as a single oral dose, once daily, before or after meals.Regards"},{"Patient":"hello doctor am karthik am facing problem from hair loss and too much dandruff which was oily and my hair is losing in a pattern from front side can u suggest me to restore my hair lost and to reduce dandrufff.   my friends told that if we use helmet then hair loss will be increased how much is it true can any one give me","Doctor":"Hi,You seem to have seborrheic dermatitis on scalp.

Thank you for writing to usYou seem to have androgenetic alopecia.This type of hair loss mainly affects the frontal part and crown part of the scalp.Hair loss is also associated with receding anterior hair line and widening and deepening of angles of anterior hair line.The goal of medical treatment with minoxidil and finasteride is mainly arresting Or slowing down the progression of hair loss therefore the earlier the therapy is initiated the better it is.Hair transplantation is an option if your anterior hair line and the hair line above temples have receded.Hair follicles would be harvested from the back of scalp and transplanted to reconstruct the anterior hair line.Cost of hair transplant would vary from doctor to doctor and is usually calculated based upon the number of hair follicles that are required to be harvested.It might cost you anywhere between USD 850 to USD 1500 depending on the number of hair follicles that need to be transplanted.Besides hair transplant you would be required to continue with minoxidil and finasteride to prevent further progression of hair loss.I suggest that you visit either a dermatologist or a plastic surgeon in your vicinity.Your doctor will be able to visually assess the degree and pattern of hair loss and then decide on the cost of hair transplant.You can also upload images of your scalp depicting the pattern and severity of hair loss and contact one of doctors on this forum, either a dermatologist or a plastic surgeon.Regards"},{"Patient":"sir I'm M Roy from india , m 23 years old.I losing my  hair during last 3 years, as s result the density of hair on middle portion of my head.

Lather it well in to the scalp and allow it to act for at least 5-10 minutes before rinsing it off.Dandruff/ seborrheic dermatitis is a steroid responsive condition and would respond remarkably to topical steroids lotion.Since you have stubborn dandruff therefore there is a scope to add a topical steroid lotion once daily at night for initial 2 weeks of treatment.Topical steroid lotions can be discontinued once there is significant improvement i.e  usually within 2 weeks.Thereafter the improvement can be sustained with anti-dandruff shampoo, used twice weekly for maintenance.The tablet that you have been prescribed contains biotin as the main active ingredient.Oral biotin helps in reducing hair fall and it can be continued.

Thank you for writing to usDandruff or seborrheic dermatitis is an important cause of increased hair shedding.Dandruff is more common in those who have oily scalp as a result of sebaceous over activity along with overgrowth of a fungus/ yeast known as malassezia furfur.In my patients I usually suggest a ketoconazole based antidandruff shampoo, every alternate days Or even daily.Ketoconazole is antiseborrheic and antifungal, therefore, is of benefit in mild to moderate seborrheic dermatitis.Nizoral is a ketoconazole based shampoo and is available OTC. It is marketed by Johnson & Johnson.Lather it well on your scalp and allow it to act for 5-7 minutes before rinsing it off.In some cases, dandruff is stubborn and an antidandruff shampoo alone seems insufficient in providing complete relief.In such stubborn cases I usually ask my patients to use a topical potent steroid lotion (e.g either mometasone furoate 0.1% lotion Or clobetasol propionate 0.05% lotion with or withour salicylic acid), twice daily at the scalp skin.Seborrheic dermatitis is a steroid responsive dermatoses and therefore topical steroids bring about rapid improvement, usually within days.Topical steroid lotions are prescription products.With topical steroids remarkable improvement is usually achieved, within 2 -4 weeks. Thereafter they can be discontinued.Since dandruff is bound to recur, therefore, rather than using a regular shampoo, patients who have dandruff may use a regular ketoconazole antidandruff shampoo to keep dandruff under check.You may first try an OTC Ketoconazole based shampoo, and use it every alternate days.It that seems insufficient you may visit a dermatologist in your region for further interventions e.g prescription topical steroids.Hope this information helpsRegards"},{"Patient":"sudden hair loss. female,age 26, weight 120 lbs.

Thank you for writing to usI suggest a possibility of Telogen effluvium, increased hair shedding being part of the stressful response to anemia.Hemolytic anemia causes transition of hair follicles from anagen/ growth phase to Telogen/ resting phase of hair growth cycle. Once hair enters Telogen phase it is subsequently shed.Telogen usually begins 1-3 months following a stressful event (hemolytic anemia in this case) and may last for 3-6 months following which hair re-enters growth phase/ anagen.Since she is on recovery path now and is on treatment with oral steroids for hemolytic anemia, therefore with time her hair fall would stop.Apart from a healthy nutricious diet I suggest that you add an Iron supplement and a Biotin supplement which would aid in faster recovery.These are prescription drugs therefore I suggest that you should visit a dermatologist in your vicinity for the needful.Regards"},{"Patient":"I recently had a missed miscarriage at 12.5wks.

This is most common cause of hair fall and decreased hair density/ thinning in males.Androgenetic alopecia may start at any time after puberty and usually manifests initially as widening and deepening of angles of anterior hair line in males.Later on there may be thinning, hair fall from the front and vertex part of the scalp along with receding anterior hair line.Treatment that is approved is topical minoxidil and oral finasteride.The tablet that you have been prescribed contains saw palmetto extract which has the same mechanism of action as finasteride.Therefore, in my view, you are on the right treatment for your alopecia.Goal of treatment is to arrest or slow down further progression & therefore it is important to start treatment as soon as possible.New hair regrowth depends on how early treatment was begun.

Telogen effluvium on the other hand is due to shifting of hair follicle from anagen(growth phase) to telogen (shedding phase). Once hair enters teolgen it will be shed over the next 2-3 months.Various triggering factors responsible for shifting hair from anagen to telogen are either dietary like deficient Iron stores; preceding illness like dengue, malaria, jaundice; preceding surgery; post-partum etc.Treatment would vary depending on the diagnosis.

I can observe that hair loss reduced little bit and when can i expect the hair regrowth? Can i use Tugain 5 lotion for few more months to stop the hair loss? Thanks in advance","Doctor":"Hello. Thank you for writing to us at healthcaremagicYou seem to have androgenetic alopecia. You have been asked to use topical minoxidil and oral finasteride.Both, minoxidil and finasteride are approved remedies for androgenetic alopecia.Minoxidil should be applied on absolutely clean scalp. Therefore, you may use coconut oil for just 2 hours before shampoo.It is important to shampoo daily while you are treating for androgenetic alopecia.Johnsons baby shampoo is fine. It is gentle and quite good for regular use. Ideally a shampoo should have pH value equivalent to skin i.e neutral or slightly acidic. High pH shampoo are harsh and can cause dryness.Treatment for androgenetic alopecia is long term and results vary from individual to individual.Results are usually noticeable after 3-6 months. The goal of treatment is to arrest and slow down progression of hair loss.New hair growth can be expected if the condition is not a long standing one.I suggest you to continue with the treatment and follow up with your treating doctor every 3 months.Regards"},{"Patient":"Hello Doctor, I have lost lot of hair on my crown, now my scalp is easily visible. My problem is not hereditary, everyone in my family has good dense hair. I am 28 and getting married in next 3 months. I am planning to take REVILUS tablets, eat Walnuts everyday and apply a Walnut oil or Saw Palmetto oil on the affected area regularly. Will this help?","Doctor":"Hello. Thank you for writing to us at healthcaremagicAfter going through your query I suggest a possibility of androgenetic alopecia.Hair loss in androgenetic alopecia mainly affects the front and crown part of the scalp.There may also be gradual recession of anterior hair line and widening and deepening of angles of anterior hair line.Family history is positive in most, however, absence of family history in close relatives like father, brother does not exclude this possibility.Presence of family history in uncles, nephews and cousins is also significant.Specific treatment for androgenetic alopecia includes topical minoxidil and oral finasteride.The goal of treatment is to arrest further progression therefore it is important to begin therapy as soon as possible.The tablet you are inquiring about is a biotin supplement.While it would help in supporting hair regrowth but itself it would not be sufficient in addressing the problem.You may nevertheless take this tablet along with specific treatment for androgenetic alopecia.I suggest that you visit a dermatologist for a confirmatory diagnosis as well as appropriate prescription.Regards"},{"Patient":"I am 36 yrs old .i am married before 6 year comlete this feb. i wasdone several medical test .report become nomal.i am take a lot of a medicine.as a.fertyl only 5, reguler fertibex , pantoplex, evecare, allos.duoleton 10days , m2 tone syrup ,is this priscription is right? is there any chances for me to get pregnent this month. my period are normal 28 days. plz advised me","Doctor":"Hi, you are taking right medicines.

Thank you for writing to us at healthcaremagicHair fall can be due to multiple causes. Masturbation has no role whatsoever in increasing hair fall.Common causes being androgenetic alopecia and telogen effluvium.Family history is of importance in androgenetic alopecia.Presence of family history in uncles, nephews and cousins is also significant and therefore absence of family history in first degree relatives like father and brother does not rule out androgenetic alopecia.Telogen effluvium on the other hand is due to shift of hair follicle from anagen(growth phase) to telogen (shedding phase). Once hair enters teolgen it will be shed over the next 2-3 months.Various triggering factors for shifting hair from anagen to telogen are either dietary like deficient Iron stores; preceding illness like dengue, malaria, jaundice; preceding surgery; post-partum etc.Treatment would vary depending on the diagnosis. Treatment options include topical minoxidil and Oral finasteride for androgenetic alopecia and topical minoxidil along with biotin supplement for telogen effluium.I suggest that you seek an appointment with a dermatologist in your region for the needful.Regards"},{"Patient":"hello, i have been facing severe problem of hair loss for past two three months.

It may be due to some cause. Most common cause is psychological upsets like anxiety,worries, tension or depression. Other causes may be thyroid dysfunction, vitamin and mineral deficiencies, anaemia, other internal diseases,drugs..etc. and you have thyroid dysfunction which might be responsible in your case.And remember that normal hair fall in adult may be 100 to 150 per day. So, please avoid anxiety related with hair fall.You consult dermatologist for firm diagnosis and treatment. Blood tests may be done to rule out internal diseases.You may take biotin containing tablets for long time along with vitamin E cap. You may apply mild steroid lotion like beclomethasone lotion on scalp at night. Mild herbal shampoo and almond oil may be used. Have patience for the result.

Thank you for writing to us at healthcaremagicStraightening / hair relaxers can make hair shaft weaker and thus lead to hair fall, specially if hair is subjected to repeated straightening, however, it is unlikely to last for 7 months after the procedure.Hair fall is commonly due to either telogen effluvium Or androgenetic alopecia.Telogen is resting phase of hair follicle; once  hair enters telogen it is going to be shed subsequently over the next 2-3 months.Causes of telogen are dietary deficiency/ deficient Iron stores; thyroid abnormalities; preceding stress e.g medical illness like dengue, jaundice, surgery etc; Or after delivery in females.After hair is shed, hair follicle again re-enters anagen / growth phase.Androgenetic alopecia, on the other hand is due to shortening of anagen phase of hair growth cycle producing progressively fewer and finer anagen hairs/ miniaturization.The product that you have been using contains topical minoxidil.Minoxidil is an excellent hair growth promoter and it stimulates transition of hair follicle from telogen to anagen as well as prolongs anagen.Therefore it is an excellent remedy against hair fall, however, the results may be slow and only noticeable after 3-6 months of regular use.Therefore, I suggest you to continue with minoxidil for the time being.You may also add an Oral Biotin supplement once daily. Biotin acts as an adjuvant to hair growth.Regards"},{"Patient":"HELLO DOCTOR I'M SIVA I HAVE BEEN AFFECTING HAIR LOSING AND SHIN PROBLEM SURROUND IN MY NECK SOME TIME I FEEL MORE DISTURBANCE WHILE I'M WORKING IN MY OFFICE SO PLS GIVE ANY REMEDIES TO CURE THIS PROBLEM AND ALSO TELL ME THE SOLUTION FOR THIS.

I would recommend you a short course of oral antifungal drugs like ketoconazole/itraconazole and a lotion containing clotrimazole and betamethasone twice a day over scalp for few weeks. Use a medicated shampoo containing ketoconazole and salicylic acid twice a week. Take antihistaminics as required for itching. Avoid excessive use of hair oil.As for the hairfall, start oral supplements containing biotin and other essential vitamins and minerals (Follihair new) once a day for atleast 3 months.Greying of hair occurs when the melanin of a particular hair follicle is permanently exhausted.Premature greying of hair is attributed to many factors like diet,nutrition, UV rays, pollution, cosmetics/dyes/colors, genetics, medications etc.Treatment of grey hair is pretty challenging. I would advise you biotin and calcium pantothenate combination tablets for atleast 6-8 months. Apply Altris gel containing Melitane, which is a new compound shown good results in premature greying of hair. Also, a novel hair sunscreen cum hair serum Q sera black has shown good results in preventation of hair damage from sun and pollution.Take plenty of fresh fruits and vegetables in your diet and try to de-stress your lifestyle. Try to limit your smoking and alcohol intake. Hope you get well soonDr Hardik Pitroda"},{"Patient":"i am 25yrs old female, 5'4, 58kg.

Hair fall is usually ascribed to multiple factors like diet and nutrition, hormones, stress, acute or chronic medical conditions,drugs,cosmetic products etc.From your description, it seems you might be having early stage of female pattern hair loss which is due to your hormones or tractional alopecia from constant pull/force on hair due to particular hairstyle.If i were your dermatologist/trichologist, i would like to take through history including family history, history of recent major trauma/illness/stress/medications etc, your menstrual history and recommend some basic investigations like CBC,blood sugar,Thyroid function test.I would suggest you a course of oral tablets containing biotin and other essential vitamins and minerals for minimum 3 months. Also, would put you on solution containing 5% minoxidil once a day and a hair serum containing peptides for hair growth at night.(Q sera etc).

I am not using any hair oil from last 1 month since I am using Mintop 5. What should I do? Also Can I use any hair oil like almond or any one you suggest and when should I apply it after applying mintop 5.","Doctor":"Hello. Thank you for writing to us at healthcaremagicYou seem to have androgenetic alopecia. One month of time is too short for any significant improvement.The increase in hair fall too is not much of a worry once you understand the reason for it.Minoxidil is a non-specific hair growth promoter and it causes hair follicle to shift from telogen (resting phase) to anagen (growth phase).Tthe new hair that grows (anagen) pushes out resting hair (telogen hair) and this manifests as increased shedding during initial part of treatment with minoxidil.This is actually a good sign because it means a shift from resting phase to growth phase.This increased shedding usually subsides in 2-4 weeks.Apart from topical minoxidil I will also suggest an oral anti-androgen e.g finasteride, once daily.Finasteride reverses and slows down progression of hair loss in androgenetic alopecia.Hair oil has no role whatsoever in treatment of androgenetic alopecia and should not be used while on treatment with minoxidil.However, if desired you may use hair oil for just 2-3 hours before a head bath.Regards"},{"Patient":"Hi Doctor, I am 27 yrs old having tremendous hair fall problem and hence it started baldness though it is in our heridity. I heard about mintop forte from my friend. Can it help me to solve my problem. I have my marriage day 3 months later. Please suggest.","Doctor":"Hello. Thank you for writing to us at healthcaremagicMost likely you have a condition known as androgenetic alopecia. Family history of baldness is suggestive.Androgenetic alopecia is gradual and causes thinning and hair fall mainly from the front and vertex part of the scalp.There may also be widening and deepening of angles of anterior hair line and gradual recession of anterior hair line.Minoxidil and finasteride are approved for treatment of androgenetic alopecia.Treatment is long term. The goal of treatment is to arrest or slow down further progression.Therefore treatment should be started early before hair loss has progressed to later stages.Though the topical solution that you heard from your friend contains minoxidil, however, I suggest you to visit a dermatologist for a confirmatory diagnosis and appropriate prescription rather than using a treatment on your friends advice.Moreover minoxidil alone won't solve your problem. Finasteride together with minoxidil is more effective than using minoxidil alone.Regards"},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, i am 28 year old male, suffering from hair loss for last 5 years. i don't have any family history of hair fall and all family members has good hairs. untill 2 years back i took homeopathic treatment for hair fall, it slowed down my hair fall but didn't stopped it.

Thank you for writing to us at healthcaremagicSudden/ acute hair fall is known as Telogen Effluvium.Telogen is the resting phase of hair growth cycle and once hair enters Telogen, it is shed over the next few days.There may be various causes for transition to telogen phase. Most of these causes are identifiable in the history of the patient, in the preceding 3-4 months before onset of Telogen.Telogen usually begins 2-3 months after a stressful event/ triggering event. This stressful event can be a preceding medical illness like e.g dengue, malaria, jaundice etc; a major surgery is also usually followed by telogen that begins 3-4 months after the stressful event.Other common causes are deficient Iron stores; Weight loss/ dieting; post pregnancy/ post partum, certain drugs etc.These causes if identified can be addressed appropriately.Telogen usually lasts 3-6 months and hair loss recovers if the inciting factor is identified and removed.I usually ask my patients to take a good healthy diet rich in nutrients, vitamins and minerals.An Iron supplement may be added over the next 4-6 months as Iron stores are a common cause of hair fall in females.A Biotin supplement is also beneficial for hair. Biotin helps in recovery and is essential in the synthesis of protein that builds hair.I suggest you to visit a dermatologist for a confirmatory diagnosis as well as appropriate treatment.Topical minoxidil solution/ liquid may also be started by your treating dermatologist and is quite useful in cutting short telogen effluvium.Regards"},{"Patient":"I'm suffering from the disease alopeciaAnd all my body hair fell from about 5 yearsCorticosteroids have been used for several sessions and suspended himI am 25 years oldAnd 160 linearWeight 52I hope to visit any specialist in any place in India for treatmentI am from Saudi Arabia","Doctor":"hi, welcome to HCM,you are suffering from alopecia universalis.as a treating dermatologist i used steroid mini pulse. potent steroid (Halobetasol lotion) for topical application. minoxidil 5% once daily for local application. tab biotin 10mg + PABA + ca pantothenate once daily.most importantly i rely on intra lesional injection of triamcenolone acetonide in sessions.this gives very good result.thanks."},{"Patient":"Madam, my name is sudha.

Take plenty of fresh fruits and vegetables in your diet and try to de-stress your routine life.Hope your queries are resolved and wish you best of health.Thank youDr Hardik Pitroda"},{"Patient":"I have these white hard tiny beads all over my scalp and I am having ALOT of hair loss its more like shedding but to the point where everyone points out im loosing my hair.

It may be reduced by nutrient deficiency (i.e., anorexia, anemia, zinc deficiency) and hormonal fluctuations (i.e., menopause, polycystic ovaries, thyroid disease).Essential omega-3 fatty acids, protein, vitamin B12, and iron, prevent a dry scalp and dull hair color. vitamins A and C, which help with production of sebum and provide a natural hair conditioner. Protein promote hair growth. Biotin functions to activate certain enzymes that aid in metabolism of carbon dioxide as well as protein, fats, and carbohydrates.

Thank you for writing to us at healthcaremagicDandruff Or seborrheic dermatitis is a common cause of increased hair shedding.I suggest you to use a ketoconazole based antidandruff shampoo, every alternate days for 2-4 weeks.Nizoral is an OTC ketoconazole based shampoo and you may use it every alternate days. Lather it well and leave it on for 5 minutes before rinsing it off.If this seems insufficient or inadequate, you may consult a dermatologist.Dandruff or Seborrheic dermatitis is steroid responsive. Therefore, dandruff that is resistant to treatment with antidandruff shampoo is best treated with topical steroid lotions e.g clobetasol propionate or mometasone furoate lotion, initially for 2-4 weeks.Thereafter the Improvement can be sustained with regular antidandruff shampoos.Regards"},{"Patient":"hello sir,myself ml.a.of age 25yrs.

Thank you for writing to us at healthcaremagicI will keep a possibility of female pattern androgenetic alopecia (FAGA) Or herditary hair loss.In your case the hair loss due to FAGA may have been unmasked by post-partum hair loss Or telogen effluvium as commonly happens in most of the individuals.In FAGA, hair loss is mainly from the front and crown part of the scalp. This hair loss is also associated with thinning of hair.Together all these factor combine to greatly diminish hair volume so that the patient is usually concerned about hair.If I was the treating doctor I would have suggested you to use topical minoxidil 2% solution, twice daily.Minoxidil is US FDA approved for androgenetic hair loss in females.Besides, I would also suggest an Oral Biotin supplement and an Oral Iron supplement once daily.Biotin is good for hair and it supports growth as well as improves quality of hair.Deficiency of Iron stores (as determoned by serum ferritin levels) is the most common cause of diffuse hair fall in females(telogen). Adding it would stop and prevent hair loss due to Iron deficiency.Besides all these measures, a good healthy wholesome diet, rich in proteins, nutrients and minerals is also good for healthy hair.Regards"},{"Patient":"sir, im 21 yrs old nd suffering frm hair loss since 4-5 yrs..but now im using hair 4u 10percent along with curlzfin tablets...but im nt getting any results rather my harfall is incrising..im putting hair 4u in night nd when in morning i m combing my hair the sight is horrible....very high amount of hair sticks into the comb..nd the no. of times i comb my hair that many times i lose my har approx. to 30 in nos. please sujjest me as to what shall i do....i will be grateful to u........","Doctor":"thanks for asking,first of all keep in mind that 100 no of hair fall per day is normal.secondly the result of medication you are taking takes time 3-8mth.it takes 3 mth to stop hair fall and further 3-6 mth to regrow terminal hair.add tab finesteride 1mg daily, one volumizing shampoo(X-gain lotion). add capixyl(a new molecule) once daily - bioexidil serum/grocapix gel."},{"Patient":"i have been suffering from severe hair loss prb since last 1 yr.

Thank you for writing to us at healthcareMagicThe lotion that you intend to use contains Minoxidil which is a hair growth promoter.Minoxidil induces transition of hair follicle from the telogen (resting phase) to anagen phase (growth phase).Minoxidil is approved for treatment of androgenetic alopecia. It induces new hair growth. However, minoxidil won't affect the thickness of hair.The capsules that you mention contain saw palmetto extract which is an inhibitor of enzyme 5 alpha reductase; this enzyme is present in hair follicles and catalyzes the conversion of testosterone to dihydrotestosterone, the main culprit that it involved in the miniaturization of hair follicles thus leading to hair thinning.Finasteride has the same mechanism of action as saw palmetto extract.

Thank you for writing to us at healthcaremagicYou seem to have Androgenetic Alopecia. I don't think shaving has a role to play in inducing it. It has just unmasked it.In this type of hair loss, there is hair thinning (miniaturization) and gradual reduction in density of hair from the top of the scalp.There is also similar involvement of angles of the anterior hair line, which become wider and deeper, giving a \\"V\\" shaped appearance to the anterior hair line.Minoxidil and Finasteride are approved remedies for this type of hair loss. Treatment is long term and the earlier it is started the better it is because it is easier to stall further progression of hair loss in Androgenetic Alopecia than to regrow new hair.These are prescription medications, I suggest you to talk to your dermatologist for the needful.Concomitant dandruff also needs to be managed effectively. I will also suggest you to use a ketocoanzole based shampoo for dandruff.Nizoral is Ketoconazole based antidandruff shampoo and is available OTC.Regards"},{"Patient":"Hello I have moved to Dubai and am experiencing hair fall/breakage. I used to have mild alopecia when I was in my early teens (i am currently 23) so i went to a doctor here. They did blood tests to see if I had a thyroid issue but the results were all normal. Likewise i do not have low iron and there is no history of it in my family. What could this be caused by?

Fortunately i was able to fall pregnent with no medical assistance. and again after about 8 months of trying with my 3 yrs old. i have been trying for  the past 12 months to fall pregnant again with no luck. I have Hypothyroidism and taking 10o micrograms daily since i was about 12yrs old. i have been taking my temp and checking the position of my cervix as i find it very difficult to know when im ovulating. i have very painful cramps around when i think im ovulating, but often not backed up with egg white mucous. my periods have been regular 28 day cycles since my 3 year old was born, up until the past 3 months, which have started to be out by a 4-7 days late. this month i didnt get my period for 48 days. i had had intercouse a week before i got period on day 41 and had severe pain to the point i was going to go to the hospital. it did subside the next day after taking some pain killers. i saw my GP who sent me for an ultrasound. the results were: uterus is in anteverted position with bulky appearance, measuring 95cc. Myometrium is heterogeneous. Endometrium appears unremarkable, measuring 12mm. Right ovary, there is a 1.8 x 1.7cm thick walled hypoechoic structure with internal echoes. no abnormal vascularity demonstrated. left ovary appears in remarkable, measuring 7cc, right ovary measures 12cc. I have had all the usual blood test, hcg, prolactin, progesterone, testosterone, thyroid, shg. all have come back within normal range. I am unsure what this all means. Will this make it harder for me to fall pregnant? should i even try? would this cause complications if i was to fall pregnant? Regards Lisa","Doctor":"Hi there, I have understood your concern . I will suggest you the best possible treatment options. First of all do not panic. Please consider that you have already been able to get pregnant twice.  Please keep taking your thyroid treatment meticulously, monitor TSH levels every 3 months. For your PCOS, I will suggest you to opt for a healthy diet and regular exercise regimen. Try to have optimum weight,  with vody mass index od 23. Avoid deep fried foods, bakery products and refined sugars. Avoid substance abuse if any. Start on Folic acid, Vitamin B 12 and Omega 3 supplements at least 3 months before you plan to get pregnant. This helps to prevent many problems during pregnancy and delivery. As your remaining reports are normal , you need not worry about getting pregnant. You can simply get USG done for follicle study, to know the day of ovulation. accordingly you can have unprotected sex act, or IUI on the day of ovulation. I hope this answer helps you. Thanks.

Thanks in Advance Vishvendra Singh","Doctor":"Hello. Thank you for writing to us at healthcaremagicDandruff is certainly one of the cause of increased hair shedding but there can be other concomitant factors too responsible for hair fall in males e.g androgenetic alopecia is the most common cause of hair fall and thinning in males and could be a possibility in you as well.Treatment of androgenetic alopecia is with topical minoxidil and oral antiandrogens like finasteride.Therefore, I suggest you to visit a dermatologist for a visual assessment of the extent and reasons for hair fall and appropriate prescriptionDandruff is recurrent. Antidandruff shampoo are advisable to be used regularly in those who have dandruff. They can be used either every alternate days Or even daily depending on the severity of dandruff. Once significant Improvement has been achieved it can be maintained with twice weekly antidandruff shampoo.OTC antidandruff shampoo may not be totally effective and therefore you may require a prescription antidandruff shampoo for better results e.g those which contain newer antifungals like climbazole, piroctone olamine and ciclopirox olamine are far effective than OTC shampoos and may be tried. They are also available as overnight leave on preparations. Overnight leave-on preparations being more effective because of the longer contact time.Another option in patients with resistant dandruff is to use a moderately potent topical steroid e.g mometasone furoate lotion at scalp skin overnight along with an antidandruff shampoo.Seborrheic dermatitis is a steroid responsive dermatosis and therefore topical steroid lotions bring about a remarkable improvement in about 2 weeks when they can be discontinued and the improvement maintained with just antidandruff shampoo.I suggest that you visit a dermatologist for more details regarding dandruff, androgenetic alopecia and appropriate treatment.Regards"},{"Patient":"I had done MTP when i got pregnant for the 1st month. i did MTP in months time. now i am trying to get pregnant again from past 12months but not getting successful. i underwent mtp on 14 oct 2009.

Thank you for writing to usPlatelet rich plasma therapy Or PRP is a recent advancement in the treatment of hair loss and alopecia.The principle behind using it is that human platelet are a rich source of growth factors and these platelet derived growth factors have a stimulatory effect on hair follicles and help in arresting hair fall as well as regrow new hair.This therapy utilizes patients own blood which is double centrifuged to separate and then further concentrate platelet fraction.This platelet fraction is then injected into the affected area where platelet derived growth factors are released directly into the tissue.This treatment has been mainly tried in androgenetic alopecia but recently even in alopecia areata as well; its use has been reported in the literature with good results.A session of PRP is recommended once every 2-3 months for a total of 3-4 sessions.Results are long lasting and durable but they need to be maintained either with maintenance sessions of PRP or combining it with with other treatment modalities.It can be combined with other treatment modalities like minoxidil.The cost of treatment varies from doctor to doctor and you must ask your local doctors for the same.Regards"},{"Patient":"hii..i am a 23 year old female..i had very dense hair..but one year back i got posted in chennai..since then i have had tremendous hair loss...its soo bad that im almost turning bald..im having a good diet..which included fruits n veggies everyday..plus food rich in calcium n protien n iron..i also oil my hair twice in a week..still i have immense hair fall..please suggest ..","Doctor":"HIWell come to HCMUnderlying cause of this is important here, this could be fungal infection dandruff, hormone imbalanced, stress, and condition need to be treated accordingly till then you can try Minoxidil lotion 5% apply this twice in day rule out the possibility of chronic illness too, hope this information helps, have a nice day."},{"Patient":"I am Aruna, 24 age.

Thanks for writing to us at healthcaremagic.In dandruff Or Seborrheic Dermatitis, there is an overgrowth of yeast, Malassezia furfur. This yeast has been implicated in dandruff.Dandruff is a common cause of increased hair shedding. Controlling dandruff effectively would control excessive hair fall too.Various antifungal agents (e.g ketoconazole, sertaconazole, ciclopirox olamine, piroctone olamine) are available either as shampoo or as overnight leave-on lotions, for dandruff.You may try using an OTC antifungal shampoo e.g Nizoral shampoo (contains ketoconazole), every alternate days.However, in some cases shampoo alone may not be totally effective. In such cases, along with the antidandruff shampoo, I usually ask my patients to use a topical steroid lotion (Mometasone furoate Or Clobetasol propionate lotion) once daily at night for a short period of 2 weeks Or i might switch them to an overnight leave-on antidandruff preparation.Seborrheic dermatitis is a steroid responsive condition, therefore, topical steroids are usually effective in this condition. Topical steroid lotions are prescription products.A two weeks course of topical steroids brings about remarkable improvement, which can then be maintained with just an anti-dandruff shampoo, every alternate days.However, if your dandruff does not respond as desired by OTC shampoo, you may visit a dermatologist in your region. Your dermatologist might choose to prescribe a topical steroid lotion for a short duration of 2-4 weeks.Your dermatologist may also want to switch to a different antifungal shampoo Or choose to prescribe an overnight leave-on antidandruff lotion.Regards"},{"Patient":"i Have hair fall problem...hi i am siva from France.. i am 25 yrs old. for the last one year i have hair fall problem. i lost my hair and i look like little old.. i dont know why it happens.. i consult the doctor. he prescribe à médical shampoo but it doesnt stop. can you give me some advice...","Doctor":"Hello,Thank you for posting on HCM.I appreciate your concern regarding hair fall.
