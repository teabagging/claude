Good morning. I am Dr Shareef answering your query. Once any lump is painful, it has to be inflamed/secondarily infected.

Good morning. I am Dr Shareef answering your query.With your history, it is typical of a sebaceous cyst with a black dot on it, which discharges a smelly cheesy material on squeezing. This is a benign cyst without any fear of turning into a malignancy. However, to prevent other complications like recurrent infections, abscess formation, it is advisable to get it operated and send it for a histo-pathological study to confirm the diagnosis. If I were your doctor, I would refer you to a general surgeon who after examining you physically and a preoperative check up, might advise you to get it operated soon.I hope this information would help you in discussing with your family physician/treating doctor in further management of your problem.

I am 62 years old.","Doctor":"Hello!Thank you for the query.If it will be removed with small margin of healthy tissues, no regrow should appear. As it is black, it may be a mole or cyst with a mole.

So removal will be the best and final treatment. After it, you should forgot about this lump and live your life.Hope this will help.Regards."},{"Patient":"My 8 year old son has 2 lumps on his head that are causing discomfort.

I am Dr Shareef answering your query.With your history this seems to be a resolving hematoma in the subcutaneous tissues of the area. As the hematoma was large enough initially, it might take more time for the blood to get absorbed gradually. You can apply a pressure bandage over it if need be. However, it would take its own time unless it has got organised. In that case it might have to be evacuated by a small incision under local anaesthesia.

Chest CT results indicate enlarged heart, sac of fluid in right lung. Had a 102 fever 2 days ago but is now normal. Was under antibiotics, currently taking Lyrica for pain in head, prednisone increased to daily 60 mg. I realize he has a lot going on but am interested in any direction. Thank you.","Doctor":"Hi,Welcome, this is Dr Sameer, cardiologist.Enlarged heart can be because of lots of causes. Rheumatoid arthritis can be one of them. I'll recommend you to first get a 2D Echo done to know the exact abnormality of heart which will guide the treatment ahead. He will need extra medicines for the enlarged heart.Sac of fluid around the lung (pleural effusion) could be because of infection. If it is large enough, it may need removal by needle. If is not very large, than we just give medicine to control the infection, and with control of infection, this fluid sac will gradually resolve.Wishing him a quick recovery.ThanksTake care"},{"Patient":"hi i have a lump in my pubic region and its sore and only just come up about 2 days ago any ideas wat it could be and how to get rid of it? i kno its not an std or anything but thought maybe was ingrown hair n pulled all ones out around the sore area and still nothing???","Doctor":"Hi ! Good morning. I am Dr Shareef answering your query.The sore lump in the pubic region could be due to a infection any way immaterial of an STD or otherwise.

If it does not, then you might have to consult a general surgeon to rule out any chances of a continuing accumulation of blood, or an organised hematoma, which might require some kind of intervention. The hematoma might reduce with aspiration and a pressure bandage for the present, but one can not rule out recurrent accumulation of blood in it. Therefore, it would be better not to do any invasive procedure on it without any definite medical indication. I would rather suggest you to get it clinically examined by a general surgeon in your area for proper management.I hope this information would help you in discussing with your family physician/treating doctor in further management of your problem. Please do not hesitate to ask in case of any further doubts.Thanks for choosing health care magic to clear doubts on your health problems. Wishing you an early recovery. Dr Shareef."},{"Patient":"My son has had several lumps appear on his head.

I am a female.  I had pain in my groin today and it felt a little bruised.  In the shower I checked out the pain and noticed I have a lump right next to the bulbocavernosus muscles or whatever muscle that runs along each side of my vaginal opening.  It is hard and maybe just smaller than a marble.  it is deep but at the same time I was able to feel it pretty close to the skin.  I don't think it is a boil or staph.  I have had a boil before and it feels nothing like that.  I noticed that I have had this pain before when my fiance was being intimate with me and it has been there since I gave birth to my 3 year old.  As soon as I start getting aroused I would get this same exact pain but the pain is more intense at this time.  The pain would go away after a few minutes and I was able to continue being intimate with my fiance'.  This time the pain is happening on its own and I promise that I'm not \\"arroused\\" at this moment.The lump (if you are me) is on my left side not quite to the perinium but closer to the perinium than to my urethra.  The pain is continuous today.  On a scale of 1-10 it is probably a 3.

I would advise such a patient to undergo ultrasonography or preferably CT scan so that the cause can be determined.

There may also be an area of thrombosis of the vein with the vein feeling hardened to touch. The inflammation will cause itching. Your symptoms do not indicate a serious problem. To ease the itching you could try a cool pack to the area. I would expect the itching to reduce over the next few days.

This is a small hole or tunnel in the skin. It usually develops in the cleft of the buttocks where the buttocks separate. When it becomes inflamed, it will cause pain. There is a risk it may become infected leading to an abscess. In your case, it is inflamed. I suggest you keep the area clean and dry. Take daily salt baths. Keep the area free of hair by shaving.

Clinic told me today I could have to wait 6 weeks","Doctor":"Hi,Thanks for writing to HCM .The main factor here is your age . If your age is less then 35yrs then less likely to have cancer. Other features which suggest lump could be  a cancer are -rapid growth of lump-skin over lump is puckered or fixed -hard and fixed lump-nipple abnormalities-bleeding from nipple -family history of breast cancer -small swellings in corresponding arm pit.I would suggest you to seek medical attention soon if any of the above feature you have.You can get FNAC done. This is aspiration from lump and its study. It is minor procedure just like giving injection. You can wait if your lump is freely mobile in breast and it is not hard and slow growing.I suggest you better get FNAC done instead of only relying of signs . Any pathologist will do FNAC. Hope I have been helpful .RegardsDr.Deepika  Patil"},{"Patient":"Primosa and evon 400has been prescribed to me as a fibrodenomas was detected in my breast. It bein cancereous nt yet detected.

There will be no formed swelling in breast. 2nd is fibroadenoma in which there will be well formed swelling which moves freely in breast and it will not be painfull. For fibroadenosis primrose and evion is usefull to treat it. For well formed fibroadenoma treatment is surgical removal. It won't reduce by you medication.At age of 26yrs it is very less likely to have cancer unless in your family you have many blood related females with breast cancer. Still if you have doubt you can get done FNAC . It is needle aspiration of swelling and it is examined to know whether it is cancer or not.Hope I have been helpful .RegardsDr.Deepika Patil"},{"Patient":"I am a 38 year old male, and have had multiple lumps under my left arm and left rib cage for quite a while.

I have my follow up on Monday.","Doctor":"Hi. You have correctly diagnosed, this is due to constant irritation from the pads. Many times this is self limiting , Keep a watch. You can apply liquid povidone iodine if you have . Good that you have appointment"},{"Patient":"Strange issue -- I keep skipping very random heart beats, followed by no chest pain but  constantly, daily, I seem to have sudden hard 'whacking' hard heart beats in my chest seemingly randomly. Is this an issue I should see a doctor for, even though my mother complains of having the same thing most of her life, however, not as frequent as myself?","Doctor":"Hi,Welcome, this is Dr Sameer, cardiologist.Skipped heart beat could be in form of premature ventricular contraction (PVC), which are premature contraction from a normal part of heart or could be more serious arrhythmia in form of Atrial Fibrillation.For the diagnosis, you need to do a ECG at the time of this skipped heart beat. If the duration of these skipped beats are short enough to reach a nearby hospital, we advice our patients for a 24 hr ECG monitoring called Holter Monitoring.The treatment will be as per the report of above tests. So get these tests done soon.ThanksTake care"},{"Patient":"I have discovered a pea sized lump on my inner right thigh a few days ago just doing a simple external physical on my own after a shower. Its painless and doesn t itch or show redness at all. I press it and its not painful. Should I be concerned or just keep watch on it? Im a man of 47yrs old. Overall health is good and don t smoke.","Doctor":"Hi. If this swelling is just under the skin, do not worry . You can wait and watch. This can be a simple sebaceous cyst or a lipoma."},{"Patient":"I have itchy bites (i think are bites) on thighs, lower abdomen and even some on my hands. My main concern though is the lumps on my scrotum, and also one on my shaft. My doctor has ruled out hpv or herpes when i originally showed him, but since then more have appeared, the original ones have gotten smaller but still itch when irritated. The lumps do not itch unless i scratch them first, and ttwo of them are probably one cm in diamter, the other two are now irregular shaped and probably half the size and the one on my shaft looks like a small pimple without a head to it. My foreskin also sort of has a itchy sensation to it, but not itchy enough that it forces me to scratch it.","Doctor":"Hi.Thanks for an elucidate history and findings. These are suggestive of scabies as the most probable diagnosis. Consult a Dermatologist for a proper diagnosis and management.."},{"Patient":"Hello-I have a lump the size of a ping pong ball on the medial side of the top of my calf just under the knee. It has been there for a while and I thought it was a muscle cramp from training. But I have been on vacation for three weeks and it has not reduced in size. It is not painful unless I press directly on it. What can it be and should I see a doctor for it?","Doctor":"Hi.The size of a ping-pong  ball is a big swelling and can be due to lipoma or a sebaceous cyst. You must visit a Surgeon to confirm What it is and to see if it is not related to your joint / synovial membrane. It is always better to get operated for two reasons- one - to get rid of the swelling and Second: get a tissue diagnosis so that the fear of a serious problem goes away."},{"Patient":"I have a lump on my shin only noticeable when in a crouched position. I also have. Very bad knee pain. Feels Lke kinda dull achy pain deep in my knee like I say my bones hurt because it radiates up my thigh bone and down my shin bone. Pain worse with prolonged standing","Doctor":"HI. The more important is the pain in the knee , which is radiating. This is suggestive of an active inflammatory process going on in the Knee and should be physically checked by an Orthopedic Surgeon and confirmed by an MRI of the knee joint.The other swelling can be due to a muscle herniation as it is seen only on a typical position. This too will be confirmed by your Ortho Surgeon and may need a few stitches to close the defect."},{"Patient":"Swollen lump on the vein at the intersection between my wrist and right hand. I may have bumped it or rubbed it working in a confined space on my car. No discoloration, but quite hard. Will it go away by itself? When do I need to seek medical attention?","Doctor":"HI.IF this swelling is moving with the movement of the fingers, it is connected with the tendons - can be tendosynovitis.- take Doctor's opinion and treatment.  If it is not moving and is on any of the veins ( just increase the pressure on the wrist by encircling  around it), do nothing . It will subside on its own. Do not play or fiddle with this."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor I am a 31 year old female, I have a pea sized, painless non moveable lump on the left side of my neck. It is not on my skin I can move my skin while the lump stats in place. I have had a full blood count which came back normal. What cld this be?","Doctor":"Hi. This could be a lymph node attached to the muscle and hence not movable.The best way to get a diagnosis is not the blood work; it is ultrasonography and FNAC= fine needle aspiration cytology that will give the diagnosis. Please go for this and you will get the perfect diagnosis. Another way is to get the excision biopsy."},{"Patient":"Celulitus several times in same leg.

Recently, bruising started around it, and it's a little bit painful when pushed.  It feels like the size of a pea, and is the consistency of a marble.  I'm a 35y/o active female.","Doctor":"HI.

This will remove the disease and you get a tissue diagnosis."},{"Patient":"Hi, I hit my head on a sharp object and now i have a lump on my head, i have a headache, and Im throwing up. Is there anything i can take to make this go away or what should i do. i know i should see a doctor but is there any other way to treat this without going to the doctor?","Doctor":"HI.Life is more important than anything else.

I ve been having some chest pains and I m generally worried about my heart and don t want to wait 2 weeks for the test. Can I go to an emergency room or urgent care to have one done right away?","Doctor":"Hi,Welcome, this is Dr Sameer, cardiologist.IHSS do follow a hereditary pattern and we advice such patients to be in regular follow up & do some tests. If your earlier tests have been fine, than it does not rule out possibility of having a heart issue in future.If you are having chest pain, I'll recommend you to go to the Emergency & at least do a ECG to see if anything is wrong.For your knowledge, cardiac pain is non localized (i.e. it is diffused) & increase on exertion (with exercise like walking, running or stress) & it is generally not relieved by traditional pain killers.So yes, get yourself evaluated soon.In future, despite of having a simple echocardiogram, I'll advice you for a stress echo, which helps better in predicting chances of future cardiac events.ThanksTake care"},{"Patient":"Hi, I am 19 years old and have just begun being sexually active.

Late last night he woke in agony and this morning it is swollen, bruised and with a lump on top of his wrist where his wrist bends...... Should I go back or is it just ligament damage?","Doctor":"Hi.You should go back to the doctor.Just a ligament injury is bad than the real fracture. It is difficult to diagnose and treat.

As such a large lump can take a long time to heal if it is on the hard palate ( bony part).This can be an abscess or infected minor salivary gland tumor and needs a special attention of a oral surgeon or ENT surgeon.Till you get an appointment- take very soft diet, pain-killers if you have."},{"Patient":"I have had a marble sized hard nodule on my neck for 24 years.  An oncologist checked it about 6 years ago and said that is was not a lymph node and it was nothing to be concerned about unless it started botherin me.

All of sudden the firm nodule gets larger, maybe not significant but large enough for me to notice and want to hide from others. What could this be? Some days the area around the marble seems puffy and then some days it not.  Also, I never remember it is there until I sleep wrong and it gets lodged under my jaw then it causes my jaw to go sleep or tingle for a few minutes.  If I poke on it for a while it will get sore but other than that I don't even know it is there. No other symptoms...no weight loss (just the opposite), no night sweats, nothing!","Doctor":"Hi.

All your symptoms are suggestive od a disease where there is an allergic problem. It is practically very difficult to find which factor/s cause such problems.It is always a permutation and combination and a keen observation that you can find the factors. You have to avoid all such factors away at any cost. The red itchy spots and yellow bumps near cheek bones can again due to the same factors. Try not to use betnovate ointment on the face, as this can make the skin thin permanently. No milk and milk products and try to find out which other protein products / food products / beverages and topical contact things cause.

Such patients could not just lye down straight & have breathlessness on doing so. If that is so, I'll recommend you to keep your bed propped up so that fluid does not accumulate in lungs.

Since it is 10 months, the only good answer is surgical removal as Artefill id not absorbable. There may be a little scar as scarification is the character the skin which is different in all the individuals. Ask you doctor whether the granuloma formation has occurred or the injection did not disperse, whether there was local reaction. If there was no local reaction further injections near the site of original injection can be filled to negate the effects of lump appearance. But make sure with your Doctor if he can do this. Another good way is injection of your own fat near the bumps to make a smoothness around them.  Your photograph could have helped us to tell you more since this is an aesthetic  part of practice.

Recently got much worse (painfully inflamed). Stopped using my anti-persperant/deodorant several days ago (and apologized to my co-workers :P) but today when I got home from work, it was leaking puss. Hot cloth, anti-bac soap, and a bit of painful squeezing and a plug of dried puss came out. Question: Once this has healed, should I just use a deodorant from now on? Could this be what has caused this (apparently) recurring problem? If it recurs, would it be advisable to see a doctor, or is it okay to treat it myself (I m pretty handy)... Thank you","Doctor":"Hello!Thank you for the query.Such recurring infection in this area are rather not caused by a deodorant. Deodorants usually cause allergic reaction, not a bacterial infection.Most probable reason of your problem is shaving in this area or diabetes. I suggest you to start with washing this area with soap and water before and after shaving. Try to use sterile shavers. In a meanwhile you should also have glucose level checked.If the problem will be coming back, I suggest you to consult dermatologist and have swab test of this area done.Hope this will help.Regards."},{"Patient":"I was camping on the weekend and Saturday late morning noticed a purple round mark on my neck that looked like broken blood vessels.

It is still very swollen and red 3 days later.","Doctor":"Hello!Thank you for the query.Pus presence clearly indicates an infection in this area. Such bump can be caused by a bug bite (as you have been camping recently).

Some antibiotics might be necessary to heal it.Hope this will help.Regards."},{"Patient":"Hi, I had a surgery done on a right hydrocele about a year ago, and recently the scar has developed a red lump under it.

It doesn't really hurt unless I put pressure on it.","Doctor":"Hello!Thank you for the query.A lump in the scar area after such long time usually indicates some tissues irritation due to stitches which were left under the skin. This stitches usually get absorbed after 2-3 months. However in some patients stitches can trigger inflammatory reaction. This results with lump creation.Other possibility is that your scar is growing and creating a keloid.Both conditions are not serious.

Injury is a very common factor of veins thrombosis. If you do smoke or take some hormonal pills (like contraceptives), the risk of thrombosis is higher.

Due to veins rupture during the injury, blood has accumulated in the soft tissues. This gives a lump which is usually painful. Please note that if the blood collection is large, wont go away by itself. Blood is a great source of nutrition for bacteria. So if its a blood collection, it will get infected sooner or later and will turn into abscess.I suggest you to consult a surgeon with it. Ultrasound should be done.

Hard lump usually indicates some inflammation. If there is a redness and pain in the lump area, some small abscess can be the reason.If it is only hard, but painless, it may be allergic reaction to some bite indeed.The best way is to consult dermatologist or surgeon with this lump.

During that 2 weeks the infection had spread down my leg and into my ankle and foot, so my leg from my knee down was swollen (huge), and red all over and burned really bad. It was very painful and couldn't even barely touch it without pain to worsen. The infection got really bad. Now after I'm done taking my antibiotics, my knee and leg is a lot better, but still has some internal swelling and I don't have full movement back in my knee. I can't bend it much, nor straighten it all the way and is still very tender inside just to use and outside to touch. The swelling on the outside appears to be mostly gone, except a few spots on my knee itself. I have also got a spot on my knee cap that is very hard and tender and looks to appear red, and or the look of a bruise. This is the spot it originated to start, before it spread. Can anyone tell me why I have a hard lump like spot on my knee like this after, if its normal, and if this will go away, or if it's something that might need taken care of? There's still some present issues from the infection and not sure if I need to be taking more antibiotics until its totally gone, or if it will just continuely get better from here.

Much appreciated!","Doctor":"Hi,Thanks for writing to HCM.You seem to have developed an abscess at the knee at the point of entry of infection.Or rather to say its more of an antibioma now with all the antibiotics you have taken.You need to show it to a surgeon and request him to put a needle there and aspirate to see exactly if pus is there.

Due to infection, puss appears and starts giving pain. If it lasts long enough, the lump starts to leak.I suggest you to consult a surgeon with this lump. It needs to be incised and removed. To make sure it wont recur, it needs to be removed with the capsule. Hope this will help.Regards."},{"Patient":"i have a small lump on my leg that is soft to touch its on my shin bone i did fall over a year ago and had acut above it that went quite sceptibut that has healed but this lump has appeared and hurts more when i run and also hurts if i put pressure on at any time thanks","Doctor":"Hello!Thank you for the query.In this location, the most probable reason is varicose vein due to veins insufficiency. Some kind of cyst is also possible if this lump is close to the joint. The best way to find out what exactly it is, is to perform an ultrasound of this area. If bone related lump is possible, also an x-ray should be done.Please consult a surgeon with this issue.Hope this will help.Regards."},{"Patient":"A hard lump has formed below the teeth along the outside of the jaw line, right by the pre-molars and molars. It was sore when first developed, but no longer causes any sort of pain, soreness, etc. It is totally hard to the touch, no swelling or movement.","Doctor":"Hello!Thank you for the query.Such lump can be caused by a stone in salivary glands which has moved to the salivary ducts. It is more possible if you have had pain when swallowing. If you do smoke, malignant lesions like mouth cancer or tongue cancer should be also considered.I suggest you to consult larynglogist with this issue. In case of stone, it needs to be incised and removed.Hope this will help.Regards."},{"Patient":"Hi i've had a lump on my neck that has been there for more than a year now. At first it was small and barely noticeable, but now it has more than doubled in size and is very red and painful. I do have alot of sinus congestion and I think it may have something to do with it. I am setting up a docots appointment asap.","Doctor":"Hello!Thank you for the query.Lump on the neck which has gotten bigger sounds like an enlarged lymph node. As it is painful, sinus infection can be a factor of it. Sometimes such lump can appear due to lymphoma, therefore you should not ignore it.Other skin lesions like sebacues cyst should be also considered.You are right consulting a doctor as soon as possible. Ultrasound of this area should be done. If its an inflammatory sebaceous cyst, needs to be incised and drained. If it is a lymph node, biopsy of it and blood work should be done.Hope this will help.Regards."},{"Patient":"I had a big steak and a beer before testing my blood pressure at a store machine.

I have some cartiledge loss in the knee itself.  could  this be a piece that came loose?  It's not always there but appears after strenuous activity.  Can't alway find it.  ?","Doctor":"Hello!Thank you for the query.Such lump is most likely a kind of ganglion. It is a benign cyst connected with a joint which contains joint fluid. Cartiledge loss is rather not related to this lump. However such cyst can appear after a knee injury.I suggest you to consult orthopedist. Knee ultrasound should be done. If this needs a surgery, arthroscopy needs to be done.Hope this will help.Regards."},{"Patient":"I discovered a lump on the top of my head. It is like as if I bumped my head and lump formed under the skull.  Any ideas as to what it could be.  Just had my hair dyed two days ago.  Could this have anything to do with causing the lump?  It is not painful.","Doctor":"Hello!Thank you for the query.Lump in such location is usually a sebaceous cyst. It grows spontaneously so you could not cause it. It is usually rounded, painless, with smooth surface lump. However it can get infected and due to pus accumulation can be painful.I suggest you to consult a surgeon with this lump. In case of doubts, soft tissues ultrasound can be done to determine what exactly it is. Cyst can be removed with small surgical procedure.Hope this will help.Regards."},{"Patient":"There is a small hard ball shaped bone like bump besides my right knee cap. It moves and causes snapping when I bend an put pressure on my knee. Fortunately I feel no pain. What could this be. I discovered it after a light bash to the knee.

Cyst which is connected with the joint is also possible. Both condition can give symptoms when putting pressure on the knee.The best way to find out what are you dealing with is to have an ultrasound of the knee and X-ray.

A couple days ago he touched it and was almost greasy feeling and stunk bad. I thought it was just grease from his hair. He just a moment ago pushed on it and a HUGE glob of whiteish pus came flying out. Any ideas?","Doctor":"Hello!Thank you for the query.From your description, for sure it is nothing serious. Most likely it is a kind of benign skin lesion like sebaceous cyst or pimple like lump. Pus presence in it indicates some kind of infection. Luckily, pus drainage is the right treatment for it. So if it has been completely drained, all you need to do is to have it under observation.

However sometimes such injury can cause veins rupture and some blood collection in the soft tissues. Bone fracture is also possible. That is why, I suggest your friend to consult a doctor. Foot X-ray should be done.

If this lump is located between the buttocks, pilonidal cyst is the most probable reason. If the lump is in the other location, sebacueus cyst or other benign skin lesion is the reason.In all mentioned cases, the lump needs to be incised and the pus drained. Otherwise it wont get healed by itself and the pain will become worse.Please consult a surgeon with this issue.Hope this will help.Regards."},{"Patient":"I have a hard, circular lump underneath my skin in the crease of my left leg near my pelvic area.

Recently, i have felt sensitivity when i urinate - it isn't pain or discomfort, but it just doesn't feel normal.","Doctor":"Hello!Thank you for the query.It is hardly possible that the lump under the skin is related to urinary tract issue.In mentioned by you location, lymph node or benign skin lesion are most probable. The best way to find out what it is, is to have soft tissues ultrasound of this area. In case of enlarged lymph node, biopsy should be done. Benign skin lesion can be removed with small incision.Sensitivity when urinating can be caused by urinary tract infection.

Any ideas?","Doctor":"Hi.Such a change on its own without any history of trauma is a serious matter as you may be suffering from some blood disorders.You should immediately get your blood tests done - particularly - bleeding time , clotting time , prothrombine time and all blood work with platelet count. Consult a Doctor immediately. If all the tests are normal then only you can be sure there is nothing serious about it.

If left untreated it may complicate to Atrial fibrillation, Flutter or Supraventricular Tachycardia (SVT). The cause is commonly hyperthyroidism, diabetes, mental stress, smoking, excess alcohol intake, etc. Pressure in the chest or squeezing crushing pain is the symptom of angina, caused due to reduced blood flow to the heart muscles. Avoid tobacco use, maintain blood cholesterol, blood sugar to the normal levels. Stop smoking, maintain a healthy diet, avoid addictions if any, alcohol & stay away from stress. Get all lipid function tests, stress test, Holter test, ECG, Echo done. Your treatment will depend upon the pathology detected.

Also will paracetamol help? Thank You","Doctor":"Hi ! Good evening. I am Dr Shareef answering your query.One of the common causes of a generalised lymphadenopathy on the neck region could be a viral fever, mononucleosis, which are associated with a upper respiratory tract infection/symptoms.If the lymphadenitis was due to simple infection, they would subside with the treatment of the infection. If they stay for longer duration, they have to be investigated upon with routine and some special blood tests, and a biopsy either FNAC or an excision biopsy depending on the position and size of the lymph gland for a histopathology.In your case, if you did have any treatment till now, I would have prescribed a course of antibiotics for you initially, and if they do not subside, I would go for all the investigations as noted above to arrive at a diagnosis and further management. Paracetamol might help temporarily for a symptomatic relief only.I hope this information would help you in discussing with your family physician/treating doctor in further management of your problem.

It s very firm, and a bit irregular in shape -- basically ovoid but with a little protrusion on top that seems attached to the skin. The remainder of the lump sits below the skin but does not appear to be embedded in the muscle.

My questions are: (1) what are the possible causes; and (2) what questions should I be armed with when I see the surgeon next week? Thanks","Doctor":"HI ! Good afternoon. I am Dr Shareef answering your query.The possible causes could be from a benign lesion like a sebaceous cyst to a malignant lesion unless ruled out by a biopsy. When you see your surgeon next week, he is going to ask you the duration of the lesion, if any pain or trauma associated with it, any feeling of bump anywhere else in your body. He would then do a clinical examination of the swelling to confirm its physical characteristics, and might advise you for either a FNAC (fine needle aspiration cytology) or an excision biopsy for a histo pathological study after some routine blood tests.

If a cyst forms after the surgery, he might have to remove it as well with a histo pathologicial study of the lesion. The most likey diagnosis however for the present goes towards an infected hair follicle of  the armpit, or an infected sebaceous cyst.I hope this information would help you in discussing with your family physician/treating doctor in further management of your problem.

Just feels stiff but I thought it was because of the grazes I sustained to it. Any ideas?","Doctor":"Hi ! Good evening. I am Dr Shareef answering your query. You might have got a hematoma of the knee (blood collection) due to the trauma. Walking without problem signifies that the joint ligaments and cartilages are possibly not injured. If there is no fresh ooze, the hematoma may gradually subside with absorption, but it would need proper rest and splintage of the joint. In case the problem increases which interferes with your walk, then you might have to see an orthopedic surgeon in your area, who might advise you for an x-ray/MRI of the injured knee joint. Till that you could start taking an anti inflammatory drug. Further management in that case would depend on the MRI report.I hope this information would help you in discussing with your family physician/treating doctor in further management of your problem. Please do not hesitate to ask in case of any further doubts.Thanks for choosing health care magic to clear doubts on your health problems. Wishing you an early recovery.

Its the worrying sensation in my right arm felt this past @5days that is very disturbing.","Doctor":"Hi ! Good evening. i am Dr Shareef answering your query.If I were your doctor, I would advise you for an X ray chest, and routine blood counts including ESR. The lump in your armpit must be big enough to put pressure on the nerves around that area which is causing the neurological symptoms on your right arm. If needed, I would not hesitate to refer you to a surgeon/medical specialist who after a clinical examination, might go for a FNAC of the lump, or an MRI of the chest wall including the axilla, which would let us know the nature of the lump.

About a month or so ago, I feel (not really hard) but I fell on my knee and now there is a small painless lump there on the right side of the kneecap.  What do you think it could be?  The spot was black and blue for a long time after I fell.","Doctor":"Hi ! Good morning. i am Dr Shareef answering your query.The lump initially must have been a collection of blood (hematoma) in the superficial tissue giving it the colour of black and blue. After the acute stage, and RBCs being absorbed, only serum remains, and this could have formed a serous cyst which persisted as a painless lump. This too could get absorbed gradually. In case it persists,or increases in size, you might have to consult a general surgeon/orthopedic surgeon in your area for further management.I hope this information would help you in discussing with your family physician/treating doctor in further management of your problem.

I am Dr Shareef answering your query. With the history of climbing of a steep hill, possibly you have ruptured/sprained your muscle, and this is causing a painful lump in your leg. If I were your doctor, I would give ice compress followed by a pressure bandage/stocking over the lump, advise you to give some rest to your leg and keep it elevated. Apart from it I would also prescribe an anti inflammatory drug for you along with a proton pump inhibitor. Small sprains with hematoma would gradually resolve in 10-14 days.

If the primary has thought that this is of no clinical significance, nothing can be done.

First of all if you are flying to a region that have a time difference from your place you might have JET LAG which basically alters our CIRCADIAN RHYTHM and make us feel dizzy. Second is the pill you are taking as its \\"Desogestrel\\" which is a hormone and it can be the cause of your HOT and COLD feeling.YES your heart rate is within normal limits but SYSTOLIC BP is slightly on lower side. what you can do to improve this is take an extra pinch of SALT in your diet and a cup of Coffee. If your feelings are due to low BP this will help improve your symptoms.After all this if you still feel the same then consult a doc in person so as to get a proper examination and some basics tests done.Good Luck"},{"Patient":"My 8 year old daughter has a mole above her right breast.

The lump is the size of a small mandarin orange and it bled when she tried to squeeze it. Should she go to an emergency or get an appointment with a dermatologist?","Doctor":"Hi ! Good evening. I am Dr Shareef answering your query. The duration of one year itself speaks of the slow growth trend of the lump, and thus goes more in favour of a benign growth. It could be a simple sebaceous/dermoid cyst, which has bled on being fiddled. However, this has to be biopsied and sent for histo pathology study to rule out any doubts.

Plus the associated radiating pain in left arm and leg also point towards the same. However, in some cases, palpitations might also happen due to some anemic disease where cardiopulmonary reserve is low.

If the surgery was done laparoscopically , this can be a small hernia. The pain come on as this may be involving some fat or other contents of abdomen. Headache may not be related to this.

I've had it for about a year but the size back then was barely noticeable when touched. Now it's a little bothersome and feels like it could be affecting a nerve because my arm will feel tingly at times and slightly hurt. What could this possibly be?","Doctor":"HI. Usually this is lymph node, and being close to the nerve you get the feeling of tingling. Get clinically checked by your Doctor. Also needed is routine and special blood tests like VDRL. High resolution ultrasonography and FNAC=fine needle cytology can help the diagnosis."},{"Patient":"My son (19 years old) has a swollen area just under his navel and to the left (in front of the left hip bone.  It appears puffy compared to the right side, and he said he can feel a swollen lymph node (also just in front of his hip bone.)  Are there lymph nodes there and what could this mean?","Doctor":"HI.

It feels like a bone and I can't use my hand properly when I get the pain. Do you know what it could be and what I can do to get ride of it instead of wearing a bandage every month?","Doctor":"Hi.

They have been that way for years now, Dr not really concerned since bloodwork is consistent with no elevated white count. Recently my scalp has broken out in what seems like foliculites and those lymph nodes have become even larger, easily visible when I turn my head to the right. At what point should I be concerned?","Doctor":"Hi.LN cluster for years - growing with scalp infection.In the first place I would advise you to get the scalp infection and that in the lymph nodes(LN) cleared with appropriate antibiotics under Doctor's supervision and Prescription.Once this is settled you may go for FNAC- fine needle aspiration cytology of the lymph nodes. Id this is inconclusive please go for excision of the lymph nodes for a proper biopsy report. Blood picture alone has no role in diagnosis of LN. Proper diagnosis is important as many diseases like tuberculosis can be dormant for years."},{"Patient":"Hi, I have an abscess on my jaw & my face has become very swollen.

Tonight it is very painful and red and swollen and throbs. I can t touch it. I soaked it tonight in warm water. Do corns have a gel inside and what can I do to get rid of it?","Doctor":"HI. This is an abscess and you have already removed the pus. The blood would come out ans is a good sign that the healing would be faster. I think you have to consult a Doctor to see whether the whole abscess is drained or not. If not you may need surgical drainage in a proper way.For Pain: Keep the foot elevated in lying down position above heart level. This aids in returning the fluid from the wound to the body- reduces edema and eventually pain. You also need to take antibiotic and anti-inflammatory medicines a advised by your Doctor ( these are prescription based medicines) This may not a be corn alone, it may be corn got infected ."},{"Patient":"I had a nasty hit to my shin when I was playing football four years ago.

Two months ago I found a very painful lump on my left breast areola. I waited four weeks, just in case it was a lump due to my cycle, but nothing changed. In fact, it is even worse now. The lump is larger, it covers a wider area of the areola and one of my glands seems swollen. The skin color is a bit darker, but there is no discharge. I am in constant pain, especially when I touch it. I went to my GP five days ago. He examined the area and squeezed the lump. He verified it was a lump and arranged on behalf of me an appointment at the hospital, which is for next week. A few hours after I left his office I started to have a low-grade fever (I still have) and the lump area seemed irritated. Could you please give me any ideas of what the lump may be? Thank you very much in advance","Doctor":"HI. With the history you have provided this can be an impending abscess with cellitis and you have too much pain. Ultrasonography would have diagnosed it nicely, go for one , Go for blood test as WBC may be elevated in infection. A course of an antibiotic and anti-inflammatory medicine would give you a relief. Another dreaded possibility is to have a cancer.  Diagnosis has to be made faster. Ultrasonography and FNAC would give a faster diagnosis. If needed incision and drainage with a sample for biopsy id the best way to diagnose or rule out the diagnosis."},{"Patient":"I have just noticed a small lump at the right hand side of my scrotum in between my scrotum and the thigh.

Sorry to know the history but happy to know you are positive and careful treatment you have undergone.The area you suggested is the rarest site to develop secondary of Ca breast. at least not heard of or seen to have lymph node involvement at this level.

I am 21 years old, weight is from 100-105 lbs, and height is 5ft 1.","Doctor":"Hi ThereAfter going through the details provided by you i would like to tell you that Vyvanse is basically a CNS stimulant drug mainly used for the treatment of BINGE EATING disorders (Excessive eating). For your pale look i would suggest you to get your CBC done and take proper sleep daily minimum of 7 hrs daily and avoid staying awake late night that will reduce your dark circles.Yes that chest pain could be due to acidity from your over eating habit. Get one ECG done also to make sure everything is ok in that.Good Luck"},{"Patient":"I blacked out and hit my head I think on the counter top lump very large, hand size, after 10 days there is still a lump but it is smaller.

Just hurts. This morning I got up because it hurt so bad and went to the restroom and after having a bowel movement I turned to reach for toilet paper and I felt something pop.

I kept pushing until the lump seemed a little smaller and majority of the discharge was blood. What is this?

Such cyst can be seen as a little hole between the buttocks.When the cyst became inflamed, pus accumulates in it and it gives strong pain. The lump usually becomes hard. When the pus is evacuated, the pain goes away.

That is why every mole which itches, becomes reddish, starts to grow, should be removed and checked under a microscope to make sure it is not malignant.

Generally if its not a mole, most likely its a benign lesion (from your description it sounds like a fibroma).

If it remains high, you will medications.Thanks"},{"Patient":"I have a small lump on the inside of my right leg, just above the knee.  It is not red. It is hard. It is sometimes painful....burning....and othertimes it doesn't hurt at all.  I was wondering if it could be a parasite under the skin living in my tissue....or is it just a cyst?","Doctor":"Hi.Since how long have you got this ?This is the most unusual site for parasite.There is more chance of this being a cyst or lipoma or neuroma. I would advise such a patient to consult the Surgeon and get this excised.The excision helps in two ways : First , one gets the disease out of the body. Secondly , you get a histopathological diagnosis to confirm what is was."},{"Patient":"Hi I woke up last Tuesday morning with a sore and swollen eye (it felt like I had two styes one in the corner of my eye at the side of my nose and another within my eyelid towards the external side of my eye. My eye was very sore and swollen and subsequently developed into a very alarming black eye. My vision is fine and I was flying that day. I have since been to see a pharmacist who gave me arnica tablets. This morning the swelling is almost gone (although the bruising all around my eye area is really bad) but I feel I have some unexplained lumps at the top of my eyelid where I felt the original sty was. These lumps seem to move.","Doctor":"hi. these lumps can be aftermath of the edema or the cysts which develop after the styes resolve. They are self-limiting most of the times, if you not fiddle with them."},{"Patient":"Hello, wonder if you can help me as I'm getting rather concerned. Few weeks back playing football I had a collision that gave me a bruise, and now the bruisings gone down, pains gone away, I'm left with a lump and when pressed on its bloody painful, I've read into it tonight on the internet, and there's no real answer to what it could be, anywhere to small fracture to cancer but thanks for replying.","Doctor":"Hi.The pain on pressure on an old lump can be due to::: Due to the process of healing called organization, the nerves can become pressed on or entrapped in a scar. Hematoma getting tender can be due to tightness (tense).If there is a fracture the pain will be persistent and cancers are totally a different problem , it is not a cancer"},{"Patient":"For the last 48 hours every minute or less, I suddenly get a hot sensation on the top of my left foot but with no pain.  Occasionally, the warmth is felt on the back side of my left leg as well.  It started after about a week or so ago after I discovered a lump on the base of my skull where the neck and skull meets just to the right of the spine.  Should I be concerned enough to go see a doctor or is this just a pinched nerve?","Doctor":"Hi. Pinched nerve in the neck can not cause hot sensation in the foot.But a spinal condition can. You should take a consultation of a Neurologist for a complete clinical examination , so that he can find out which part of the spine needs MRI.A proper diagnosis is very important. It would be very good for you to find the cause at an early stage to avoid further complications."},{"Patient":"I randomly get small bumps on my top lip, and along the edge of my lower lip. This happens every couple days and doesn't seem to have a cause. The bumps seem to be just swollen lumps since they don't have a particular color (same color as my lips), and after a little bit of time they go away on their own. As their appearing, I can feel them developing and they make my lip feel dry and itchy. What could this be?","Doctor":"Hi. This can very well be herpes simplex. Indicates your low body resistance. I would advise you to see a dermatologist to confirm what it is and get a proper treatment. You have to take multivitamins and other supplements as advised by your Doctor for quite a long time so that the body immunity improves."},{"Patient":"I have a large lump, about the size of a silver dollar, and it is movable back and forth (slightly) but not up and down.  It is swollen in the tissue around the lump, warm to the touch and has one or more large veins going into it.  I have had this for more than a year, and it bothers me, but doctors do not seem interested.","Doctor":"Hi. Your pointing / mentioning the site of the ump would have helped me more. Anyways , from the history you have provided this looks to be a lesion which needs to be excised and subjected to histopathology examination.Prior ultrasound with color doppler can tell us a probable diagnosis so that a proper care can be taken. Hemangiomas can bleed far more than any other lesions so the need for pre-operative investigations . Go ahead , change the Doctor . better visit a surgeon , who would be interested in getting a proper diagnosis and giving you a proper treatment."},{"Patient":"Hi,Around a month ago, my wife had a small lump in front of her ear.  The doctor gave her the antibiotic and something to drain her nose due to a small infection.  This lump is still there.  It didn’t go away.Now, she is having a lump behind her left ear.  It is around 2 weeks since the day she noticed it.  She went to see the doctor and was told to get the blood work done and X-Ray behind her back.  We are still waiting for the result.My question is, is this lump a cancer?  If it is a cancer, can it be curable?  Thank you.","Doctor":"HI. This is the most UNUSUAL place for the cancers to develop. So do not worry.This is most probably due to a lymph node enlargement secondary to infection in nose as you rightly said. The lymph node behind the ear also got the infection as they are internally connected. These Lymph nodes are notorious to get small.... A proper FNAC - fine needle aspiration cytology will solve the problem .  So most probably this may not be a cancer, And it is curable if at all it is a cancer."},{"Patient":"I have a bruise like lump on my left hand. It is directly below the knuckle of my pinky finger.

The sweat and other factors increase the problem.The minor injuries inflicted during itching can lead to collection of small abscesses, this is what you must have. Do not apply any local ointments as it can lead to growth of opportunistic bacteria to give rise to worst form of infection.You may apply locally liquid povidone iodine as it kills all bacteria and is the least reactive.Keep the area clean and dry.Consult a Doctor to get a prescription based antibiotics and multivitamins.This will heal very fast.Continue multi-vitamins for a long duration for the skin integrity to increase nicely."},{"Patient":"Hey guys, I took a injection into my right cheek week ago and couple days ago I noticed a large lump inside my cheek.

This clinical examination has no alternative and should be checked.Waiting for the reports ."},{"Patient":"My wife was dressing this morning when she felt something strange in her chest. A strange lump suddenly appeared on her right collar bone near her throat. It appeared in a matter of moments and for no apparent reason. It is sore to touch and she said it was also painful to lift her arm. the lump seems firm and does not move","Doctor":"HI. This is indicative of bleeding either in the thyroid nodule which was not felt beforehand, or in a lymph node. Ultrasonography and a consultation with an ENT Specialist for clinical examination will give a proper diagnosis. The painful lifting of the arm may be due to inflammation spread to muscle/ nerves in the vicinity."},{"Patient":"Hi,around 3 months ago,my friend had an annus surgery (to stop the pain and blood when entered to toilet)now after 3 mths of pain he discovered something like ball near the anus more to the left side, he did an MRI with the following result:MRI examination of the perineum was performed in the sagittal T2, coronal T1, T2, and Axial T1, T2 and STIR sequences. additional post Gadolinium coronal and axial T1 sequences were also obtained.there is a 1.5 cm fluid collection in the left perianal region at around 3 o'clock with surrounding edematous changes, it appears hypointense on T1,hyper on T2,STIR with peripheral enhancement following IV gadolinium administration and is compatible with a small abscess. the levator ani muscles are normal. no other gross abnomalities are seen. should he perform another surgery to remove it? is it dangerous?, could it be cancerous???? i'm really concerned thank you in advance for your feedback","Doctor":"HI.Thanks for your concern and understanding of the subject.The abscess / lump which has recurred after the first surgery like this has to be taken and treated as ''fistula-in-ano'' unless proved otherwise. The biopsy thereafter a surgery will confirm the diagnosis , underlying pathology and so on. He has to undergo another surgery.It is not much dangerous but notoriously recurrent / may not be a cancer."},{"Patient":"I noticed a lump on the left side of my neck today that feels warm. Never noticed the lump before but I hadn't checked specifically. I also felt dizzy and sore throat this morning.Meanwhile, I've been investigating a persistent cough that has gotten worse over the past year, and I have seen some blood in my sputum, more frequently over the past month or two. I had a CT and there was nothing that explained the blood. Could the new warm lump be related to the coughing blood, or is that probably an unrelated virus (with sore throat and lightheadedness)? What should I do next, and is it urgent?","Doctor":"Hi. Thanks for an elucidate history.Cough of more than a year... with blood in sputum 1 month or so. Normal CT scan. I hope you have gone for Mantoux skin test and Sputum AFB ( for TB) , gram staining and culture sensitivity... tests also.NOw a lump in the neck.This is good that you have another problem where you can undergo a test of FNAC to see there is no TB>The node can be very well related to the coughing problem."},{"Patient":"Hello - I have been experiencing discomfort similar to a lump under my right rib cage.

Thank you,f","Doctor":"HI. This can be a hernia as you have rightly noticed... The pain under the rib cage can be due to pulling in of some structures in the hernia. At the same time an acid reflux too can have varied symptoms... Please go for a clinical examination as this is important to find out the real cause. Supportive Ultrasonography and Endoscopy to confirm or rule out the other causes will lead to a definite diagnosis and treatment."},{"Patient":"i have been having chest pains for the past 2 months now and im only 17. i have been to the doctors 6 times. the first couple of times they said it was muscle pain but the tablets never worked. next time i went back he said it was deffenatly not my heart and that made me less worried because ive had panic attacks over this. i went again because i was scared and to calm me down he gave me an ecg test and it came back fine. they now think its due to worrying to much but i cant help but think different. it is not a bad pain, it is usually on the left side of my breat near my arm. sometimes on the right but hardly ever and sometimes theres a slight tingle in the middle of my chest. also i have little tingles in my hand and fingers and shooting pains. the pains everywhere mostly feel like shooting pains. please help me, im very scared.","Doctor":"Hi,This is Dr Sameer, cardiologist.Pain in chest due to heart disease is very rare at your age. Chest pain due to heart disease is non localized, squeezing type & increase on exertion. Still you need to do a 2D Echo for cardiac evaluation.Chest pain at your age can be simple muscle pain or costochondritis(inflammation of joint between bone & cartilage of chest wall). Both are treated with pain killer. Tab Ultraset will be safe & good for you. And i also think that your anxiety is increasing the pain. So don't worry & stop thinking about the pain.

I am also a cancer survivor with my last chemo last March 2013. I want to know if it has something to do with cancer or just overused muscles and nerves. Thanks for your response.","Doctor":"Hi. Great that you are a cancer survivor. If the lumps are fixed and move with muscle movements only , they can be from the over-used muscles , a sort of knot formation. Another possibility can be multiple lymph nodes= as they are bilateral there is more chance of being infective in origin as they are painful too. Can be recurrence of cancer.The best way is to get a clinical examination by the Doctor and FNAC of the masses... Get a diagnosis and get stress-free."},{"Patient":"My 8-yr-old daughter had a red, bumpy rash on her wrist, then this morning she woke up with the same sort of thing on her face below her mouth.

Wouldn't I have felt all this before if it was from that? What else could it be?","Doctor":"Hello!Thank you for the query.As this lump is associated with recent injury, most probable reason of your symptoms is a blood accumulation (hematoma) which has gotten infected and turned into an abscess. If so, the area should be painful, swollen. You may also have fever and weakness due to infection.I suggest you to consult a surgeon. In case  of any doubts, ultrasound should be done. Abscess should be incised and drained.Hope this will help.Regards."},{"Patient":"I am terrified!!! I regularly have several lumps under both armpits and groin area.

Are these all signs of something serious I should look further into?","Doctor":"Hello!Thank you for the query.Yes, this symptoms can indicate serious issue and you should not wait with it any longer. The lumps you have under your armpits and groins are lymph nodes. Along with mentioned symptoms you may have a Lymphoma or chronic infection.

It started under my nose, spread up to the bridge of my nose near my eye, and then a sore on the outside of my ear (all on my right side). I have been taking Valtrex for 12 days, but now although my face is almost completely healed, it has now showed up on my left ear, this time inside the ear canal. I feel pain in both ears. I also seem to have some head congestion and am taking a decongestant. I saw a doctor when the symptoms started, when they got near my eye, but not yet to my ear. I was given Valtrex (2 GM twice in 24 hours and then stop). I called the clinic when it first went in my right ear. I was told too refill the Valtrex and take 1 GM every 8 hours for 6 more days. I wanted to be seen, but they could not work me in. At the end of the 6 days, I discovered the sores on and in my left ear. I called the clinic, once again, they could not work me in (an Army clinic short 3 doctors). I was told I could just go to the ER. My husband is deployed and I have three children, so instead, I refilled the prescription again to do another 7 day round. I have an appointment at the clinic on Thursday, but I am wondering if I need to try to be seen sooner. I am wondering if it is normal for it to spread even while on Valtrex. I am also concerned about my protecting my hearing, but wondering if there is anything else that can be done besides Valtrex even if I can be seen at the clinic sooner.","Doctor":"Hi. Thanks for an elucidate history. Yes, you were diagnosed and treated rightly.I do not think that the recurrence on the other side can be the same , this is very rare to have the symptoms in spite of your treatment.

Since you have a problem of more than a year it will be wise to get all the relevant blood tests done including blood sugar.I would also advise such a patient to surgically remove the disease and subject the specimen for biopsy as it may come up with a proper diagnosis, as the abscess does not last this long.

Its a kind of skin lesion very characteristic for the described by you area. Due to ingrown hair in this area tissues get irritated and inflammation appears. This leads to cyst formation which can be noticeable as a lump or ball. Sooner or alter such cyst gets infected what leads to pus accumulation.

Apart from this, all the routine blood examination including your thyroid status have to be confirmed.However, before embarking on any kind of management plan, you have to be clinically examined by your family physician/general surgeon/ENT specialist to arrive at a provisional diagnosis.I hope this information would help you in discussing with your family physician/treating doctor in further management of your problem.

I have full movement with some pain, and stiffness due to the swelling and my thumb is slightly numb. If I palpitate the area it really hurts but if I leave it alone, the pain subsides to a small full ache. I did do a ton of push-ups yesterday and have been doing them quite frequently the past 2 weeks after years of not doing them. I did not experience pain doing them yesterday, it was several hours later when I found the \\"injury.\\" What could this be?","Doctor":"Hello!Thank you for the query.The most probable lump in such location is a ganglion. Its a kind of joint herniation which leads to a lump formation. Such lump is soft in touch, painful and filled with clear gel like fluid. It does not increase cancer risk.

Please note that ribs are connected with the sternum with cartilages what allows chest to move. In case of any injury, overstrain, an inflammatory process can appear.

And this is due to inability of that particular skin for not coping with hormonal changes. If the medical management fails to resolve this condition then surgery is a good option. As this type of surgery is rarely performed , it may be an exercise for you to find someone who does this. Get a Consultation of a Surgeon. You may try something like Doxycyclin 100 mg once a day with water for a long time say 1 to 4 weeks if you are not allergic to this. Sometimes this helps. Apply liquid povidone iodine locally to the affected area thrice daily; this may help to stop the recurrent infection. Take multiviatmins to give skin a support."},{"Patient":"Hi i banged my shin off a metal bar around 3 weeks ago altho when i say banged it was quite severe,there still feels to be some sort of lump there,its painful to touch and its sending shootin pains all the way up the front of me leg,what could this be??","Doctor":"Hi.This is called a post-traumatic neuroma.Many of them might settle with time.

It is not related to coronary artery disease. Anyway, I would recommend performing some tests to investigate for the possible underlying causes: - a chest X Ray study- a resting ECG- complete blood count, PCR, ESR for inflammation- a resting ECG and a cardiac ultrasound to examine your heart. An ambulatory 24-48 hours ECG monitoring would help exclude possible cardiac arrhythmia underlying your palpitations. Other tests (thyroid hormone levels, blood electrolytes) are necessary to exclude possible metabolic causes that can lead to palpitations. Hope to have been helpful!Kind regards, Dr. Iliri"},{"Patient":"I have a lump at the base of my neck, on the right side, where my shoulder is. The size of a small plum.

I have just noticed a very large egg-shaped lump and bruise on my inner thigh that gives be pain when I walk. Could it be from carrying wood for my wood stove?","Doctor":"Hi ! Good evening. I am Dr Shareef answering your query.From the history, it seems that you might have sustained some kind of trivial trauma while cutting woods resulting in oozing of blood in the tissue forming a collection of blood (hematoma). Usually, small collections of blood get absorbed of their own. However, this may not happen in cases where the blood clotting is hampered by the intake of blood thinners as is in your case and the same might also get infected causing more pain due to an abscess.If I were your doctor, I would consult your physician who started your blood thinning agent for consideration of discontinuing these medicines for some time till it heals up.If it does not even then, I would refer you to a general surgeon for a  clinical examination and further management.I hope this information would help you in discussing with your family physician/treating doctor in further management of your problem.

Please can you help me. i would go to the doctors but feel very embarrassed.","Doctor":"Hi ! Good evening. I am Dr Shareef answering your query.Although a physical/clinical examination is required to diagnose your problem, the history you have narrated points more towards a perianal abscess, either a primary one, or due to the closure of the external opening of a fistula in ano. Apart from this, the hemorrhoids could get prolapsed and strangulated resulting in a painful swelling in the perianal region.If I were your doctor,  I would advise you for a routine blood check up including a blood sugar, and refer you to a general surgeon for a clinical evaluation and further management.I hope this information would help you in discussing with your family physician/treating doctor in further management of your problem.

At first it only hurt to sit backwards, like relaxing on a couch, but now it even hurts when I lay on my back or bend over (it's been 2-3 days). It's kind of swollen & raw (feels hard). Doesn't hurt to touch it, walk, sit up right (unless the chair is weird), & doesn't itch or smell. I'm wondering if it's a rash & I should just buy diaper rash cream? But it doesn't look like a rash & doesn't itch. No change in detergents or lotions. Didn't bump it against anything either.","Doctor":"Hi,It seems that there might be having some infection like dermatitis on the part due to poor local hygiene as it is difficult to reach for proper cleaning the part.There is more perspiration on the part leading to infection.Now it seems that there might be having bacterial infection giving this problem.Apply antibiotic cream after cleaning.Go for one antibiotic medicine course for 3 days.Keep local part perspiration less and cleanOk and take care."},{"Patient":"Hello.

As for the sores at the corners of the mouth- this is called angular stomatitis and the cause is vitamins and folic acid deficiency. The root cause may be bad eating habits/ enterocolitis of some sort. This deficiency also causes the reduced resistance of the body giving easy infections and loss of weight.I would suggest such a patient to be first clinically evaluated by a Pediatrician and / or Pediatric gastroenterologist- HE would suggest further tests on examination and would advise mutivitamins and folic acid in proper doses as also an antibiotic and metronidazole. I would advise you to give him Vit A one cap daily for 6 days and Calcirol sachet one every week for 3 weeks. ( if your Pediatrician does not write separately).This is going to help in a long run  for a healthy baby. Give a shot of tablet for worms. Follow Orthopedic Surgeon for the growth at bone.I hope this helps you and your son to get a cure.

He will have daily red stool or urine due to Rifampicin- this is normalNeeds high protein diet and mutiviatmins in the for of antioxidant capsules.Injection streptomycin is also a very good additional medicine- to be taken for first 2 months only.Lymph nodes take a lot of time to heal and shrink, so do not worry about the size reduction.Observe for increase in appetite, weight gain , feeling better and such symptoms and signs."},{"Patient":"My 14 yr old daughter has a lump under the skin of her right areola when applying pressure or squeezing there seems to be some discharge coming from the areola area she says the lump doesn t hurt only when she squeezes the area or touches it to much what do you think this might be?","Doctor":"HI.IT is possible to have such presentation due to hormonal changes.

I don't know what this is.","Doctor":"Hello and thanks, The symptoms may be due to many reasons.The first is endometrioma as it comes and goes and you have history of endometriosis. It is rare but possible. Check to see if its appearance has any relation to menstruation. Other possibilities are a hernia, lipoma, hemangioma and so on. They are all soft and may be painful. Hernia is a prolapse of abdominal contents mostly intestine or omentum from a small defect or hole in the abdomen coverings. Lipomas and hemangiomas are non cancerous tumors of different tissues.

Had one incident in following months when chest pain bad enough had to sit down and felt quite rough for about 15 minutes. But ususally just an off and on pain. Can be a little breathless at times and chest feels like someone sat on it sometimes. Also occasionally heartbeat goes erractic. Went back to GP in January after another day of bad chest pain but felt a lump about an inch across in the tissue behind the breast towards upper middle. Mammogram and ultrasound clear.

I also noticed there was a lump/bump beneath my skin at the location of the swelling and a noticeable warmth at the site. I waited a couple of days to see if the swelling would go away but when my condition stayed the same, I went to an urgent care center. They ruled out DVT based on my symptoms and they suggested it was an infection of some sort and prescribed me an antibiotic, which I never took. I wasn t 100% confident with their prognosis since there was no open wound/bite mark of any sort and the itch felt like it was beneath the skin and not topical as scratching did not alleviate the discomfort. Over the next few days, my lower leg became increasingly swollen and the bump moved to my inner calf/leg. When I noticed my ankle started to swell, I went to the ER to get an ultrasound and it too came back negative for DVT. Long story short, over the next two weeks, the lump/bump, which is now more of a mass the size of a child s fist, has migrated. What started as swelling from my lower calf has migrated to my inner calf, up to my knee, up to inner thigh, front of the thigh, and now, at the three week mark, it is on my hip. The mass is still warm to the touch, itchy, and has also left slight bruising and small residual bumps along it s path. I have been to my family doctor twice since going to the ER and he has no idea what it is or what could have caused it. He has referred me to a rheumatologist and am now waiting for my HMO insurance to approve it before I can see her. I have been stressing about this for weeks without any answers. Please help!","Doctor":"Hi.The first mistake you did was NO TO TAKE antibiotics.This can be due to inflamation of the lymphatic channels = Lymphangitis. or multiple abscess with skip areasor Thrombophebitis.This does not occur in DVT.If sonography is showing a collection of pus, you need to get it operated / drained.If no pus, antibiotics and anti-inflammatory medicines for a longer duration of time/ elevation of the limb above heart level.

But insist to go for USG guided FNAC- Fine needle aspiration cytology, as this may give a diagnosis , sonography can not tell whether this is cancer or not. If required / in doubt request them for excision biopsy; as this being a cancer or not has all the different implications on life and many patients out of fear or out of expectation make it late for diagnosis changing the stage in which they may be suffering.I am not trying to frighten you, want to make you aware to go for the tissue diagnosis at the earliest. to decide that nature of it.

One of the lumps has clear water and the other has pus.The one on the thigh might have been just  a seroma inside or a lymph vessel might have been ruptured into in giving a clear fluid.

As you have consulted many cardiologist and they have a different opinion so in this case it's important to see your father's angiogram first so as to see how many blockages are there and how critical they are and it's not wise to give my opinion with reviewing angiogram.However in general I can tell you that if the blockages are at multiple locations and have a diffuse course or if the Left main coronary artery ( also called widow maker)is affected it's advised to go for a bypass surgery. I know it's sounds dangerous to go for a heart surgery but studies have shown that bypass surgery gives slightly better long term survival rates in good surgeon's hands.

The pleura is a lining of the lungs that is just below the rib cage and just above the lungs. There is a space between 2 pleura.

Some symptoms of this include pain in the chest, pain while breathing, difficulty in breathing, coughing, and pain while coughing. Most pneumothorax is very easily detected in an X-ray. There are, however, other diseases which occur with a needle prick that enters too deep and these can cause chest pain and breathing difficulty as well.

When it’s at healthy levels in your blood, it removes extra cholesterol and plaque buildup in your arteries and then sends it to your liver. Your liver expels it from your body. Ultimately, this will help reduce your risk of heart disease, heart attack, and stroke.An ideal HDL level is 60 milligrams/deciliter (mg/dL) or above. Your HDL is considered low if it’s below 40 mg/dL. You should aim to have HDL levels between 40 and 60 mg/dL. Now am gonna suggest you to add some of these food items in your meals to increase your HDLBeans and legumes,Whole grains, High-fiber fruits, Fatty fish like Salmon, Flax.
