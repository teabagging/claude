Solving the Inequality: To find the range of x values satisfying |2x-1| < 1, we solve the inequality:[-1 < 2x-1 < 1]Adding 1 to all parts of the inequality, we get:[0 < 2x < 2]Dividing everything by 2 yields:[0 < x < 1]This step involves basic algebraic manipulations to solve the absolute value inequality.Therefore, the range of values for x that satisfy f(2x-1) < f(1) is boxed{(0,1)}."},{"problem":"Given the function f(x) = x - 1 - a ln x.(1) Find the value of a such that f(x) geqslant 0;(2) Let m be an integer, and for any positive integer n, (1+frac{1}{2})(1+frac{1}{2^{2}})dots(1+frac{1}{2^{n}}) < m, find the minimum value of m.","solution":"(1) Since the function f(x) = x - 1 - a ln x, x > 0,the derivative is f'(x) = 1 - frac{a}{x} = frac{x-a}{x}, and f(1) = 0.When a leqslant 0, f'(x) > 0 always holds, making y = f(x) monotonically increasing on (0,+infty), which contradicts f(x) geqslant 0.When a > 0, let f'(x) = 0, we get x = a.So, y = f(x) is monotonically decreasing on (0, a) and monotonically increasing on (a, +infty), meaning f(x)_{min} = f(a).Since f(x)_{min} = f(a) geqslant 0, we have a = 1.(2) From (1), when a = 1, f(x) = x - 1 - ln x geqslant 0, implying ln x leqslant x - 1.Therefore, ln (x + 1) leqslant x if and only if x = 0.So, ln (1 + frac{1}{2^k})  (1 + frac{1}{2})(1 + frac{1}{2^2})(1 + frac{1}{2^3}) = frac{135}{64} > 2,and when n geqslant 3, (1 + frac{1}{2})(1 + frac{1}{2^2})dots(1 + frac{1}{2^n}) in (2, e).Since m is an integer and for any positive integer n, (1+frac{1}{2})(1+frac{1}{2^{2}})dots(1+frac{1}{2^{n}}) < m holds,the minimum value of m is boxed{3}."},{"problem":"Suppose F is a polygon with lattice vertices and sides parralell to x-axis and y-axis.Suppose S(F),P(F) are area and perimeter of F.\\rFind the smallest k that:\\rS(F) leq k.P(F)^2","solution":"1. Understanding the Problem:   We need to find the smallest constant ( k ) such that for any polygon ( F ) with lattice vertices and sides parallel to the x-axis and y-axis, the inequality ( S(F) leq k cdot P(F)^2 ) holds, where ( S(F) ) is the area and ( P(F) ) is the perimeter of ( F ).2. Analyzing the Case of a Rectangle:   Consider a rectangle with side lengths ( a ) and ( b ). The area ( S ) and perimeter ( P ) of the rectangle are given by:   [   S = a cdot b   ]   [   P = 2a + 2b   ]   We need to express ( S ) in terms of ( P ):   [   S = a cdot b   ]   [   P = 2(a + b) implies a + b = frac{P}{2}   ]   Using the Arithmetic Mean-Geometric Mean Inequality (AM-GM Inequality), we have:   [   frac{a + b}{2} geq sqrt{a cdot b} implies frac{P}{4} geq sqrt{S} implies left(frac{P}{4}right)^2 geq S implies frac{P^2}{16} geq S   ]   Therefore, for a rectangle, we have:   [   S leq frac{P^2}{16}   ]3. Generalizing to Other Polygons:   For polygons with lattice vertices and sides parallel to the x-axis and y-axis, we can consider the following:   - If the polygon is concave, we can extend its border to form a convex polygon (specifically a rectangle) without increasing the perimeter.   - The area of the concave polygon will be less than or equal to the area of the rectangle formed by extending its borders.   - Therefore, the ratio ( frac{S(F)}{P(F)^2} ) for a concave polygon will be less than or equal to that of a rectangle.4. Conclusion:   Since the inequality ( S(F) leq frac{P(F)^2}{16} ) holds for rectangles and the area of any concave polygon is less than or equal to the area of the rectangle with the same perimeter, the smallest ( k ) that satisfies the inequality for all such polygons is ( frac{1}{16} ).[boxed{frac{1}{16}}]"},{"problem":"Among the following points in the Cartesian coordinate system, the point that lies on the x-axis is:A: (0,2)B: (-2,-3)C: (-1,-2)D: (-2,0)","solution":"To determine which point lies on the x-axis, we recall that any point on the x-axis has a y-coordinate of 0.

Statistical Definition of ProbabilityThe classical definition of probability assumes that all elementary outcomes are equally likely. The equal likelihood of outcomes is inferred from considerations of symmetry (as in the case of a coin or a die). Problems where symmetry considerations can be applied are rare in practice. In many cases, it is difficult to provide a basis for assuming that all elementary outcomes are equally likely. This led to the need to introduce another definition of probability, called the statistical definition. To give this definition, the concept of relative frequency of an event is introduced first.The relative frequency of an event, or frequency, is the ratio of the number of trials in which the event occurred to the total number of trials. The frequency of event A is denoted by W(A), then by definitionW(A)=frac{m}{n}where m is the number of trials in which event A occurred; n is the total number of trials.The frequency of an event has the following properties.1. The frequency of a random event is a number between zero and one:0<W(A)<12. The frequency of a certain event U is one:W(U)=13. The frequency of an impossible event V is zero:W(V)=04. The frequency of the sum of two mutually exclusive events A and B is equal to the sum of the frequencies of these events:W(A+B)=W(A)+W(B)Observations have shown that the relative frequency has the property of statistical stability: in different series of multiple trials (in each of which the event may or may not occur), it takes values close to some constant. This constant, which is an objective numerical characteristic of the phenomenon, is considered the probability of the given event.The probability of an event is the number around which the values of the frequency of the given event group in different series of a large number of trials.This definition of probability is called the statistical definition.In the case of the statistical definition of probability, it has the following properties: 1) the probability of a certain event is one; 2) the probability of an impossible event is zero; 3) the probability of a random event is between zero and one; 4) the probability of the sum of two mutually exclusive events is equal to the sum of the probabilities of these events."},{"problem":"section*{Problem 4 - 111244}a) Determine all ordered triples ((x, y, z)) of real numbers that satisfy the equation (x^{3} z + x^{2} y + x z + y = x^{5} + x^{3}).b) Among the triples found in a), identify those in which exactly one of the three numbers (x, y, z) is positive, exactly one is negative, and exactly one is zero.","solution":"}a) The equation can be equivalently transformed to (left(x^{2}+1right)left(x z+y-x^{3}right)=0). The first factor is positive for all real numbers. Therefore, it suffices to consider the second factor. For (x=0), (y=0) and (z in mathbb{R}) can be arbitrary, so we have the triples ((0,0, z)). For (x neq 0), we can solve the equation for (z) to get (z=x^{2}-frac{y}{x}) and obtain the solution triple (left(x, y, x^{2}-frac{y}{x}right)) for any (x, y in mathbb{R}).b) From (x=0) it follows that (y=0). From (z=0) it follows that (y=x^{3}). Therefore, the other two coordinates have the same sign. Hence, only (y=0) remains. In this case, (z=x^{2}).

A polynomial P of degree 2007 has the property that Pleft(r_j+dfrac{1}{r_j}right)=0 for j=1,ldots,2007.  Determine the value of P(1)/P(-1).","solution":"1. Given the polynomial ( f(x) = x^{2007} + 17x^{2006} + 1 ) with distinct zeroes ( r_1, r_2, ldots, r_{2007} ), we need to determine the value of ( frac{P(1)}{P(-1)} ) for a polynomial ( P ) of degree 2007 that satisfies ( Pleft(r_j + frac{1}{r_j}right) = 0 ) for ( j = 1, ldots, 2007 ).2. Since ( Pleft(r_j + frac{1}{r_j}right) = 0 ) for each ( j ), we can infer that ( P(z) ) has roots of the form ( r_j + frac{1}{r_j} ). Therefore, ( P(z) ) can be expressed as:   [   P(z) = c prod_{j=1}^{2007} left(z - left(r_j + frac{1}{r_j}right)right)   ]   for some constant ( c ).3. To find ( frac{P(1)}{P(-1)} ), we need to evaluate ( P(1) ) and ( P(-1) ). Notice that:   [   P(1) = c prod_{j=1}^{2007} left(1 - left(r_j + frac{1}{r_j}right)right)   ]   and   [   P(-1) = c prod_{j=1}^{2007} left(-1 - left(r_j + frac{1}{r_j}right)right)   ]4. We need to simplify these products. Consider the polynomial ( f(z) = z^{2007} + 17z^{2006} + 1 ). The roots ( r_j ) satisfy ( f(r_j) = 0 ). We can use the symmetry of the roots and their reciprocals to simplify the expressions.5. By Vieta's formulas, the sum of the roots ( r_j ) of ( f(x) ) is given by the coefficient of ( x^{2006} ) divided by the leading coefficient (with a sign change):   [   sum_{j=1}^{2007} r_j = -17   ]6. To find ( frac{P(1)}{P(-1)} ), we need to consider the behavior of the polynomial ( f(z) ) at specific points. We use the fact that ( P(z) = cf(z)fleft(frac{1}{z}right) ) for some constant ( c ).7. Evaluating ( f(z) ) at ( omega ) and ( omega^2 ), where ( omega ) is a primitive 6th root of unity, we get:   [   f(omega) = omega^{2007} + 17omega^{2006} + 1   ]   and   [   f(omega^2) = (omega^2)^{2007} + 17(omega^2)^{2006} + 1   ]8.

Therefore:   [   f(omega) = omega^5 + 17omega^4 + 1   ]   and   [   f(omega^2) = omega^2 + 17omega + 1   ]10. The ratio ( frac{P(1)}{P(-1)} ) is given by:    [    frac{P(1)}{P(-1)} = left|frac{f(omega)}{f(omega^2)}right|^2    ]11.

The sheet is then folded to create an open-topped box. To maximize the volume of the box, the value of x should be __________.","solution":"Let's consider the problem step by step:1. First, define the dimensions of the box. The original iron sheet is a square with side length 12 cm. Cutting off four small squares of side length x from each corner, the new length and width of the box are (12 - 2x) cm each, because two lengths of x are removed from each side of the sheet.2. The height of the box will be x cm as the material from the corners is folded up.3. The volume V of the box is calculated as:[ V = text{length} times text{width} times text{height} ]Using the new dimensions, this translates to:[ V = (12 - 2x)^2 times x ][ V = 4x (6 - x)^2 ]4. To maximize the volume, we differentiate the volume function with respect to x, set it equal to zero, and solve for x.The derivative is found as follows:[ V'(x) = 4(6-x)^2 - 8x(6-x) ]Setting ( V'(x) ) equal to zero gives:[ 4(6-x)^2 - 8x(6-x) = 0 ][ 4(6-x)(6-x) - 8x(6-x) = 0 ][ (6-x)(4(6-x)-8x) = 0 ][ (6-x)(24 - 4x - 8x) = 0 ][ (6-x)(24 - 12x) = 0 ]The volume is a maximum when ( 6 - x = 0 ) or ( 24 - 12x = 0 ), but since ( 24 - 12x = 0 ) leads to a negative value (x = 2), the maximum volume occurs when ( 6 - x = 0 ), which gives ( x = 6 ). However, a height of 6 would lead to no box at all because it would take up the entire height of the original square, therefore the maximum volume occurs just before this point. To maximize the volume within the limitations of the problem, we can re-examine the equation.[ V = 4x (6 - x)^2 ]Since we can't use ( x = 6 ), we need to determine the next best value for x.Using AM-GM inequality can be helpful:[ 2x + (6 - x) + (6 - x) geq 3sqrt[3]{2x(6 - x)^2} ][ 12 geq 3sqrt[3]{2x(6 - x)^2} ][ 4 geq sqrt[3]{2V} ][ 64 geq 2V ][ V leq 32 ]Equality is achieved when the three terms in the AM-GM inequality are equal, i.e., when ( 6 - x = 2x ), which gives ( x = 2 ) cm. This also fits within the constraints of the problem as it is less than half the side of the original square and allows for a box to be constructed. Thus, the maximum volume is achieved when ( x = 2 ) cm.Therefore, to maximize the volume of the box, the side length x of the small squares that are cut out should be:[ boxed{x = 2  text{cm}} ]"},{"problem":"4.

Therefore, comparing this with the given asymptote equations:pm frac{3}{2}x = pm frac{b}{a}x.By substitution, we find that:frac{b}{a} = frac{3}{2}.Since we know that a = 3, we can solve for b:b = frac{3}{2}a = frac{3}{2} cdot 3 = frac{9}{2}.Therefore, b^2 = left(frac{9}{2}right)^2 = frac{81}{4}.Consequently, we have the equation of the hyperbola:frac{x^2}{3^2} - frac{y^2}{left(frac{9}{2}right)^2} = frac{x^2}{9} - frac{y^2}{frac{81}{4}} = 1.Hence, the equation of the hyperbola with foci on the X-axis, a distance between vertices of 6, and asymptote equations y = pm frac{3}{2}x is:boxed{frac{x^2}{9} - frac{y^2}{frac{81}{4}} = 1}."},{"problem":"20.

Since |AB| leqslant 1, |BD| leqslant 1, points A, D should be within the circle centered at point B with a radius of 1. Also, since |CA| leqslant 1, |CD| leqslant 1, points A, D should be within the circle centered at point C with a radius of 1. Thus, points A, D should be in the intersection of these two circles.

Understanding the Problem:   We are given ( n ) real numbers ( a_1, a_2, ldots, a_n ). We need to find the largest possible number of nonempty subsets of these numbers such that the sum of the elements in each subset is equal to 1.2. Analyzing Subsets:   There are ( 2^n ) subsets of ( n ) elements, including the empty subset. Since we are only interested in nonempty subsets, we have ( 2^n - 1 ) nonempty subsets.3. Considering the Sum of Subsets:   If all elements ( a_i ) are zero, then the sum of any subset is zero. Therefore, no subset can have a sum of 1 in this case.4. Introducing a Nonzero Element:   Suppose at least one element ( x_0 ) is nonzero. We need to consider subsets that include ( x_0 ) and those that do not.5. Subsets Including ( x_0 ):   If a subset ( S ) with sum 1 contains ( x_0 ), then the sum of the subset ( S setminus {x_0} ) (the subset without ( x_0 )) must be ( 1 - x_0 ).6. Subsets Excluding ( x_0 ):   If a subset ( S ) with sum 1 does not contain ( x_0 ), then adding ( x_0 ) to this subset will result in a sum ( ne 1 ).7. Counting Subsets:   The number of subsets with sum 1 is at most half of the total number of nonempty subsets. This is because for each subset with sum 1, there is a corresponding subset (by adding or removing ( x_0 )) that does not sum to 1.8. Maximum Number of Subsets with Sum 1:   Therefore, the maximum number of subsets with sum 1 is ( le frac{2^n - 1}{2} ). Simplifying, we get:   [   frac{2^n - 1}{2} = 2^{n-1} - frac{1}{2}   ]   Since the number of subsets must be an integer, we take the floor function:   [   leftlfloor 2^{n-1} - frac{1}{2} rightrfloor = 2^{n-1}   ]9. Achieving the Maximum:   To achieve this maximum, consider the set ( {1, 0, 0, ldots, 0} ). Here, the number of subsets with sum 1 is exactly ( 2^{n-1} ), as each subset containing the element 1 and any combination of zeros will sum to 1.Conclusion:[boxed{2^{n-1}}]"},{"problem":"Given the function f(x)=Asin (omega x+varphi )+h (A > 0,omega > 0,|varphi| < pi).

Let's mark the numbers 17, 19, 23, and 29, spending four rubles. Then mark the number 2, spending another ruble.

In any way of solving the problem, the prime numbers 17, 19, 23, and 29, which exceed 15, will have to be marked for money, as they are not divisors or multiples of any numbers on the board.

We need to find the probability that ( x > y ) where ( x ) is uniformly chosen from the interval ([0,1]) and ( y ) is uniformly chosen from the interval ([-1,1]).2.

The variable ( y ) can be in the interval ([0,1]) with probability (frac{1-0}{1-(-1)} = frac{1}{2}). This is because the length of the interval ([0,1]) is 1, and the length of the interval ([-1,1]) is 2.4. If ( y ) is in the interval ([0,1]), we can visualize the problem in a unit square with vertices at ((0,0)), ((0,1)), ((1,0)), and ((1,1)).5.

Let X_{0} be the random variable \\"the number of shots needed to reduce the number of arrows by one.\\" Ivan makes a shot. Consider the random variable - the indicator I of a successful shot.

ThenX_{0}=(1-I) cdot 1+I cdotleft(1+X_{1}+X_{2}+X_{3}right)where X_{1}, X_{2}, and X_{3} are the same random variables as X_{0}. Each of them equals the number of shots needed to reduce the number of arrows in reserve by one after receiving three new arrows from the Princess.The variable I is only related to the nearest shot, while the variables X_{k} for k=1,2,3 are only related to subsequent shots. Therefore, the random variables I and X_{k} are independent. We will transition to expectations in the obtained equality:mathrm{E} X_{0}=(1-mathrm{E} I)+mathrm{E} I cdotleft(1+mathrm{E} X_{1}+mathrm{E} X_{2}+mathrm{E} X_{3}right)Since all variables from X_{0} to X_{3} are identically distributed, their expectations are equal.

Determine how many fewer arrows Ivan has as a result of the k-th shot (taking into account the new ones given by the Princess). Let this random variable be X_{k} ( k=1,2,3, ldots ).

That is,X_{k} simleft(begin{array}{cc}1 & -2 0.9 & 0.1end{array}right)independently of k.

This proposition is also correct because negating a universal quantifier results in an existential quantifier with the negated predicate.③ The proposition \\"p vee q\\" (read as \\"p or q\\") being true does not necessarily imply that both p and q are true. In logical disjunction, it is sufficient for one of the propositions to be true. Therefore, this statement is incorrect.④ The statement \\"x > 3\\" being a sufficient condition for \\"x^2-3x+2 > 0\\" means if x > 3 is true, then x^2-3x+2 > 0 must also be true. However, it's not a necessary condition because x^2-3x+2 > 0 can also be true for some values of x that are not greater than 3. The proposition is correct.⑤ In triangle ABC, if A > B, then sin A > sin B. This statement is generally true in a triangle where angles are between 0 and pi radians (or 0 and 180 degrees), as the sine function is increasing in this range. However, for obtuse angles, this statement would not hold, but since triangle internal angles are always acute or right, the proposition is correct. After reviewing all the propositions, we find that ①, ②, ④, and ⑤ are correct, while ③ is incorrect. Therefore, there are 4 correct propositions.Hence, the final answer is boxed{D} (4 correct propositions)."},{"problem":"A set of data is given: 1, 4, 3, 2, 5, x.

Therefore, one of them is divisible by 2 but not by 4, and the other is divisible by 4. Hence:   [   v_2(k - 1) + v_2(k + 1) = 1 + 2 = 3   ]   Thus, applying the LTE lemma:   [   v_2(k^m - 1) = 3 + v_2(m) - 1 = 2 + v_2(m)   ]3.

Complementary Events: Two events are complementary if the occurrence of one event means the other cannot occur. Since event A (the first coin is heads up) and event B (the second coin is tails up) can both occur simultaneously (for example, if the outcome is heads for the first coin and tails for the second), they are not complementary.2.

Given that both A and B can occur together (as illustrated in the scenario where the first coin shows heads and the second shows tails), they are not mutually exclusive.3. Independent Events: Two events are independent if the occurrence of one does not affect the occurrence of the other. In this case, the result of the first coin flip does not influence the result of the second coin flip, making A and B independent events. This aligns with option C.4.

The number of students studying English in the second group is four times less than in the first group. What is the minimum possible number of students in one group?","solution":"4. Let the number of people studying French in the first group be x, then in the second group it is 3x. Let the number of people studying English in the second group be y, then in the first group it is 4y. The total number of people in the first group is x+4y-5, and in the second group it is 3x+y-5. By equating these values, we get 3y=2x, from which it follows that y is an even number. Note also that y leq 5, since if 5 people study two languages, then at least five people study English. From this, it follows that the minimum value of y=6, then x=9, and the total number of students in one group is x+4y-5=9+24-5=28 students.Answer: 28 students."},{"problem":"Evaluate int_{2}^{4}(frac{1}{x} + x)dx = boxed{text{answer}}.","solution":"Solution: int_{2}^{4}(frac{1}{x} + x)dx = (ln x + frac{1}{2}x^2)|_{2}^{4} = ln 4 + 8 - ln 2 - 2 = ln 2 + 6.Hence, the answer is boxed{ln 2 + 6}.According to the rules for calculating definite integrals, we can compute the answer directly.

(1) When n=3, a tournament result can be constructed as shown in Figure 4, which clearly meets the requirements.(2) When n=4, assume there exists a tournament result such that each player is not inferior to any other player. It is evident that no player can defeat all others (otherwise, the others cannot be not inferior to him), nor can any player lose to all others (otherwise, he cannot be not inferior to the others).If each player defeats 1 or 2 others, suppose player A defeats B and D, and loses to C. Then, B and D must both defeat C (otherwise, they cannot be not inferior to A). Thus, the loser between B and D (who only defeated C) cannot be not inferior to the winner (who defeated C and the opponent).Therefore, when n=4, there does not exist a tournament result that meets the requirements.(3) When n=6, a tournament result can be constructed as shown in Figure 5.(4) If there exists a tournament result for n players where each player is not inferior to any other player, let the tournament result be represented by graph G.

Consider the colorings of a 5 times 5 table described in the problem (i.e., such that in each column and each row exactly one cell is colored).For convenience, let's introduce some notations.

Suppose that among the colorings of the first table, exactly a have the cell A colored, and exactly b have the cell B colored. Clearly, a=b due to symmetry.Notice that the number of colorings of the second table is equal to the number of colorings of the first table where the cell A is not colored. The number of colorings of the third table is equal to the number of colorings of the first table where neither A nor B is colored. To find this, we subtract from 120 the number of colorings of the first table where A or B is colored. To count the number of such colorings, we add a and b, and then subtract what has been counted twice - the ways where both A and B are colored.All colorings of the first table can be divided into two types: those in which the cell A is colored, and those in which it is not.

Conversely, if 2 q+p is divisible by 2, then 2 q-p is also divisible by 2. But 22 contains only one factor of 2, so it cannot be that both 2 q-p and 2 q+p are divisible by 2. We conclude that 2 q-p and 2 q+p are precisely odd, and c is therefore even. Finally, since p geq 0 and q geq 1, we have 2 q+p geq 2, so the factor 11 from 22 must be in 2 q+p. We conclude that there are only two possibilities:- c=2,2 q+p=11,2 q-p=1;- c=-2,2 q+p=11,2 q-p=-1.In the first case, we find 2 p=11-1=10, so p=5 and q=3. This gives 4 n-2=50, so n=13. Checking: frac{4 n-2}{n+5}=frac{50}{18}=frac{25}{9}=frac{5^{2}}{3^{2}}, so n=13 indeed satisfies. In the second case, we find 2 p=11--1=12, so p=6, but then q cannot be an integer anymore, so this case is invalid. We conclude that there is exactly one solution, and that is n=13."},{"problem":"11.

As t^2 = 1 - 2sin xcos x, we have sin xcos x = dfrac{1 - t^2}{2}.The function g(x) can now be expressed as[h(t) = left(-frac{3}{2}right)(1 - t^2) + kt - k^2 = frac{3}{2}t^2 + kt - frac{3}{2} - k^2,]where the axis of symmetry is at t = -dfrac{k}{3}.Case 1: If k > 3sqrt{2}, then g(x)_{min} = h(-sqrt{2}) = -k^2 - sqrt{2}k + frac{3}{2}. From -k^2 - sqrt{2}k + frac{3}{2} = -frac{3}{2}, we can solve for k, obtaining k^2 + sqrt{2}k - 3 = 0.This quadratic has solutions k = dfrac{-sqrt{2} pm sqrt{14}}{2}. However, since we need k > 3sqrt{2}, there is no solution in this case.Case 2: If -3sqrt{2} leq k leq 3sqrt{2}, the minimum of g(x) is g(x)_{min} = hleft(-dfrac{k}{3}right) = -frac{7k^2}{6} - frac{3}{2}.Setting this equal to -frac{3}{2} yields k = 0, which is within the interval [-3sqrt{2}, 3sqrt{2}].Case 3: If k < -3sqrt{2}, then g(x)_{min} = h(sqrt{2}) = -k^2 + sqrt{2}k + frac{3}{2}.Setting -k^2 + sqrt{2}k + frac{3}{2} = -frac{3}{2}, we solve for k to get k^2 - sqrt{2}k - 3 = 0.The solutions are k = dfrac{sqrt{2} pm sqrt{14}}{2}, but since we need k < -3sqrt{2}, there is again no solution in this case.Therefore, the only valid case is when k = 0, which leads to g(x) having the minimum value of -dfrac{3}{2}.[boxed{k = 0}]"},{"problem":"For real number x, if and only if n leqslant x < n+1, where n in mathbb{N}^*, then [x] = n.

For k=2017.Solution. First, we prove that k>2016. Suppose the teacher used some k leqslant 2016, thinking of the polynomial P(x). Consider the polynomial Q(x)=P(x)+(x-n_{1})(x-n_{2}) ldots(x-n_{k}). Note that the degree of the polynomial Q(x) is also 2017, and its leading coefficient is also 1. Moreover, Pleft(n_{1}right) Pleft(n_{2}right) ldots Pleft(n_{k}right)=Qleft(n_{1}right) Qleft(n_{2}right) ldots Qleft(n_{k}right), but P(x) neq Q(x). Therefore, the children could have found the polynomial Q(x) instead of P(x), meaning the teacher did not achieve the required result.It remains to prove that for k=2017 the teacher can come up with the required problem.Lemma. Let P(x) be a polynomial with integer coefficients, and let a and b be different integers. Then P(a)-P(b) is divisible by a-b.Proof. In the difference P(a)-P(b), we group the terms by powers: if P(x)=p_{n} x^{n}+p_{n-1} x^{n-1}+ldots+p_{1} x+p_{0}, then P(a)-P(b)=p_{n}left(a^{n}-b^{n}right)+p_{n-1}left(a^{n-1}-b^{n-1}right)+ldots+p_{1}(a-b), where each term is divisible by a-b.Let k=2017. Set n_{i}=4 i for i=1,2, ldots, k; suppose the teacher tells the children that Pleft(n_{1}right) Pleft(n_{2}right) ldots Pleft(n_{k}right)=1. Then the polynomial P(x)=left(x-n_{1}right)left(x-n_{2}right) ldotsleft(x-n_{k}right)+1 fits the condition. Suppose there is another polynomial Q(x) that also fits the condition. Then, since Qleft(n_{1}right) Qleft(n_{2}right) ldots Qleft(n_{k}right)=1 and the coefficients of the polynomial Q(x) are integers, Qleft(n_{i}right)= pm 1 for any i=1,2, ldots, k.If there exist i and j such that Qleft(n_{i}right)=1 and Qleft(n_{j}right)=-1, then the difference Qleft(n_{i}right)-Qleft(n_{j}right)=2 is not divisible by n_{i}-n_{j}, which contradicts the lemma. Therefore, all values Qleft(n_{i}right) are equal to each other and are all either 1 or -1. However, all values cannot be -1, because in the product Qleft(n_{1}right) Qleft(n_{2}right) ldots Qleft(n_{k}right) there are an odd number of factors and the product would be -1. Thus, Qleft(n_{i}right)=1 for any i=1,2, ldots, k.

According to the definition of a hyperbola, the difference in distances of any point on a hyperbola to the foci is constant and equal to 2a, where a is the semi-major axis length of the hyperbola.So, we have the following equation that represents the definition of a hyperbola for point A(4, -5):2a = sqrt{(4 - 0)^2 + (-5 - (-3))^2} - sqrt{(4 - 0)^2 + (-5 - 3)^2}Simplifying, we obtain:2a = sqrt{4^2 + (-2)^2} - sqrt{4^2 + (-8)^2}2a = sqrt{16 + 4} - sqrt{16 + 64}2a = sqrt{20} - sqrt{80}2a = 2sqrt{5} - 4sqrt{5}2a = -2sqrt{5}However, since 2a represents a length, we take the absolute value:2a = 2sqrt{5}This implies thata = sqrt{5}Now, we know that for the hyperbola the relationship between a, b, and c is c^2 = a^2 + b^2, where c is the distance from the center of the hyperbola to one of the foci, and b is the semi-minor axis length of the hyperbola.Given that c = 3, we can find b using the Pythagorean relationship:b = sqrt{c^2 - a^2}b = sqrt{3^2 - (sqrt{5})^2}b = sqrt{9 - 5}b = sqrt{4}b = 2Therefore, the standard equation of the required hyperbola, centered at the origin with the transverse axis along the y-axis and the conjugate axis along the x-axis, is:frac{y^2}{a^2} - frac{x^2}{b^2} = 1Where a^2 = 5 and b^2 = 4.

Understanding the Problem:   We need to find the smallest positive integer ( k ) such that any subset ( A ) of ( S = {1, 2, ldots, 2012} ) with ( |A| = k ) contains three elements ( x, y, z ) such that ( x = a + b ), ( y = b + c ), and ( z = c + a ) for distinct integers ( a, b, c ) in ( S ).2. Solving the Equations:   By solving the equations ( x = a + b ), ( y = b + c ), and ( z = c + a ), we get:   [   c = frac{y + z - x}{2}, quad b = frac{x + y - z}{2}, quad a = frac{x + z - y}{2}   ]   We need ( a, b, c ) to be distinct integers.

Similarly, ( c = a ) and ( a = b ) lead to contradictions. Hence, ( a, b, c ) are distinct.3. Conditions for ( a, b, c ):   Since ( 1 leq x, y, z leq 2012 ), we need ( 1 leq a, b, c leq 2012 ). Also, ( a, b, c ) are integers if ( x + y + z equiv 0 pmod{2} ).4. Finding the Maximum Set:   We need to find the maximum set such that we cannot pick three elements ( x < y < z ) such that ( x + y + z ) is even and ( x + y > z ). Consider the set ( A = {1, 2, 3, 5, 7, ldots, 2011} ), which contains all odd numbers. This set does not work because we cannot make ( x + y + z ) even.5. Size of the Set:   The set ( A ) has ( 1007 ) elements, so ( k geq 1008 ). We need to show that ( k = 1008 ) is the minimum.6. Analyzing Even and Odd Elements:   Suppose there are ( a ) odd numbers in ( A ) where ( |A| = 1008 ) and ( 1008 - a ) even elements. If there are at least ( 100 ) even elements ( a_1 < a_2 < ldots < a_{100} ), then:   [   a_{100} - a_1 leq 2010   ]   There exists some ( k ) such that ( a_{k+1} - a_k leq 21 ). Since the difference is even, ( a_{k+1} - a_k leq 20 ).7. Finding Differences:   We can find another difference less than ( 20 ). If ( frac{2010 - 20z}{99 - z} < 22 ), we can show there exist ( z ) differences ( leq 20 ). This holds for ( z < 84 ), so we can find ( 83 ) differences ( leq 20 ).8. Choosing Triplets:   Let the difference with the greatest index be ( k ). Then ( a_{k+1} - a_k leq 20 ) and ( a_k geq 186 ). Choose ( a_j < a_k < a_{k+1} ) as our triplet ( x, y, z ).9. Odd Numbers Analysis:   There are at least ( 908 ) odd numbers ( b_1 < b_2 < ldots < b_{908} ). We can find some ( j ) such that ( b_{j+1} - b_j = 2 ). Using a similar approach, we can find ( 808 ) elements differing by ( 2 ).10. Final Triplet:    Since ( |A| = 1008 ), ( A ) has at least ( 2 ) even elements. Thus, it contains an even number ( a geq 4 ). The triplet ( a, b_j, b_{j+1} ) works.Therefore, ( k geq 1008 ) and ( k leq 1008 ), hence ( k = 1008 ) is the minimum ( k ).The final answer is ( boxed{1008} )"},{"problem":"2.

Express (a) in terms of (b):   Since (a - b geq 2), we can write (a = b + k) for some (k geq 2). Therefore, (2(a - b) = 2k).2. Consider the case when (b geq 3):   - For (b geq 3), we have (p_b geq 5).   - Since two primes cannot be consecutive, the difference between any two primes (p_a) and (p_b) must be at least 2. Therefore, (p_a - p_b geq 2k).3. Divisibility condition:   - We need (p_a - p_b) to divide (2(a - b) = 2k).   - This implies (p_a - p_b leq 2k) because (p_a - p_b) must be a divisor of (2k).4. Equality condition:   - Combining the inequalities, we get (p_a - p_b = 2k).   - This means the sequence (p_b, p_{b+1}, ldots, p_{b+k}) forms an arithmetic progression (AP) with a common difference of 2.5. Impossibility of AP with common difference 2 for (b geq 3):   - For (p_b geq 5) and (k geq 2), such an AP is not possible because one of the terms in the sequence would be divisible by 3, which contradicts the property of primes (except for the prime 3 itself).6.

The numbers marked on the inner arc segments of the circle represent the number of arc segments contained in that arc.We now verify that such an A=left{A_{1}, A_{2}, cdots, A_{15}right} meets the problem's requirements.(i) Clearly, each set in A consists of exactly 7 elements of S.(ii) If 1 leqslant j-i leqslant 7, then rotating A_{i} clockwise by j-i arc segments results in A_{j}.Analyzing the diagram of A_{1} (Figure (b)), we see that there are exactly three pairs of elements in A_{1} that are separated by 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 arc segments, respectively. Each A_{i} has the same property. Rotating A_{i} clockwise by j-i arc segments (1 leqslant j-i leqslant 7), exactly three elements of A_{i} will move to positions where the elements are still in A_{i}, thus left|A_{i} cap A_{j}right|=3.If 8 leqslant j-i leqslant 14, then rotating A_{j} clockwise by 15-(j-i) arc segments results in A_{i}. Similarly, we can conclude that left|A_{i} cap A_{j}right|=3.(iii) Let M={u, v, w} be any three-element subset of S'. Without loss of generality, assume u, v, w are arranged in a clockwise direction on the circle. Consider the number of arc segments between u and v, v and w, and v and u in the clockwise direction, and denote the pair of the smaller two numbers of these arc segments as (a, b) (in clockwise order). We will classify the three-element subsets of S based on these pairs. Clearly, 1 leqslant a, b leqslant 7, and except for the pair (5,5), all other pairs (a, b) satisfy a+b leqslant 9.Observing the diagram of A_{1}, we see that each type of (a, b) pair appears exactly once in A_{1}:begin{array}{l}(1,1),(1,2),(2,1),(1,3),(3,1),(1,4),(4,1),(1,5), (5,1),(1,6),(6,1),(1,7),(7,1) ; (2,2),(2,3),(3,2),(2,4),(4,2),(2,5),(5,2),(2,6), (6,2),(2,7),(7,2) ; (3,3),(3,4),(4,3),(3,5),(5,3),(3,6),(6,3),(3,7), (7,3),(4,4),(4,5),(5,4),(5,5) .end{array}Accordingly, any three-element subset M of S is contained in at least one set in the family A (in fact, in exactly one set in the family A).In summary, the minimum value of n is 15.!Note: The proof of this problem is not too difficult, utilizing the technique of double counting; however, constructing the example is more challenging."},{"problem":"In a scene from the movie \\"The Da Vinci Code,\\" the female protagonist wants to enter a password consisting of ten digits.

We need to find all positive integers ( N ) that are perfect squares and whose decimal representation consists of ( n ) digits equal to 2 and one digit equal to 5, where ( n ) is a positive integer.2. Let ( N ) be represented as ( 22cdots 25 ), where the number of digits equal to 2 is ( n ) and there is one digit equal to 5. Thus, ( N ) has ( n+1 ) digits in total.3. We can express ( N ) as:   [   N = 2 times 10^n + 2 times 10^{n-1} + cdots + 2 times 10 + 5   ]4. This can be rewritten using the formula for the sum of a geometric series:   [   N = 2 left( frac{10^{n+1} - 1}{9} right) times 10 + 5   ]5. Simplifying the expression:   [   N = frac{2(10^{n+1} - 1)}{9} times 10 + 5 = frac{20 times 10^{n+1} - 20 + 45}{9} = frac{2 times 10^{n+2} + 25}{9}   ]6. For ( N ) to be a perfect square, the expression ( frac{2 times 10^{n+2} + 25}{9} ) must be a perfect square. Therefore:   [   2 times 10^{n+2} + 25 = 9k^2 quad text{for some integer } k   ]7.

What is the smallest positive integer that satisfies these properties?","solution":"Solution 1: Let x be the number sought. Observe that x+2 is divisible by 3, 4, 5, and 6. The least common multiple of these numbers is 60. Therefore, x+2=60k, so x=58.Solution 2: Let x be the number sought. The remainder of the division of x by 3 is 1. Therefore, x is of the form x=3a+1, with a geq 0 an integer. Next, we want to determine what form a must take for x=3a+1 to leave a remainder of 2 when divided by 4, that is, for 3a to leave a remainder of 1 when divided by 4. What must be the remainder of the division of a by 4? On the one hand, if this remainder is 3, then a is of the form a=4b+3, from which it follows that 3a=12b+9=4 cdot (3b+2)+1 indeed leaves a remainder of 1 when divided by 4. On the other hand, we can verify that any other remainder would not work. For example, if a left a remainder of 2 when divided by 4, we would have a=4b'+2 and 3a=12b'+6=4 cdot (3b'+1)+2 would leave a remainder of 2 and not 1 when divided by 4.Substituting a=4b+3 into x=3a+1, we get x=12b+10. We now use the fact that x leaves a remainder of 3 when divided by 5. Since 10 is a multiple of 5, 12b also leaves a remainder of 3 when divided by 5. But 12b=10b+2b and 10b is a multiple of 5. Therefore, 2b leaves a remainder of 3 when divided by 5. Then, b leaves a remainder of 4 when divided by 5. Indeed, on the one hand, if b=5c+4, then 2b=10c+8=5 cdot (2c+1)+3 does indeed leave a remainder of 3 when divided by 5. On the other hand, as above, we can verify that 4 is the only remainder that works. Therefore, b=5c+4 and x=12b+10=12 cdot (5c+4)+10=60c+58.

First, consider the inequality ( |x_i| < 1 ). This implies that the sum of the absolute values of ( x_i ) is strictly less than ( n ):   [   |x_1| + |x_2| + dots + |x_n| < n.   ]3. Given the equation:   [   |x_1| + |x_2| + dots + |x_n| = 19 + |x_1 + x_2 + dots + x_n|,   ]   we can denote ( S = x_1 + x_2 + dots + x_n ). Thus, the equation becomes:   [   |x_1| + |x_2| + dots + |x_n| = 19 + |S|.   ]4. Since ( |x_1| + |x_2| + dots + |x_n| < n ), we have:   [   19 + |S| < n.   ]5. To satisfy the equation, we need:   [   n > 19 + |S|.   ]6. The maximum value of ( |S| ) occurs when the sum of ( x_i ) is maximized in absolute value. Given ( |x_i| < 1 ), the maximum possible value of ( |S| ) is ( n cdot frac{1}{2} ) when ( x_i ) are chosen to be as close to 1 and -1 as possible while maintaining the constraint ( |x_i| < 1 ).7. However, for simplicity, let's consider the case where ( S = 0 ). This simplifies our equation to:   [   |x_1| + |x_2| + dots + |x_n| = 19.   ]8. If ( n leq 19 ), then:   [   |x_1| + |x_2| + dots + |x_n| < n leq 19,   ]   which contradicts the given equation. Therefore, ( n ) must be greater than 19.9. Now, let's test ( n = 20 ). If ( n = 20 ), we need to find ( x_i ) such that:   [   |x_1| + |x_2| + dots + |x_{20}| = 19 + |x_1 + x_2 + dots + x_{20}|.   ]10. Consider the construction ( x_i = frac{19}{20} cdot (-1)^i ) (alternating negative and positive ( frac{19}{20} )). Then:    [    |x_1| + |x_2| + dots + |x_{20}| = 20 cdot frac{19}{20} = 19,    ]    and    [    x_1 + x_2 + dots + x_{20} = 0.    ]11. This satisfies the equation:    [    19 = 19 + |0|.    ]12.

Starting with the given condition, b+bcos A=acos B. This can be interpreted using trigonometric identities.2. Applying the Law of Sines, we can express sides in terms of angles, yielding sin B+sin Bcos A=sin Acos B.3. Simplifying, this equation becomes sin B=sin(A-B). Given the domain of A and A-B as Ain(0,frac{pi}{2}) and A-Bin(-frac{pi}{2},frac{pi}{2}) respectively, we find that B=A-B, leading to the conclusion that A=2B.Therefore, boxed{A} is correct.4. Considering A=2B and the restrictions of an acute triangle, where 0<A, B, C<frac{pi}{2}, we derive that 0<2B<frac{pi}{2}, implying 0<B<frac{pi}{4}. Additionally, since A+B+C=pi, we have 0<pi-3B<frac{pi}{2}, further refining the bounds of B to frac{pi}{6}<B<frac{pi}{4}.Hence, boxed{B} is correct.5. Applying the Law of Sines again, frac{a}{b}=frac{sin A}{sin B}=frac{sin 2B}{sin B}=2cos B. Given the bounds of B as frac{pi}{6}<B<frac{pi}{4}, we find that frac{a}{b}in(sqrt{3}, 2), not (1, sqrt{2}), making option C incorrect.6. Finally, considering A=2B, we use trigonometric identities to express sin A=2sin Bcos B. Converting these relationships to sides with the Law of Sines and the Law of Cosines, we find that a^{2}c=a^{2}b+c^{2}b-b^{3}. Rearranging gives a^{2}(c-b)=b(c^{2}-b^{2})=b(c+b)(c-b). Since bneq c (as b=c would make triangle ABC a right triangle, which contradicts the acute nature of the triangle), we conclude that a^{2}=b(c+b)=b^{2}+bc.Thus, boxed{D} is correct.Therefore, the correct options are boxed{ABD}."},{"problem":"18 cdot 107 Line H K and B C are in the same plane, M is the midpoint of segment B C, B H and C K are perpendicular to H K.

(b) 6.Solution. (a) Since the graph of G(x) is symmetric with respect to the line x=-8, the points at which it takes the same value must be divided into pairs of symmetric points, except possibly one point that lies on the axis of symmetry. Therefore, the middle of the five given points should lie on the axis of symmetry, i.e., x_{3}=-8. The first and fifth points should be symmetric with respect to the line x=-8, so x_{1}+x_{5}=2 cdot(-8)=-16. Therefore, x_{1}+x_{3}+x_{5}=-24.(b) Consider the auxiliary polynomial F(x)=G(x-8)-2022. Clearly, the degree of F(x) coincides with the degree of G(x). The graph of F(x) is obtained by a parallel shift of the graph of G(x) 8 units to the right and 2022 units down. Then this graph is symmetric with respect to the line x=0, and at five points F(x) takes the value 0. It is clear that F(x) has exactly 5 distinct roots, so its degree is at least 5. On the other hand, since the graph of F(x) is symmetric with respect to the line x=0, the function F(x) is even, so the degree of F(x) is also even. Therefore, the degree of F(x), and hence the degree of G(x), is at least 6.As an example of a polynomial of degree 6, we can take F(x)=(x+2)(x+1)x^{2}(x-1)(x-2).

Since in each row the number of yellow cells is not less than the number of red cells, the same is true for the entire table. Therefore, the number of yellow and red cells is the same in each column. Indeed, if in one of the columns the number of yellow cells is less than the number of red cells, then there will be fewer of them in the entire table, since in the other columns their number is not greater than the number of red cells. Moreover, the number of red cells in each column is not less than frac{5}{3}, that is, it is at least 2. Thus, the table contains at least 10 red cells and the same number of yellow cells. Therefore, there are no more than 5 blue cells in the table. On the other hand, in each column the total number of yellow and red cells is even, so there is at least one blue cell in each column.

The Malingshan Scenic Area is a 4A-rated tourist attraction in our city. The scenic area has developed a souvenir that costs 30 yuan to produce and is sold. The selling price is set not to be lower than the cost and not higher than 54 yuan. After selling for a period of time, it was found that when the product was priced at 40 yuan, 80 units could be sold per day. Furthermore, for every 1 yuan increase in the selling price, the daily sales volume would decrease by 2 units. If the goal is to make a profit of 1200 yuan per day from selling this product, please determine the selling price at that time.","solution":"To solve this problem, let's denote the selling price of the souvenir as x yuan. Based on the information given, we can establish the relationship between the selling price, the number of units sold, and the profit.1. Establish the profit equation: The profit for each unit sold is (x - 30) yuan, since it costs 30 yuan to produce each souvenir. When the selling price is 40 yuan, 80 units are sold. For every 1 yuan increase in the selling price above 40 yuan, the number of units sold decreases by 2. Therefore, if the selling price is x yuan, the number of units sold is 80 - 2(x - 40).2. Set up the equation based on the desired profit: The goal is to achieve a profit of 1200 yuan per day. The profit can be calculated as the profit per unit times the number of units sold, which gives us the equation:   [   (x - 30) cdot [80 - 2(x - 40)] = 1200   ]3. Simplify the equation: Let's simplify the equation step by step:   [   (x - 30) cdot (80 - 2x + 80) = 1200   ]   [   (x - 30) cdot (160 - 2x) = 1200   ]   [   160x - 2x^2 - 4800 + 60x = 1200   ]   [   -2x^2 + 220x - 4800 = 1200   ]   [   -2x^2 + 220x - 6000 = 0   ]   [   x^2 - 110x + 3000 = 0   ]4.

Determine the valid selling price: Since the selling price must be between the cost of production (30 yuan) and 54 yuan, and considering the problem's constraints, x_{2} = 60 yuan is not a valid solution because it exceeds the maximum selling price limit. Therefore, the valid selling price is x_{1} = 50 yuan.Thus, to achieve a profit of 1200 yuan per day from selling this product, the selling price should be boxed{50} yuan."},{"problem":"8.143. cos 4 x+2 cos ^{2} x=1.8.143. cos 4 x+2 cos ^{2} x=1.","solution":"## Solution.We havebegin{aligned}& cos 2(2 x)+2 cos ^{2} x-1=0, Leftrightarrow 2 cos ^{2} 2 x-1+cos 2 x=0 & 2 cos ^{2} 2 x+cos 2 x-1=0end{aligned}Solving this equation as a quadratic in terms of cos 2 x, we find (cos 2 x)_{1}=-1, 2 x_{1}=pi+2 pi k, x_{1}=frac{pi}{2}+pi k, k in mathbb{Z}; (cos 2 x)_{2}=frac{1}{2}, 2 x_{2}= pm frac{pi}{3}+2 pi n, x_{2}= pm frac{pi}{6}+pi n, n in mathbb{Z}.

Define the problem in terms of combinatorics:   We need to minimize the number of triangles formed by connecting points within each group. The number of triangles formed by ( n_i ) points in the ( i )-th group is given by the binomial coefficient ( binom{n_i}{3} ).2. Express the total number of triangles:   The total number of triangles formed by all groups is:   [   sum_{i=1}^{10} binom{n_i}{3}   ]   where ( n_i ) is the number of points in the ( i )-th group.3. Simplify the binomial coefficient:   Recall that:   [   binom{n_i}{3} = frac{n_i (n_i - 1) (n_i - 2)}{6}   ]4. Use the constraint that the total number of points is 100:   [   sum_{i=1}^{10} n_i = 100   ]5. Apply the inequality for minimizing the sum of binomial coefficients:   Using the convexity of the function ( binom{n_i}{3} ), the sum ( sum_{i=1}^{10} binom{n_i}{3} ) is minimized when the ( n_i ) values are as equal as possible. Given that each group must have at least 3 points, the most balanced distribution is ( n_i = 10 ) for all ( i ).6. Calculate the number of triangles for this distribution:   If each group has 10 points:   [   binom{10}{3} = frac{10 cdot 9 cdot 8}{6} = 120   ]   Therefore, the total number of triangles is:   [   10 cdot 120 = 1200   ] Part (b)1. State the problem in terms of graph theory:   We need to show that there exists a way to color the edges of the complete graph formed by each group such that no triangle has all edges of the same color.2. Use Ramsey theory:   The Ramsey number ( R(3,3,3) ) is the smallest number such that any edge coloring of the complete graph ( K_n ) with 3 colors will contain a monochromatic triangle if ( n geq R(3,3,3) ). It is known that ( R(3,3,3) = 17 ).3. Apply the Ramsey number to our problem:   Since each group has 10 points and ( 10 < 17 ), it is possible to color the edges of each group with 3 colors such that no triangle is monochromatic.4. Conclude the proof:   Therefore, there exists an arrangement where each segment can be colored with one of three given colors, and no triangle has all edges of the same color.(blacksquare)The final answer is ( boxed{ 1200 } ) triangles for part (a) and the existence of a valid coloring for part (b)."},{"problem":"Let f(x) = xln x, if f'(x) = 2, then x =  ","solution":"Given f(x) = xln x,  Therefore, f'(x) = ln x + 1.

Instead, we focus on the line x-y+2=0 itself, which is related to the condition c-d+2=0.The expression (a-c)^2+(b-d)^2 represents the square of the distance between points on the curve y = f(x) = frac{ln x}{x} and the line x-y+2=0.To find the minimum distance, we first analyze the function f(x) = frac{ln x}{x}. Its derivative is:f'(x) = frac{1-ln x}{x^2}For x > 0, we observe that:- When 0  0, indicating f(x) is monotonically increasing.- When x > e, f'(x) < 0, indicating f(x) is monotonically decreasing.To find the line parallel to x-y+2=0 that is tangent to the curve y=f(x), we set f'(x_0) = 1 (since the slope of x-y+2=0 is 1). Solving f'(x_0) = frac{1-ln x_0}{x_0^2} = 1 gives x_0 = 1. Therefore, the point of tangency is (1, f(1)) = (1, 0).The distance d between the point of tangency (1, 0) and the line x-y+2=0 is calculated using the point-to-line distance formula:d = frac{|1*1 - 1*0 + 2|}{sqrt{1^2 + (-1)^2}} = frac{3}{sqrt{2}}Thus, the square of this distance, which represents the minimum value of (a-c)^2+(b-d)^2, is:left(frac{3}{sqrt{2}}right)^2 = frac{9}{2}Therefore, the correct answer is boxed{text{B}}."},{"problem":"Given that the angle between vector overrightarrow{b} and unit vector overrightarrow{a} is 60^{circ}, and |{overrightarrow{a}-overrightarrow{b}}|=sqrt{7}, find |{overrightarrow{b}}|.","solution":"Given the information, let's break down the solution into detailed steps:1. First, we understand that since overrightarrow{a} is a unit vector, its magnitude is given by |overrightarrow{a}| = 1.2. We are also given that the angle between overrightarrow{b} and the unit vector overrightarrow{a} is 60^{circ}. This implies that the cosine of this angle, which we use in the dot product formula, is cos(60^{circ}) = frac{1}{2}.3. The problem states that the magnitude of the vector difference overrightarrow{a}-overrightarrow{b} is sqrt{7}. This can be expanded using the formula for the magnitude of a vector difference: |overrightarrow{a}-overrightarrow{b}|^2 = (overrightarrow{a}-overrightarrow{b}) cdot (overrightarrow{a}-overrightarrow{b}) = |overrightarrow{a}|^2 - 2overrightarrow{a}cdotoverrightarrow{b} + |overrightarrow{b}|^2.4. Substituting the given magnitudes and the relationship derived from the angle into the equation, we get 7 = 1^2 - 2cdot1cdot|overrightarrow{b}|cdotfrac{1}{2} + |overrightarrow{b}|^2.5. This equation simplifies to 7 = 1 - |overrightarrow{b}| + |overrightarrow{b}|^2. Rearranging it yields |overrightarrow{b}|^2 - |overrightarrow{b}| - 6 = 0.6. Solving this quadratic equation for |overrightarrow{b}|, we recognize it as a standard form quadratic equation ax^2 + bx + c = 0, where a = 1, b = -1, and c = -6. 7. Factoring or using the quadratic formula, we find that |overrightarrow{b}| has two possible values, but since |overrightarrow{b}| represents a magnitude and therefore must be positive, we select the positive value from the solutions.8. The solution to the equation |overrightarrow{b}|^2 - |overrightarrow{b}| - 6 = 0 that is positive is |overrightarrow{b}| = 3.Therefore, the magnitude of vector overrightarrow{b}, denoted as |overrightarrow{b}|, is boxed{3}."},{"problem":"5.

Given that point M is the midpoint, we denote it as (x_0, y_0) = (4, 1).Since A and B lie on the hyperbola, their coordinates satisfy the equation of the hyperbola, which gives us two equations:2x_1^2 - y_1^2 = 2 (1)2x_2^2 - y_2^2 = 2 (2)Subtracting equation (2) from equation (1) yields:2(x_1^2 - x_2^2) - (y_1^2 - y_2^2) = 0.This simplifies to:2(x_1 + x_2)(x_1 - x_2) - (y_1 + y_2)(y_1 - y_2) = 0.Using the midpoint formula (x_0, y_0) = left(frac{x_1 + x_2}{2}, frac{y_1 + y_2}{2}right), we can express x_1 + x_2 and y_1 + y_2 in terms of x_0 and y_0. Since (4,1) is the midpoint of A and B,x_1 + x_2 = 2x_0 = 2 cdot 4 = 8, andy_1 + y_2 = 2y_0 = 2 cdot 1 = 2.Substitute x_1 + x_2 = 8 and y_1 + y_2 = 2 back into the earlier equation:2(8)(x_1 - x_2) - (2)(y_1 - y_2) = 0.Since the quantities (x_1 - x_2) and (y_1 - y_2) represent the differences in x and y coordinates, respectively, they can be expressed in terms of the slope k of the line l connecting A and B, as (y_1 - y_2) = k(x_1 - x_2). Therefore, we have:2(8) - 2k = 0,which leads to:k = 8.The slope-point form of the line passing through point M with slope k is given by:y - y_0 = k(x - x_0).Substitute k = 8 and (x_0, y_0) = (4, 1) into this equation to find the equation of line l:y - 1 = 8(x - 4).Rearrange to get the equation in the standard form:8x - y - 31 = 0.Thus, the equation of line l is boxed{y = 8x - 31}."},{"problem":"Let i be the imaginary unit, and let the complex number z satisfy 1+zi=2i.

Understanding the Function's Behavior:   The function is of the form fleft(xright)=2^{t}, where t=x^{2}+4ax+2. We note that the function y=2^{t} is always increasing for all real numbers because the base of the exponent, 2, is greater than 1. Therefore, the monotonic behavior of f(x) on the interval left(-infty ,6right) depends solely on the behavior of the exponent t=x^{2}+4ax+2.2. Analyzing the Exponent t:   We let t=x^{2}+4ax+2 and recognize that the monotonicity of f(x) is determined by the monotonicity of t. For f(x) to be decreasing, t must be decreasing as well, because a decreasing exponent with a base greater than 1 will result in a decreasing function.3. Determining the Interval of Decrease for t:   The quadratic function t=x^{2}+4ax+2 is a parabola opening upwards (since the coefficient of x^2 is positive). This parabola is decreasing on the interval left(-infty, -2aright] because -2a is the x-coordinate of the vertex of the parabola, and to the left of this vertex, the function decreases.4. Relating the Intervals:   For f(x) to be monotonically decreasing on left(-infty ,6right), it is necessary that left(-infty ,6right)subseteq left(-infty ,-2aright]. This inclusion implies that the right endpoint of the interval for t to be decreasing, -2a, must be at least 6. In mathematical terms, this is expressed as -2ageqslant 6.5. Solving for a:   Solving the inequality -2ageqslant 6 for a, we get:   begin{align*}   -2a &geqslant 6    a &leqslant -3   end{align*}6. Conclusion:   Since a must be less than or equal to -3 for the function f(x) to be monotonically decreasing on the interval left(-infty ,6right), the correct answer is D: aleqslant -3.Therefore, the final answer, encapsulated as required, is boxed{D}."},{"problem":"The negation of the proposition \\"There exists an (x in mathbb{R}) such that (sin x > 1)\\" is (　　)A: There exists an (x in mathbb{R}) such that (sin x leqslant 1)B: For all (x in mathbb{R}), (sin x > 1)C: There exists an (x in mathbb{R}) such that (sin x = 1)D: For all (x in mathbb{R}), (sin x leqslant 1)","solution":"The proposition is an existential proposition, so the negation of the proposition is:  For all (x > 0), (sin x leqslant 1),  Therefore, the correct choice is: boxed{D}.

The process is as follows:  Solution: Let frac{y+z}{x}=frac{z+x}{y}=frac{x+y}{z}=k, then we have y+z=kx, z+x=ky, x+y=kz.  Adding the above three equations, we get 2left(x+y+zright)=kleft(x+y+zright).  Since x, y, z are all positive numbers,  Therefore, k=2, i.e., frac{y+z}{x}=2.  Therefore, 2x-y-z=0.

In this case, a_{n+2} = 1, a_{n+1} = 1, and a_n = 1. Thus, the ratio frac{a_{n+2}-a_{n+1}}{a_{n+1}-a_{n}} becomes frac{1-1}{1-1}, which is undefined due to division by zero. This contradicts the requirement for an arithmetic ratio sequence, where the ratio must be well-defined. Therefore, option A is incorrect.Option B: The common ratio of an arithmetic ratio sequence must not be 0If the common ratio k = 0, then frac{a_{n+2}-a_{n+1}}{a_{n+1}-a_{n}} = 0.

However, for the ratio frac{a_{n+3}-a_{n+2}}{a_{n+2}-a_{n+1}}, the denominator becomes 0, which is not permissible as it makes the ratio undefined. This shows that the common ratio cannot be 0, making option B correct.Option C: If a_{n}=-3^{n}+2, then the sequence {a_{n}} is an arithmetic ratio sequenceFor the sequence a_{n} = -3^n + 2, we calculate the ratio as follows:[frac{a_{n+2}-a_{n+1}}{a_{n+1}-a_{n}} = frac{(-3^{n+2}+2)-(-3^{n+1}+2)}{(-3^{n+1}+2)-(-3^{n}+2)} = frac{-3^{n+2}+3^{n+1}}{-3^{n+1}+3^{n}} = 3]This shows that the sequence has a constant ratio of 3, thus it is an arithmetic ratio sequence.

Then, a_{n+2} - a_{n+1} = d and a_{n+1} - a_{n} = d. The ratio is given by:[frac{a_{n+2}-a_{n+1}}{a_{n+1}-a_{n}} = frac{d}{d} = 1]This means that for any arithmetic sequence that is also an arithmetic ratio sequence, the common ratio must be 1, not 2.

Understanding the problem: We need to draw ( n-3 ) diagonals in an ( n )-gon such that no two diagonals intersect inside the polygon, and each triangle formed by these diagonals has at least one side that is a side of the ( n )-gon.2.

IV. o. t.)Remark. For the purpose of improving the first approximate values, the following reasoning based on intuition seems somewhat more precise. Our equation can be rewritten in the formx operatorname{tg} x-k=0Let a good approximate value of the root be x_{0}, i.e., x_{0} cdot operatorname{tg} x_{0}-k neq 0, but the absolute value of the left side left|x_{0} cdot operatorname{tg} x_{0}-kright|=left|d_{0}right| is small compared to the absolute values of the difference terms. Based on this, we seek an approximate value for the difference h between the root x and the approximate value x_{0}. From x-x_{0}=h we get x=x_{0}+h, which satisfies the equation, i.e.,left(x_{0}+hright) operatorname{tg}left(x_{0}+hright)-k=left(x_{0}+hright) cdot frac{operatorname{tg} x_{0}+operatorname{tg} h}{1-operatorname{tg} x_{0} cdot operatorname{tg} h}-k=0Removing the fraction, the equation can be rearranged as:begin{aligned}& left(x_{0} operatorname{tg} x_{0}-kright)+hleft(operatorname{tg} x_{0}+x_{0}+k operatorname{tg} x_{0}right)+ & +(operatorname{tg} h-h)left(x_{0}+k operatorname{tg} x_{0}right)+h cdot operatorname{tg} h=0end{aligned}The last two terms on the left can be neglected compared to the previous ones. It is known that the tangent of angles between 0^{circ} and 5^{circ} is approximately equal to their radian measure, so the factor (operatorname{tg} h-h) in the third term is small compared to the h in the second term (and the other factors in these two terms are also larger in the former), and the factors in the fourth term are expected to be small. Since d_{0} stands in the first parenthesis, the omitted terms of (2) are approximatelyh approx-frac{d_{0}}{x_{0}+(k+1) operatorname{tg} x_{0}}For example, in the case of k=0,5 and x_{0}=0,65=37,24^{circ}, operatorname{tg} x_{0}=0,7601, d_{0} approx 0,4941-0,5=-0,0059 (smaller than 2% of the difference terms), from which h approx 0,0033 and x_{1 / 2}^{prime}+h=0,6533, rounded to 0.653. (Thus h=0,19^{circ}, operatorname{tg} h=0,0033 and h cdot operatorname{tg} h approx 1,1 cdot 10^{-5}, indeed below the 10^{-4} error that can be made using the table.) sqrt{1}![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_05_02_bb5216d9ad64a8348e2fg-2.jpg?height=385&width=629&top_left_y=1846&top_left_x=737)[^0][^0]:    { }^{1} mathrm{According} to the school function table, the values of sin x and operatorname{tg} x rounded to 10^{-4} are still equal at x=2.6^{circ}.
