We will provide the answer in two steps, and as preparation, we will list the ways in which 8 fruits can be arranged on 4 identical plates, with 2 fruits on each.

We will denote the fruits by their initial letters.The possibilities for filling the first plate:a) a, b,B) a, s z,gamma ) a, kAnd in the alpha) case, the following 2 situations can be created on the first two plates:left.left.alpha_{1}right) quad a, b, quad b, s z ; quad alpha_{2}right) quad a, b, quad b, k.The former situation clearly leads to the arrangement in the following table (I), while the latter can be completed in two ways, because there are 2 each of k and s z left: by placing only one type of fruit on each of the last two plates, or mixed: (II) and (III). (For simplicity, we will no longer insert commas between the members of a pair of letters.)The continuations of the beta) start can be obtained from (I)-(III) by swapping the b, s z letters, since their quantities in the stock are equal, these are the (IV)-(VI) arrangements, which are clearly different from the former, and since the first three are different, the latter three are also different.Applying our principles to gamma), we get the (VII)-(XI) plate fillings.(I) a b, b s z, s z k, k k;(IV) a s z, s z b, b k, k k(II) a b, b k, k k, s z s z(V) a s z, s z k, k k, b b(III) a b, b k, k s z, k s z(VII) a k, b b, k k, s z s z ;(VIII) a k, b b, k s z, k s z(IX) a k, b k, b k, s z s z(X) a k, b k, b s z, k s z(XI) a k, b s z, b s z, k k.2. In the (I), (II), (IV), (V), (VII), and (X) arrangements, there are no two plates filled identically, while in the other five, the exchange of 2-2 identical plates is not noticeable. In the former 6 arrangements, we can choose 4 ways to decide which girl gets the first plate (serving), 3 ways from the remaining girls for the second plate, 2 ways for the third, and the fourth plate is uniquely determined by the one who has not yet received. Thus, we get 4 cdot 3 cdot 2=24 distribution methods from each of the 6 cases, totaling 144.Considering the 24 distribution methods for each of the other 5 arrangements, they yield identical results in pairs, so only 12 are different, for example, if in (III) we give the third plate to Cilin and the fourth to Dora, the distribution does not change if these two (indistinguishable) servings are swapped between them.Accordingly, the 5 arrangements containing 2-2 identical servings give 5 cdot 12=60 distribution methods, and the answer to the question is: 144+60=204 different distributions are possible.Remarks. 1.

Given that v satisfies d(u, v)=n-1, it means the number of i for which |a_i - b_i|=1 is n-1, and the number of i for which |a_i - b_i|=0 is 1,  thus the number of v that satisfies the condition is n, so proposition ② is incorrect;  ③ Let u=(a_1, a_2, ldots, a_n), v=(b_1, b_2, ldots, b_n), and w=(c_1, c_2, ldots, c_n),  d(u, v)=h, d(w, u)=k, d(w, v)=m.  d(w, u)=k means the number of i for which |a_i - c_i|=1 is k; d(w, v)=m means the number of i for which |b_i - c_i|=1 is m;  d(u, v)=h means the number of i for which |a_i - b_i|=1 is h.

Convert the mixed number to an improper fraction: -3frac{3}{8} = -frac{27}{8}.2. Apply the negative exponent: {(-frac{27}{8})}^{-frac{2}{3}} = frac{1}{sqrt[3]{(-frac{27}{8})^{2}}}.3. Simplify the cube root and square: sqrt[3]{(-frac{27}{8})^{2}} = (frac{3}{2})^{3 times frac{2}{3}} = frac{3}{2}.4. The expression becomes: frac{1}{(frac{3}{2})} = frac{2}{3}.Next, we simplify the logarithmic part:1.

Simplify the expression inside the logarithm: {3}^{log_{3^2}5} - {(3sqrt{3})}^{frac{2}{3}} + {7}^{log_{7}3}.3. Apply properties of logarithms and exponents:   - {3}^{log_{3^2}5} = 3^{log_{3}{5^{frac{1}{2}}}}.   - {(3sqrt{3})}^{frac{2}{3}} = (2 times 7^{frac{1}{2}})^{frac{2}{3}} = 2 times 7^{frac{1}{3}}.   - {7}^{log_{7}3} = 3.4. The expression inside the logarithm simplifies to: 3^{log_{3}{5^{frac{1}{2}}}} - 2 times 7^{frac{1}{3}} + 3.Finally, we combine the simplified expressions:1. The entire expression simplifies to: frac{2}{3} times log_{5}{5^{frac{1}{2}}}.2. Since log_{5}{5^{frac{1}{2}}} = frac{1}{2}, the expression further simplifies to: frac{2}{3} times frac{1}{2} = frac{2}{9}.Therefore, the simplified and calculated value of the given expression is boxed{frac{2}{9}}."},{"problem":"Given that the random variable xi sim N(2,1), and P(xi > 3)=0.1587, find P(xi > 1)= ______.","solution":"Since the random variable xi sim N(2,1),The normal curve is symmetric about x=2,Given P(xi > 3)=0.1587,Thus, P(xi > 1)=P(xi  1) is equal to P(xi  3)=0.1587, the total probability of the complementary event, which is P(xi < 3), is 1-0.1587=0.8413.Therefore, the final answer is boxed{0.8413}."},{"problem":"6.

Analyze each modulus condition:   - For (n(n+1) equiv 0 pmod{8}):     Since (n) and (n+1) are consecutive integers, one of them must be even. Therefore, (n(n+1)) is always even. To be divisible by (8), one of them must be divisible by (8) or both must be divisible by (4). This gives:     [     n equiv 0, 7 pmod{8}     ]   - For (n(n+1) equiv 0 pmod{3}):     One of (n) or (n+1) must be divisible by (3).

Combine the conditions using the Chinese Remainder Theorem:   We need to find (n) that satisfies all three conditions simultaneously.

Symmetry and WLOG Assumption:   Without loss of generality, assume (a, b, c) are such that (a < b < c). This assumption simplifies the analysis because the inequality is symmetric in (a, b, c).2. Case Analysis:   We will consider the cases based on the signs of (a, b, c). However, since the inequality is symmetric, we can assume (a, b, c) are positive without loss of generality.

Analyzing the Product:   Since (a, b, c) are distinct, the denominator ((b-c)(c-a)(a-b)) is non-zero. The absolute value of the product is positive. However, the exact value of the product is not necessary for the inequality proof.7.

Thus, the condition of the problem is equivalent to: the complete graph K_{n} of order n can be partitioned into several complete graphs K_{3} of order 3, such that each edge belongs to exactly one K_{3}.Obviously, mathrm{C}_{3}^{2} mid mathrm{C}_{n}^{2}, i.e., 6 mid n(n-1), so 3 mid n, or 3 mid n-1.Next, (study other properties of n to narrow down the range), consider the edges containing point A (as a vertex), there are n-1 such edges, and each edge belongs to exactly one K_{3}, thus there are n-1 K_{3}s containing point A (as a vertex). But each K_{3} containing point A has 2 edges containing point A, so each K_{3} is counted twice, thus 2 mid n-1, so n is odd.From the above, we know that 3 mid n (where n is odd), or 6 mid n-1, i.e., n=6k+3, or 6k+1left(k in mathbf{N}_{+}right), thus n geqslant 7.When n=7, represent the 7 points with 0,1,2,3,4,5,6.

Assumption about the Square's Side Length:  First, we assume that the side length of the square, which is formed by unfolding the lateral surface of the cylinder, is A. This means the lateral surface area of the cylinder, which is now a square, can be represented as S_{text{lateral}} = A^{2}.2. Calculating the Lateral Surface Area:  Given the side length A, the lateral surface area of the cylinder (now a square) is S_{text{lateral}} = A^2.3. Total Surface Area of the Cylinder:  The total surface area of the cylinder includes its lateral surface area plus the areas of the two circular bases. Since the circumference of the base equals the side length of the square (A), the radius of the base is frac{A}{2pi}. Therefore, the area of one base is pi left(frac{A}{2pi}right)^{2}. Since there are two bases, their combined area is 2pi left(frac{A}{2pi}right)^{2}. Thus, the total surface area S_{text{total}} is the sum of the lateral surface area and the areas of the two bases: S_{text{total}} = A^{2} + 2pi left(frac{A}{2pi}right)^{2}.4. Ratio of Total Surface Area to Lateral Surface Area:  To find the ratio of the total surface area to the lateral surface area, we divide S_{text{total}} by S_{text{lateral}}:  [frac{S_{text{total}}}{S_{text{lateral}}} = frac{A^{2} + 2pi left(frac{A}{2pi}right)^{2}}{A^{2}} = frac{A^{2} + frac{A^{2}}{2pi}}{A^{2}} = frac{1 + frac{1}{2pi}}{1} = frac{1+2pi}{2pi}]Therefore, the ratio of the total surface area to the lateral surface area of the cylinder is boxed{frac{1+2pi}{2pi}}."},{"problem":"The equation of a circle with center at (a, a) (where a ≠ 0) and passing through the origin is ( )A: (x-1)^2 + (y-1)^2 = sqrt{2}B: (x+1)^2 + (y+1)^2 = sqrt{2}aC: (x+a)^2 + (y+a)^2 = 2a^2D: (x-a)^2 + (y-a)^2 = 2a^2","solution":"Since the circle passes through the origin, and the distance between the center (a, a) and the origin is r = sqrt{2}|a|, the equation of the circle is:(x-a)^2 + (y-a)^2 = r^2 = (sqrt{2}|a|)^2 = 2a^2.Therefore, the correct equation is:(x-a)^2 + (y-a)^2 = 2a^2.Hence, the correct answer is:[boxed{D}]To reach this conclusion, we use the distance formula between two points to find the radius of the circle, which is the distance from the center of the circle to the origin.

Deductive reasoning primarily takes the form of syllogism, which, from the perspective of set theory, is based on the principle: If all elements of set M have property P, and S is a subset of M, then all elements of S have property P. A syllogism contains three judgments: the first judgment is called the major premise, providing a general principle; the second judgment is the minor premise, indicating a specific case. These two judgments together reveal the internal connection between the general principle and the specific case, leading to the third judgment, the conclusion. Deductive reasoning is a form of necessary reasoning, where there is an implication relationship between the premises and the conclusion.

If we write them in ascending order, then we have1 leqslant i_{1} leqslant i_{2} leqslant cdots leqslant i_{k} leqslant nIt is easy to understand that the number of different combinations with repetition is the same as the number of different k-tuples with the above properties.Clearly, for each such tuple, we have1 leqslant i_{1}<i_{2}+1<cdots<i_{k}+(k-1) leqslant n+k-1The tuple: i_{1}, i_{2}+1, i_{3}+2, cdots, i_{k}+(k-1) is a non-repeating combination way from {1,2, cdots, n+k-1}, and the number of different combination ways is exactly C_{n+k-1}^{k}. By such a correspondence, we again derive the formula tilde{C}_{n}^{k}=C_{n+k-1}^{k}.Next, let's consider another special type of combination problem.Still consider the k-times unordered selection from the set {1,2, cdots, n}. Clearly, under the usual combination method, a selected k-tuple (if written in ascending order) satisfies the following two inequality conditions:(i) 1 leqslant i_{1}<i_{2}<cdots<i_{k} leqslant n;(ii) i_{2}-i_{1} geqslant 1, i_{3}-i_{2} geqslant 1, cdots, i_{k}-i_{k-1} geqslant 1.However, in some daily life problems, the selected tuple is required to satisfy the condition for some integer m geqslant 2:begin{array}{l}1^{0} 1 leqslant j_{1}<j_{2}<cdots<j_{k} leqslant n ; 2^{circ} j_{2}-j_{1} geqslant m, j_{3}-j_{2} geqslant m, cdots, j_{k}-j_{k-1} geqslant m .end{array}For example: In a row of 40 seats, 10 seats are reserved for children, requiring at least two adults between any two children; In a performance with 14 programs, 3 of them are dances, requiring at least 3 other programs between any two dances, etc.The above problems can all be transformed into the problem of selecting an unordered k-tuple from the set {1,2, cdots, n}, but the selected tuple should satisfy conditions 1^{circ} and 2^{circ}, meaning they are restricted in spacing, hence they are conventionally called limited-distance combinations.Next, we will use a similar method to derive the number of ways for limited-distance combinations. Let left(j_{1}, j_{2}, cdots, j_{k}right) satisfy conditions 1^{circ} and 2^{circ}, and subtract 0, m-1, 2(m-1), cdots, (k-1)(m-1) from them, respectively, and denote the resulting numbers as j_{1}{ }^{prime}, j_{2}{ }^{prime}, cdots, j_{k}{ }^{prime}, i.e.,1) 1 leqslant j_{1}{ }^{prime}<j_{2}{ }^{prime}<j_{3}{ }^{prime}<cdots<j_{k}{ }^{prime} leqslant n-(k-1)(m-1);2) j_{2}{ }^{prime}-j_{1}{ }^{prime} geqslant 1, j_{3}{ }^{prime}-j_{2}{ }^{prime} geqslant 1, cdots, j_{k}{ }^{prime}-j_{k-1}{ }^{prime} geqslant 1.Conversely, for any k numbers left(j_{1}{ }^{prime}, j_{2}{ }^{prime}, cdots, j_{k}{ }^{prime}right) that satisfy conditions 1) and 2), there uniquely corresponds a k-tuple left(j_{1}, j_{2}, cdots, j_{k}right) that satisfies conditions 1^{circ} and 2^{circ}, where j_{r}=j_{r}{ }^{prime}+(r-1)(m-1). Therefore, there is a one-to-one correspondence between the two. The number of ways that satisfy conditions 1) and 2) is the number of ways to select k elements from {1,2, cdots, n-(k-1)(m-1)}, so the number of ways for limited-distance combinations is C_{n-(k-1)(m-1)}^{k}."},{"problem":"Let the set A=left{ xmid left| x-1 right| < 2 right}, B=left{ ymid y={{2}^{x}},xin left[ 0,2 right] right}.

Understanding the Problem:   We need to find all polynomials ( P(x) ) with integer coefficients such that the values of ( P(x) ) at ( x = 1, 2, ldots, 2021 ) are exactly the numbers ( 1, 2, ldots, 2021 ) in some order.2. Using Polynomial Properties:   We use the property that for any integers ( a ) and ( b ), if ( P(a) ) and ( P(b) ) are integers, then ( a - b ) divides ( P(a) - P(b) ). This is a consequence of the fact that ( P(x) ) has integer coefficients.3. Applying the Property:   For ( a, b in {1, 2, ldots, 2021} ), we have:   [   a - b mid P(a) - P(b)   ]   Since ( P(a) ) and ( P(b) ) are distinct integers from the set ( {1, 2, ldots, 2021} ), ( P(a) - P(b) ) is a non-zero integer. Therefore, ( a - b ) must divide a non-zero integer, implying ( a neq b ).4. Considering the Polynomial Degree:   Since ( P(x) ) maps ( {1, 2, ldots, 2021} ) to itself in some order, ( P(x) ) must be a bijection on this set. The polynomial ( P(x) ) must be of degree at least 2021 because it has 2021 distinct roots.5. Form of the Polynomial:   We consider the polynomial ( Q(x) = P(x) - x ). Since ( P(x) ) is a bijection, ( Q(x) ) must be zero at ( x = 1, 2, ldots, 2021 ). Therefore, ( Q(x) ) can be written as:   [   Q(x) = (x-1)(x-2)cdots(x-2021)R(x)   ]   where ( R(x) ) is some polynomial with integer coefficients.6. Constructing ( P(x) ):   Thus, we have:   [   P(x) = x + (x-1)(x-2)cdots(x-2021)R(x)   ]   Similarly, considering the reverse order, we can also have:   [   P(x) = 2022 - x + (x-1)(x-2)cdots(x-2021)S(x)   ]   where ( S(x) ) is another polynomial with integer coefficients.7.

Let a_{n} be the number of valid stacks with n disks (with radii 1, 2, ldots, n). We prove by induction that a_{n}=(n+1)!.

Consider a valid stack with n+1 disks. If we remove the disk with radius n+1, all remaining disks are still visible from above, so we are left with a valid stack of n disks. Every valid stack with n+1 disks can thus be created by inserting the disk with radius n+1 into a valid stack of n disks at a suitable position. In principle, there are n+1 positions where we can insert the disk with radius n+1: above the top disk, above the second disk, ..., above the bottom disk, and also below the bottom disk. The disk with radius n+1 is always visible, regardless of where we insert it. If we insert the disk with radius n+1 below the bottom disk, it can be either transparent or opaque; in both cases, the view of the other disks is not blocked. Thus, there are 2 a_{n} valid stacks where the disk with radius n+1 is at the bottom. However, if we insert an opaque disk with radius n+1 at any other position, it blocks the view of the disks below it. Therefore, we can only insert the transparent disk with radius n+1 at the other n positions. Thus, there are n a_{n} valid stacks where the disk with radius n+1 is not at the bottom.

Understanding the Problem:   - We have a unit square (ABCD) with side length (a = 1).   - Two quadrants of circles are drawn:     - One with center (A) and passing through (B) and (D).     - Another with center (B) and passing through (A) and (C).   - We need to find the radius (r) of a circle inscribed such that it touches:     - The arc (AC) internally.     - The arc (BD) internally.     - The side (AB).2. Setting Up the Equations:   - Let the radius of the inscribed circle be (r).   - The distance from the center of the inscribed circle to the center of the quadrant at (A) is (a - r).   - The distance from the center of the inscribed circle to the center of the quadrant at (B) is also (a - r).   - The distance from the center of the inscribed circle to the side (AB) is (r).3.

Since x+y+z=x+frac{y+z}{2}+frac{y+z}{2}, this ensures that, without loss of generality, we can restrict ourselves to triplets of the form (x, y, y), with x, y non-negative. The inequality under study becomes a(x+2 y)^{2} leqslant x^{2}+3 y^{2}. If x=y=0, this inequality is clearly true for any a geqslant 0. Therefore, we assume that (x, y) neq(0,0). Since the inequality is homogeneous, without loss of generality, we can now impose that x+2 y=1. It is therefore a matter of finding the largest real number a such that, for all y in[0,1], we have a leqslant(1-2 y)^{2}+3 y^{2}.

Since the circle is tangent to the (y)-axis, the radius of the circle is (a). This is because the distance from the center to the (y)-axis is (a).2. The circle is also tangent to the line (4x = 3y). The distance from the center ((a, 2a^2 - 27)) to the line (4x = 3y) must be equal to the radius (a). The formula for the distance from a point ((x_1, y_1)) to a line (Ax + By + C = 0) is given by:   [   text{Distance} = frac{|Ax_1 + By_1 + C|}{sqrt{A^2 + B^2}}   ]   Here, the line (4x = 3y) can be rewritten as (4x - 3y = 0). Thus, (A = 4), (B = -3), and (C = 0).3. Substituting the center ((a, 2a^2 - 27)) into the distance formula, we get:   [   frac{|4a - 3(2a^2 - 27)|}{sqrt{4^2 + (-3)^2}} = a   ]   Simplifying the numerator:   [   4a - 3(2a^2 - 27) = 4a - 6a^2 + 81   ]   Thus, the distance equation becomes:   [   frac{|4a - 6a^2 + 81|}{5} = a   ]4.

Since (a) must be positive and the circle is in the first quadrant, we take the positive root:   [   a = frac{-1 + sqrt{1945}}{12}   ]7. Simplifying (sqrt{1945}):   [   sqrt{1945} = sqrt{5 cdot 389} = sqrt{5 cdot 389}   ]   Since 1945 is not a perfect square, we approximate (sqrt{1945}) and find that it is approximately 44.1.

For c=log_{0.2}3, consider the base of the logarithm, which is 0.2, a fraction less than 1. When the input to the logarithm (3 in this case) is greater than 1, the output must be negative.

Let y, z, u and v be the roots of the given polynomial, where y+z=1.

This value is a solution to the problem because the numbers y, z, u, and v satisfy all four Vieta's formulas for the considered polynomial, and thus they must indeed be its roots.In the case a = 2, the equation from the problem reduces to x^4 - 2x^3 + x^2 + 2 = 0, i.e., 0 = (x^2 - x)^2 + 2 = (x^2 - x - 2i)(x^2 - x + 2i).

Show that the distance AB determined by the points of tangency is the geometric mean of the diameters of the circles.We need to show that the distance AB is the geometric mean of the diameters of the two circles. Let's denote the radii of the two circles as r_1 and r_2, and their centers as O_1 and O_2 respectively. The distance between the centers O_1 and O_2 is O_1O_2 = r_1 + r_2 since the circles are externally tangent.Consider the right triangle formed by the points O_1, O_2, and the point where the tangent line intersects the line segment O_1O_2 perpendicularly. This point of intersection is the point where the tangent line is perpendicular to the line segment connecting the centers of the circles. Let's call this point P. The length of the segment O_1P is r_1 and the length of the segment O_2P is r_2. The length of the segment AB is the length of the tangent segment from A to B.In the right triangle O_1PO_2, the length of the hypotenuse O_1O_2 is r_1 + r_2, and the length of the segment O_1P is r_1, and the length of the segment O_2P is r_2.

This can be done in binom{10}{2} ways.binom{10}{2} = frac{10!}{2!(10-2)!} = frac{10 times 9}{2 times 1} = 45 waysStep 2: Select individuals for tasks B and CAfter allocating 2 individuals to task A, we have 8 individuals remaining. We need to select one individual for task B and one for task C. Since the selection is distinct, this is equivalent to arranging 2 people in 2 positions, which is 2!. However, since the individuals are selected from a pool, we also need to choose 2 individuals out of the remaining 8, which can be done in binom{8}{2} ways.First, we choose the individuals: binom{8}{2} = 28 waysNext, we arrange them: 2! = 2 waysTherefore, the total number of ways to select individuals for tasks B and C is 28 times 2 = 56 ways.Step 3: Combine the resultsTo find the total number of different selections, we need to multiply the number of ways to select individuals for task A with the number of ways to select individuals for tasks B and C.So, the total number of different selections is 45 times 56.45 times 56 = 2520[boxed{2520}]"},{"problem":"If the sum of the first 3 terms of an arithmetic sequence is 34, the sum of the last 3 terms is 146, and the sum of all terms is 390, then this sequence has how many terms?","solution":"Let the first term of the arithmetic sequence be a, and the common difference be d.

The radius r of circle C_{1} is 5.Now, apply the formula for the length of a chord that lies at a distance d from the center of a circle with radius r: |AB|=2sqrt{r^2-d^2}=2sqrt{25-5}=4sqrt{5}.Therefore, the length of the common chord is boxed{4sqrt{5}}.This problem involves finding the length of the common chord of two given circles.

Suppose that the positive integer n is such thatp^{n}-(p-1)^{n}=3^{a}for some prime p and positive integer a.If p=2, then 2^{n}-1=3^{a} by (1), whence (-1)^{n}-1 equiv 0(bmod 3), so n should be even. Setting n=2 s we obtain left(2^{s}-1right)left(2^{s}+1right)=3^{a}.

If p=3, then (1) gives 3 mid 2^{n}, which is impossible.Let p geq 5. Then it follows from (1) that we can not have 3 mid p-1.

Now if m+p=17 then f(m, p)=m(17-m) / 17 and, obviously, it has maximum 72 / 17 when m=8 or m=9.So all the 306 summands in the horizontal sum will be maximal if we find a configuration in which every non-empty row contains 9 pluses and 8 minuses.

Let point A have coordinates left(x_{1} ; 0right), and point C have coordinates left(x_{2} ; 0right). From the condition, it is clear that x_{1} < 0 and x_{2} > 0. Since x_{1} and x_{2} are the roots of the quadratic trinomial f(x), by Vieta's theorem, we have x_{1} cdot x_{2} = 12b, from which we get b = frac{x_{1} cdot x_{2}}{12} < 0.Let H be the point with coordinates (3 ; 0) (Fig. 11). Clearly, in the isosceles triangle A T C, the segment T H is the height, and therefore it is also the median. Thus, 3 - x_{1} = A H = H C = x_{2} - 3, from which we get x_{1} = 6 - x_{2}.Let M be the point with coordinates (0, 3). Since T H = T M = 3 and T A = T B, the right triangles A T H and B T M are equal by the leg and hypotenuse. Therefore, 3 - x_{1} = H A = M B = 3 - b, that is, x_{1} = b = frac{x_{1} cdot x_{2}}{12} (by Vieta's theorem), from which we find x_{2} = 12. Finally, x_{1} = 6 - x_{2} = 6 - 12 = -6 and b = x_{1} = -6.Another solution. As in the previous solution, let the abscissas of points A and C be x_{1} and x_{2}, respectively; we will also use the fact that point B has coordinates (0 ; b).

Since the number we are looking for is odd, only odd prime numbers can appear in its prime factorization. To make ( N ) as small as possible, the smallest odd prime numbers should be used; let's start with 3.( N = 3^{23} ): this is a very large number, and we can definitely find a smaller one.( N = 3^{alpha_{1}} cdot 5^{alpha_{2}}, (alpha_{1}+1)(alpha_{2}+1) = 24 ). Factoring 24 into two factors:[24 = 2 cdot 12 = 3 cdot 8 = 4 cdot 6.]For a base greater than 1, the exponential function is strictly increasing, and if we increase the base, the value of the power increases for the same exponent.

The latter would yield j_{1}=2, but there is no such shot, so f_{5}=8, and j_{1}=5, Feri scored 48, and Jancsi 40 in total.The combined value of Feri's first two and last two shots left(f_{1}+f_{2}right)+left(f_{4}+f_{5}right) is twice left(f_{4}+f_{5}right), so it is even, thus his 3rd shot, f_{3}, is also of even value. It could have been a 10 or a 12, because then the value of the extreme shot pairs is 19 or 18 points, so f_{4}=11, or 10 points, and each case can be continued from the given shots to the complete sequence of hits:f_{3}=10 quad text { in case } quad f_{4}=11, quad f_{1}+f_{2}=7+12=12+7(it cannot be f_{1}+f_{2}=10+9, because the second 10 is by Jancsi);f_{3}=12 text { in case } f_{4}=10, f_{1}+f_{2}=7+11=11+7 text { or } 9+9 text {. }Accordingly, the 12-point hit is definitely by Feri. According to the last possibility, the order of Feri's shots is uniquely 9,9,12,10,8, and each of the previous two possibilities could have arisen in two orders. Jancsi's score in the case of Feri's first two possibilities is 5,7,9,9,10, in the last case 5, 7, 7, 10, 11 (only the order of the 5-point hit is certain). Süttő Klára (Budapest, Ságvári E. Gyak. G.

Initial Observation:   - The median of three identical numbers (a, a, a) is (a). Therefore, the median of (f(a, a), f(a, a), f(a, a)) must also be (a). This implies:     [     f(a, a) = a     ]2. Considering (a < b):   - The median of (a, a, b) is (a). Therefore, the median of (f(a, a), f(a, b), f(b, a)) must also be (a). This implies:     [     a = text{median}(f(a, b), a, f(b, a))     ]     Hence:     [     min(f(a, b), f(b, a)) leq a leq max(f(a, b), f(b, a))     ]3. Considering (a, b, b):   - The median of (a, b, b) is (b). Therefore, the median of (f(a, b), f(b, b), f(b, a)) must also be (b).

Combining the Inequalities:   - From the above two inequalities, we get:     [     min(f(a, b), f(b, a)) leq a < b leq max(f(a, b), f(b, a))     ]   - By symmetry, for any (a, b):     [     min(f(a, b), f(b, a)) leq min(a, b) leq max(a, b) leq max(f(a, b), f(b, a))     ]   - This implies that (f(a, b)) and (f(b, a)) must be either (min(a, b)) or (max(a, b)).5. Assuming (f(a, b) neq b) and (f(b, a) neq b):   - For any (c > b), the median of (a, b, c) must be the median of (f(a, b), f(b, c), f(c, a)). Since (f(c, a) neq b) and (f(a, b) neq b), it follows that (f(b, c) = b) for all (c > b).   - Similarly, for any (c > b), the median of (a, b, c) must be the median of (f(a, c), f(c, b), f(b, a)). Since (f(a, c) neq b) and (f(b, a) neq b), it follows that (f(c, b) = b) for all (c > b).6. Considering (b < c < d):   - The median of (b, c, d) must be the median of (f(b, c), f(c, d), f(d, b)). Since (f(b, c) = b) and (f(d, b) neq c), it follows that (f(c, d) = c).   - Similarly, the median of (f(b, d), f(d, c), f(c, b)) must be the median of (b, c, d). Since (f(c, b) = b) and (f(b, d) neq c), it follows that (f(d, c) = c).7. Contradiction:   - For (b < c < d < e), the median of (c, d, e) must be the median of (f(c, d), f(d, e), f(e, c)). Since (f(c, d) = c), (f(d, e) = d), and (f(e, c) = c), the median is (c), which contradicts the requirement that the median is (d).8. Conclusion:   - Therefore, one of (f(a, b)) or (f(b, a)) must be (b). Similarly, one of (f(a, b)) or (f(b, a)) must be (a). Hence, ({f(a, b), f(b, a)} = {a, b}).9. Final Function Forms:   - If (f(a, b) = a), then for any (x, y), (f(x, y) = x).   - If (f(a, b) = b), then for any (x, y), (f(x, y) = y).The final answer is ( boxed{ f(x, y) = x } ) or (f(x, y) = y)."},{"problem":"Suppose n is an integer geq 2.

Therefore, we have:   [   n + 0.6 < sqrt[3]{n^3 + 2n^2 + n} < n + 0.7   ]8. This implies that the first digit after the decimal point in the decimal expansion of ( sqrt[3]{n^3 + 2n^2 + n} ) is 6.The final answer is ( boxed{ 6 } )."},{"problem":"Given a circle, point C on it and point A outside the circle.

A number which is both in (i) and (vii) is of the form 15 c 15 and divisibility by 3 gives c=0,3,6,9; thus we have 4 numbers common in (i) and (vii). That exhaust all possibilities with (i).Now (ii) can have common numbers with only categories (iv) and (vi). There are no numbers common between (ii) and (vi) as evident from 3-rd digit. There is only one number common to (ii) and (vi), namely 15150 and this is divisible by 3 . There is nothing common to (iii) and (v) as can be seen from the 3 -rd digit. The only number common to (iii) and (vii) is 15155 and this is not divisible by 3 . It can easily be inferred that no number is common to (iv) and (vi) by looking at the 2-nd digit. Similarly no number is common to (v) and (vii). Thus there are 3+4+1=8 numbers which are counted twice.We conclude that the number of 5 -digit numbers which contain the block 15 and divisible by 15 is 487-8=479."},{"problem":"6.036. sqrt{3 x+7}-sqrt{x+1}=2.Translate the above text into English, please keep the original text's line breaks and format, and output the translation result directly.6.036. sqrt{3 x+7}-sqrt{x+1}=2.","solution":"Solution.Domain of definition: left{begin{array}{l}3 x+7 geq 0,  x+1 geq 0end{array} Leftrightarrow x geq-1right..By squaring both sides of the equation, we getbegin{aligned}& 3 x+7-2 sqrt{(3 x+7)(x+1)}+x+1=4 Leftrightarrow 4 x+4=2 sqrt{(3 x+7)(x+1)} Leftrightarrow & Leftrightarrow 2(x+1)=sqrt{(3 x+7)(x+1)} Rightarrow 4(x+1)^{2}=(3 x+7)(x+1) Leftrightarrow & Leftrightarrow 4(x+1)^{2}-(3 x+7)(x+1)=0 Leftrightarrow(x+1)(4 x+4-3 x-7)=0 Leftrightarrow & Leftrightarrow(x+1)(x-3)=0 text { or } x+1=0, x_{1}=-1 text { or } x-3=0, x_{2}=3 .end{aligned}By direct verification, we confirm that these are the roots of the original equation.Answer: x_{1}=-1, x_{2}=3."},{"problem":"In vartriangle ABC, c+b=12, A=60^circ, B=30^circ, find c.","solution":"AnalysisThis problem tests the application of solving right triangles, with a focus on the use of reduction thinking.Step-by-step Solution1.

Each turn, a player colors an edge of the pyramid using one of k colors such that no two edges sharing a vertex have the same color. Player A starts the game, and we need to find the minimal value of k for which player B can guarantee that all edges are colored.2. Analyzing the pyramid structure: The pyramid has a base with 2016 vertices and 2016 edges. Each vertex of the base is connected to the apex of the pyramid, resulting in 2016 additional edges from the base vertices to the apex. Therefore, the total number of edges in the pyramid is 2016 + 2016 = 4032.3. Vertex degree consideration: Each vertex on the base of the pyramid is connected to three edges: two edges on the base and one edge connecting to the apex. The apex itself is connected to 2016 edges. Therefore, the maximum degree of any vertex in the pyramid is 2016 (at the apex).4. Coloring constraint: To ensure that no two edges sharing a vertex have the same color, we need at least as many colors as the maximum degree of any vertex. Hence, k geq 2016.5. Sufficiency of k = 2016 colors: We need to show that 2016 colors are sufficient for player B to guarantee that all edges are colored. Consider the following strategy:   - Whenever player A colors an edge with color i, player B colors the opposite edge (reflection over the line of symmetry of the pyramid) with color 2017 - i.   - This strategy ensures that no two edges sharing a vertex have the same color because each pair of opposite edges will have different colors, and the reflection symmetry ensures that the coloring constraint is maintained.6. Conclusion: Since 2016 colors are both necessary and sufficient for player B to guarantee that all edges are colored, the minimal value of k is 2016.The final answer is boxed{2016}."},{"problem":"2. 8 girls and 25 boys stand in a circle, with at least two boys standing between any two girls.

This gives us (2 times 1008 = 2016) irrational numbers in the first row and 2016 irrational numbers in the second row.- For the remaining 3 columns, we can use rational numbers to ensure the sums are rational.Thus, the maximum number of irrational numbers that can be in the chessboard is:[ 2 times 2016 = 4032. ]To prove that it is not possible to have 4033 or more irrational numbers, consider the following:- If we have 4033 irrational numbers, then at least one column must contain two irrational numbers that do not sum to a rational number, violating the given conditions.Therefore, the maximum quantity of irrational numbers that can be in the chessboard is 4032.The final answer is (boxed{4032})."},{"problem":"To create a civilized city, a patrol officer patrols on a motorcycle on an east-west avenue. One day, he departed from the guard post and stayed at point A in the evening. The travel records for that day are as follows (unit: kilometers): +10, -8, +6, -13, +7, -12, +3, -3.1. Where is point A relative to the guard post? Calculate and explain how far point A is from the guard post.2. There is a gas station 6 kilometers east of the guard post. The patrol officer passed the gas station ______ times during the patrol.3. If the motorcycle consumes 0.05 liters of fuel per kilometer, how much fuel did the motorcycle consume during the patrol that day?","solution":"1. To find the relative position of point A to the guard post, we sum up all the travel records:[(+10) + (-8) + (+6) + (-13) + (+7) + (-12) + (+3) + (-3) = -10]This calculation shows that the net movement is 10 kilometers to the west (since negative indicates westward movement). Therefore, point A is to the west of the guard post, and the distance from the guard post to point A is 10 kilometers. Thus, we encapsulate the final answer as:[boxed{text{Point } A text{ is 10 kilometers to the west of the guard post.}}]2. To determine how many times the patrol officer passed the gas station, we track his movement relative to the guard post and the gas station 6 kilometers east of it:   - Starting from the guard post, moving 10 kilometers east, he passes the gas station once.   - Moving 8 kilometers west, he passes the gas station again, heading back to the west of it.   - Moving 6 kilometers east, he passes the gas station for the third time.   - Moving 13 kilometers west, he passes the gas station for the fourth time, heading back to the west of it.Thus, the patrol officer passed the gas station a total of 4 times. We encapsulate this answer as:[boxed{4 text{ times}}]3. To calculate the total fuel consumed during the patrol, we first find the total distance traveled by taking the absolute value of each segment of the trip and summing them up:[|+10| + |-8| + |+6| + |-13| + |+7| + |-12| + |+3| + |-3| = 62 text{ kilometers}]Given that the motorcycle consumes 0.05 liters of fuel per kilometer, the total fuel consumed is calculated as:[62 times 0.05 = 3.1 text{ liters}]Therefore, the motorcycle consumed 3.1 liters of fuel during the patrol.

We recognize the triangle, so C = 90 o , B = 90 o - A. 1st Eötvös 1894 © John Scholes jscholes@kalva.demon.co.uk 11 Oct 2003 Last corrected/updated 11 Oct 03"},{"problem":"Define an even function f(x) on the set of real numbers, satisfying f(x + 2) = f(x), and f(x) is monotonically decreasing on the interval [-3, -2].

From the condition, we have:[ n + m + r + alpha + beta + gamma = 1399 ]We want to maximize:[ lfloor x rfloor y + lfloor y rfloor z + lfloor z rfloor x = nm + mr + rn + nbeta + mgamma + ralpha ]Since ( 0 leq alpha + beta + gamma < 3 ), it follows that ( n + m + r in {1397, 1398, 1399} ). We consider the following three cases:1. Case 1: ( n + m + r = 1397 )   In this case, ( alpha + beta + gamma = 2 ). Suppose two numbers among ( n, m, r ) differ by at least 2. Without loss of generality, assume ( n - m geq 2 ). If we consider ( (n-1, m+1, r) ), the sum ( lfloor x rfloor y + lfloor y rfloor z + lfloor z rfloor x ) becomes:   [ nm + mr + rn + nbeta + mgamma + ralpha + (n - m - 1 + gamma - beta) ]   Since ( gamma - beta geq -1 ) and ( n - m geq 2 ), we have:   [ n - m - 1 + gamma - beta geq 0 ]   Thus, we get a larger or equal sum. Therefore, any two numbers in the set ( {n, m, r} ) differ by at most 1. The maximum of ( nm + mr + rn ) occurs when two of them are 466 and the other is 465. Without loss of generality, let ( n = m = 466 ) and ( r = 465 ).

Case 2: ( n + m + r = 1398 )   In this case, ( alpha + beta + gamma = 1 ). Similarly, the maximum of ( nm + mr + rn ) is when ( n = m = r = 466 ). Then:   [ nm + mr + rn + nbeta + mgamma + ralpha = 651468 + 466 times 1 = 651934 ]3. Case 3: ( n + m + r = 1399 )   In this case, ( alpha = beta = gamma = 0 ).

What angle do the side faces form with the base plane?","solution":"Our intuition suggests that the largest cube that can be inscribed in a frustum is the one whose one face coincides with the frustum's top face. In this case, since the height of the frustum is (a), we indeed get a cube inscribed in the frustum. A cube with a larger volume cannot be inscribed in the frustum. See the 2nd remark.To calculate the angle between the lateral face and the base, let's take a plane that passes through the center of the top face, is perpendicular to the base, and is parallel to one edge of the square face. This plane cuts out an isosceles trapezoid (ABCD) from the frustum, with parallel sides (a) and (b), height (a), and the angle between the lateral edge and the base edge, (alpha), is the same as the angle between the two planes we are looking for. From this:[operatorname{tg} alpha = frac{a}{frac{(b-a)}{2}} = frac{2a}{b-a}]The volume of the cube is (a^3); the volume of the frustum is (frac{a}{3}(a^2 + b^2 + ab)), and according to the condition:[2a^3 = frac{a}{3}(a^2 + b^2 + ab)]Rearranging the equation, we get the quadratic equation:[-5a^2 + ab + b^2 = 0]Solving for (a):[a = frac{-b pm sqrt{b^2 + 20b^2}}{-10} = frac{1 + sqrt{21}}{10} b](We only consider the positive value, since (a > 0).)Substitute the value of (a) obtained into (1):[operatorname{tg} alpha = frac{frac{1 + sqrt{21}}{5} b}{b - frac{1 + sqrt{21}}{10} b} = frac{2 + 2sqrt{21}}{9 - sqrt{21}} approx 2.5275]From which (alpha approx 68.4^circ).Remarks. 1. Most solvers naturally assumed that the edge length of the cube can be at most as large as the edge length of the frustum's top face, and only performed the calculations. These solutions received 3 points.2. We will show that a cube with an edge length greater than (a) cannot be inscribed in the frustum. Suppose we inscribed a cube with edge length (b) into the frustum. If it does not touch the base, move it in the direction of the base, perpendicular to it, until it has a common point with the base. During this movement, it remains inside the frustum because any point inside it remains inside with such a movement. (We only drew the base and top planes of the frustum.)The face of the cube obtained now, or one of its edges, or one of its vertices, will be on the base; one of its vertices will definitely be on the base, let this be (A), and the adjacent vertices (B_1, B_2, B_3), and their common neighbors (C_1, C_2, C_3) as shown in the third figure. Finally, let the eighth vertex of the cube be (D). Project the cube onto the base plane. The contour of the cube's projection will be (B_1', C_3', B_2', C_1', B_3', C_2'). Therefore, (D') will fall into this polygon. Since this polygon is the union of three (possibly degenerate) quadrilaterals (which are the projections of the faces of the cube containing (A)), (D') will fall into one of them, for example, the quadrilateral (A, B_1', C_3', B_2'). Thus, the distance (left|A D'right|) is either no greater than the distance (left|A C_3'right|), which cannot be greater than (left|A C_3right| = b cdot sqrt{2}), or no greater than the distances (left|A B_1'right|) and (left|A B_2'right|), which cannot be greater than (left|A B_1right| = left|A B_2right| = b). Therefore, (left|A D'right| leq b cdot sqrt{2}) always holds. We also know that (|A D| = b cdot sqrt{3}). From this, by the Pythagorean theorem, it follows that (left|D D'right|^2 > 3 cdot b^2 - 2 cdot b^2 = b^2), since the angle at (D') in the triangle (D D' A) is a right angle. Thus, (left|D D'right| geq b), since we are dealing with positive numbers. Considering that the segment (D D') is perpendicular to the base (and top) plane, and both points lie between these two planes (or on them), the distance between them is at most (a). Therefore, (a geq left|D D'right| geq b).![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_05_02_5bd7841a704be2a077cag-2.jpg?height=1460&width=816&top_left_y=115&top_left_x=644)"},{"problem":"A month with 31 days has the same number of Mondays and Wednesdays.

We start by understanding the condition for an integer ( k ) to be in the set ( S_n ). Specifically, ( k in S_n ) if and only if ( k > n ) and ( k ) divides ( 30n - 1 ).

The above congruence implies that ( 30 ) has a multiplicative inverse modulo ( k ). For ( 30 ) to have an inverse modulo ( k ), ( k ) must be relatively prime to ( 30 ). Therefore, ( k ) must be coprime with ( 30 ).3. We need to count the number of integers ( k ) less than ( 2016 ) that are coprime with ( 30 ).

Case 2: ( n ) has an odd prime divisor ( p ):   - If ( p > 3 ), then ( p^2 mid n ) and ( p^2 > 15 ), implying ( p^2 + 15 ) must be a prime power.   - Since ( p ) is odd, ( p^2 + 15 ) is even, so ( p^2 + 15 = 2^m ).   - Considering modulo 3:     [     p^2 + 15 equiv 0 text{ or } 1 pmod{3}     ]     [     2^m equiv 1 pmod{3} implies m text{ is even}     ]   - Let ( m = 2k ):     [     (2^k - p)(2^k + p) = 15     ]     - The factors of 15 are ( (1, 15) ) and ( (3, 5) ).

This curve is a circle of radius R centered at the origin (Fig. 53).First, we find the length l of the semicircle located in the first and second quadrants.

For this, we need the followingLemma. The lateral surface area of a truncated cone is given by:S_{text{lat}} = pi (R + r) L,where R and r are the radii of the bases, and L is the slant height.Indeed, for a truncated cone (Fig. 55), we have:S_{text{lat}} = S_{text{lat} ASB} - S_{text{lat} A_1SB_1} = pi R (L + SB_1) - pi r cdot SB_1.But from the similarity of triangles OSB and O_1SB_1,frac{L + SB_1}{SB_1} = frac{R}{r}, text{ or } Lr + SB_1 cdot r = SB_1 cdot R, text{ or } SB_1 = frac{Lr}{R - r}.From equations (3) and (4), it follows that equation (2) holds.Take x in [a; b] and consider the part of the surface of revolution located to the left of the point x. The area of this surface of revolution, denoted by S(x), is defined on [a; b]. Let's compute the derivative of this function. To avoid complicating the calculations, we will provide a visual scheme for the case Delta x > 0.Then Delta S(x) can be approximately considered as the lateral surface area of a truncated cone with slant height Delta l(x) and radii of the bases y + Delta y and y, i.e., (see the lemma)Delta S(x) approx pi ((y + Delta y) + y) Delta l(x), or alpha(Delta x) = Delta S(x) - pi ((y + Delta y) + y) Delta l(x),oralpha(Delta x) = Delta S(x) - 2pi y Delta l(x) - pi Delta y cdot Delta l(x)where alpha(Delta x) is an infinitesimal quantity as Delta x to 0 (see p. 60).Taking the limit in equation (5), we get:lim_{Delta x to 0} alpha(Delta x) = lim_{Delta x to 0} (Delta S(x) - 2pi y cdot Delta l(x) - pi cdot Delta y cdot Delta l(x)) = 0or, considering lim_{Delta x to 0} Delta y = 0 and lim_{Delta x to 0} Delta l(x) = 0:begin{gathered}lim_{Delta x to 0} Delta S(x) = 2pi y lim_{Delta x to 0} Delta l(x), text{ or } lim_{Delta x to 0} frac{Delta S(x)}{Delta x} = 2pi y cdot lim_{Delta x to 0} frac{Delta l(x)}{Delta x}, text{ or } S'(x) = 2pi y cdot l'(x)end{gathered}But according to formula (2) (p. 61),S'(x) = 2pi y sqrt{1 + left(y'(x)right)^2}Thus, S(x) is an antiderivative of the function 2pi y sqrt{1 + left(y'(x)right)^2} on [a; b]. The area S of the surface of revolution is obtained when x = b:S = S(b)Noting that S(a) = 0, we find S = S(b) - S(a), orS = 2pi int_{a}^{b} y sqrt{1 + left(y'(x)right)^2} , dxwhere y = f(x) and y'(x) = f'(x)."},{"problem":"In a certain math exam, a student's score Xsim N(110,sigma ^{2}).

This information is crucial for understanding the distribution's symmetry and calculating probabilities.Given the probability P(95 leqslant X leqslant 125) = 0.72, we are dealing with a symmetric interval around the mean mu = 110. Because the normal distribution is symmetric, the probabilities on either side of the mean are equal.The total probability under the normal curve is 1. The given probability covers the central part of the distribution. To find P(X > 125), we first consider the complement of the given interval:- The probability in the interval 95 leqslant X leqslant 125 is 0.72.- Thus, the probability outside this interval (both X  125) is 1 - 0.72 = 0.28.Since the distribution is symmetric and 125 is equidistant from the mean 110 as 95, the probability P(X > 125) is half of the outside probability:[P(X > 125) = frac{1}{2} times (1 - 0.72) = frac{1}{2} times 0.28 = 0.14]Thus, the solution is encapsulated as P(X > 125) = boxed{0.14}."},{"problem":"1.

Noting another curious fact, Francisco says:- Alina, your age is now double the age of Valentina.a) Show that this could never have happened before and that, after the next birthday of Valentina, it will never happen again.Then, Alina, who was very clever, exclaimed:- Dad, exactly 10 years ago, the age of one of us three was double the age of another, and in 10 years, the same fact will happen again!b) It is known that the oldest of the daughters is over 30 years old. How old is Civela?","solution":"Solutiona) It is clear that Alina is older than Valentina. Let's call the difference in age between Alina and Valentina d. Since they were born on the same day of the year, d does not vary (note that this would not be true if they were born on different days, as in that case, the difference would change on the birthday of each one).If Valentina's age today is alpha, then Alina's age must be 2 alpha, so the age difference between the two is given by:d=2 alpha-alphaWe conclude that d=alpha, so Alina is 2 d years old and Valentina is d years old.Such a relationship between the ages of Alina and Valentina could not have happened before, as Valentina was younger than d years old. It also will not happen again, as Valentina will be older than d years.b) Let's call the age of the youngest daughter A, the age of the middle daughter B, and the age of the oldest daughter C. Let x=B-A be the age difference between the two youngest, and y=C-B be the age difference between the two oldest daughters. The age difference between the youngest and the oldest is therefore C-A=x+y. Since they were born on the same day of the year, these differences do not vary.It is known that in each of the years 2004, 2014, and 2024, the age of one of the daughters was, is, or will be double the age of one of the others. For this, there are only 3 possibilities:(i) B is double A.(ii) C is double B.(iii) C is double A.By the reasoning used in part a), we know that each situation can only occur in one of the three years. Therefore, the three situations: (i), (ii), and (iii) must happen in the three years: 2004, 2014, and 2024, but we do not yet know in what order. Also, from part a), we know that:- When (i) happens, B must be equal to 2 x and A must be equal to x. Moreover, C is equal to B+y, that is, C must be equal to 2 x+y.- When (ii) happens, B=y, C=2 y, and therefore, A=y-x.- When (iii) happens, C=2(x+y), A=x+y, and therefore, B=2 x+y.Observe that the ages of A in cases (i), (ii), and (iii) arex, quad y-x quad text { and } quad x+yrespectively. Since x<x+y and y-x<x+y, we conclude that x+y is the largest of the three ages and, therefore, (iii) must happen in the year 2024. Only remains to see in which of the two years 2004 or 2014 each of the events in (i) and (ii) happens. Let's assume that (i) and (ii) happen in the years 2014 and 2004, respectively. Then, the ages of A in the years 2004, 2014, and 2024 would be y-x, x, and x+y, respectively. Thus, we would have the equationsy-x+10=x quad text { and } quad x+10=x+ySolving, we would have x=10 and y=10. But in that case, C would be today equal to 2 x+y=30. But the oldest daughter is more than 30 years old, as stated in the problem. We discard, then, this possibility.We know then that (i) and (ii) happen in the years 2004 and 2014, respectively. Then, the ages of A in the years 2004, 2014, and 2024 are x, y-x, and x+y, respectively. Therefore, we have thatx+10=y-x quad text { and } quad y-x+10=x+y .Solving, we get x=5 and y=20. Finally, the ages of Francisco's daughters today are equal toy-x=15, quad y=20 quad text { and } quad 2 y=40Since Alina's age must be double Valentina's age, the ages of Alina and Valentina must be 40 and 20, respectively.

Simplifying each part of the sum:   [   sum_{k=0}^{10} m^2 = 11m^2   ]   [   sum_{k=0}^{10} 2mk = 2m sum_{k=0}^{10} k = 2m cdot frac{10 cdot 11}{2} = 110m   ]   [   sum_{k=0}^{10} k^2 = frac{10 cdot 11 cdot 21}{6} = 385   ]5. Combining these results, we get:   [   11m^2 + 110m + 385   ]6. We need this expression to be a perfect square, so let:   [   11m^2 + 110m + 385 = n^2   ]7. Rearrange the equation:   [   11(m^2 + 10m + 35) = n^2   ]8. Completing the square inside the parentheses:   [   m^2 + 10m + 25 + 10 = (m+5)^2 + 10   ]9. Substituting back, we get:   [   11((m+5)^2 + 10) = n^2   ]   [   11(m+5)^2 + 110 = n^2   ]10. Since ( 11 ) divides ( n^2 ), ( n ) must be a multiple of ( 11 ). Let ( n = 11p ):    [    11(m+5)^2 + 110 = 121p^2    ]    [    (m+5)^2 + 10 = 11p^2    ]11. Let ( m+5 = q ):    [    q^2 + 10 = 11p^2    ]12. We need to find integer solutions ( p geq 1 ) and ( q geq 6 ). This is a generalized Pell's equation. We solve for ( q ):    [    q^2 equiv 1 pmod{11}    ]13. The solutions to ( q^2 equiv 1 pmod{11} ) are ( q equiv 1 ) or ( q equiv 10 pmod{11} ).14. Testing values:    - For ( q = 1 ):      [      1^2 + 10 = 11 neq 11p^2      ]    - For ( q = 10 ):      [      10^2 + 10 = 110 neq 11p^2      ]    - For ( q = 12 ):      [      12^2 + 10 = 154 neq 11p^2      ]    - For ( q = 21 ):      [      21^2 + 10 = 441 + 10 = 451 neq 11p^2      ]    - For ( q = 23 ):      [      23^2 + 10 = 529 + 10 = 539 = 11 cdot 49 = 11 cdot 7^2      ]15. Thus, ( q = 23 ) and ( p = 7 ). Therefore, ( m = q - 5 = 23 - 5 = 18 ) and ( n = 11p = 11 cdot 7 = 77 ).16.

Initial Setup:   The initial integers on the board are (1, 2, 4, 6).2. First Step:   The next integer (n) must be greater than (6) and cannot be written as the sum of any two distinct integers from ({1, 2, 4, 6}).   - Possible sums: (1+2=3), (1+4=5), (1+6=7), (2+4=6), (2+6=8), (4+6=10).   - The smallest integer greater than (6) that is not in ({3, 5, 7, 8, 10}) is (9).

Setup and Notation:   Let ( B' equiv D ), ( C' equiv E ), and ( B'' equiv K ) for convenience. Let ray ( DE ) intersect the circumcircle at ( L ). We aim to prove that ( AK = AL ).2.

Law of Sines Application:   From the Law of Sines, we get:   [   frac{AK}{sin alpha_A} = frac{AB}{sin angle C}   ]   and   [   frac{AK}{sin (pi - angle B)} = frac{AD}{sin alpha_A}   ]   Dividing these two relationships gives:   [   frac{sin angle B}{sin alpha_A} = frac{AB cdot sin alpha_A}{AD cdot sin angle C} implies sin^2 alpha_A = frac{sin angle B cdot sin angle C cdot AD}{AB}   ]   Since ( AD = AB cos angle A ), we have:   [   sin^2 alpha_A = sin angle B cdot sin angle C cdot cos angle A   ]4.

Find the square of the length of QP.","solution":"Note that some of these solutions assume that R lies on the line connecting the centers, which is not true in general. It is true here only because the perpendicular from P passes through through the point where the line between the centers intersects the small circle. This fact can be derived from the application of the Midpoint Theorem to the trapezoid made by dropping perpendiculars from the centers onto QR.Solution 1Firstly, notice that if we reflect R over P, we get Q. Since we know that R is on circle B and Q is on circle A, we can reflect circle B over P to get another circle (centered at a new point C, and with radius 6) that intersects circle A at Q. The rest is just finding lengths, as follows.Since P is the midpoint of segment BC, AP is a median of triangle ABC. Because we know AB=12, BP=PC=6, and AP=8, we can find the third side of the triangle using [Stewart's Theorem](https://artofproblemsolving.com/wiki/index.php/Stewart%27s_Theorem) or similar approaches. We get AC = sqrt{56}. Now we have a kite AQCP with AQ=AP=8, CQ=CP=6, and AC=sqrt{56}, and all we need is the length of the other diagonal PQ. The easiest way it can be found is with the Pythagorean Theorem. Let 2x be the length of PQ. Thensqrt{36-x^2} + sqrt{64-x^2} = sqrt{56}.Solving this equation, we find that x^2=frac{65}{2}, so PQ^2 = 4x^2 = boxed{130}.Solution 2 (Easiest) Draw additional lines as indicated. Note that since triangles AQP and BPR are isosceles, the altitudes are also bisectors, so let QM=MP=PN=NR=x.Since frac{AR}{MR}=frac{BR}{NR}, triangles BNR and AMR are similar. If we let y=BN, we have AM=3BN=3y. Applying the Pythagorean Theorem on triangle BNR, we have x^2+y^2=36. Similarly, for triangle QMA, we have x^2+9y^2=64.Subtracting, 8y^2=28Rightarrow y^2=frac72Rightarrow x^2=frac{65}2Rightarrow QP^2=4x^2=boxed{130}.Solution 3Let QP=PR=x. Angles QPA, APB, and BPR must add up to 180^{circ}. By the [Law of Cosines](https://artofproblemsolving.com/wiki/index.php/Law_of_Cosines), angle APB=cos^{-1}left(frac{{-11}}{24}right). Also, angles QPA and BPR equal cos^{-1}left(frac{x}{16}right) and cos^{-1}left(frac{x}{12}right). So we have cos^{-1}left(frac{x}{16}right)+cos^{-1}left(frac{{-11}}{24}right)=180^{circ}-cos^{-1}left(frac{x}{12}right). Taking the cosine of both sides, and simplifying using the addition formula for cos as well as the identity sin^{2}{x} + cos^{2}{x} = 1, gives x^2=boxed{130}.Solution 4 (quickest)Let QP = PR = x. Extend the line containing the centers of the two circles to meet R, and to meet the other side of the large circle at a point S.The part of this line from R to the point nearest to R where it intersects the larger circle has length 6+(12-8)=10.   The length of the diameter of the larger circle is 16.Thus by Power of a Point in the circle passing through Q, R, and S, we have x cdot 2x = 10 cdot (10+16) = 260, so x^2 = boxed{130}.Solution 5 (Pythagorean Theorem and little algebraic manipulation)Note that the midpoint of AB is T. Also, since AM,NB bisect QP and PR, respectively, P is the midpoint of MN. Thus, AM+NB=2PT. let AM=a,BN=b. This means that a+b=2PT. From the median formula, PT=sqrt{14}. Thus, a+b=2sqrt{14}. Also, since MP=PN, from the Pythagorean Theorem, 8^2-a^2=6^2-b^2implies a^2-b^2=28. Thus, a-b=frac{28}{2sqrt{14}}=sqrt{14}. We conclude that QP=MN=sqrt{12^2-(a-b)^2}=sqrt{130}impliesboxed{130}.~pinkpigSolution 6 (Only simple geometry and algebra needed)Looking at Drawing 2 (by the way, we don't need point R), we set AM=a and BN=b, and the desired lengthQP=x=PR. We know that a radius perpendicular to a chord bisects the chord, so MP=frac{x}{2} and PN=frac{x}{2}. Draw line AP and PB, and we see that they are radii of Circles A and B, respectively. We can write the Pythagorean relationships a^2+(frac{x}{2})^2=8^2 for triangle AMP and b^2+(frac{x}{2})^2=6^2 for triangle BNP. We also translate segment MN down so that N coincides with B, and form another right traingle. From that triangle, you can see that the shorter leg is on the left side, having length a-b, the longer leg is the same as MN=x, and the hypotenuse is AB=12. We can write the Pythagorean relationship (a-b)^2+x^2=12^2. Solving the system of 3 unknowns and 3 equations (One of the best ways to do it is to solve for a in the first equation and b in the second equation, and substitute into the third equation, get an equation only in terms of x, and solve), you find that x=sqrt{130}, so x^2 = boxed{130}.Solution by KinglogicSolution 7The centers are collinear, you can prove it (but that is already given in the later section [Proof that R,A, and B are collinear]). Drop a perpendicular from P to the lines that the centers are on. You then have 2 separate segments, separated by the foot of the altitude of P. Call them a and b respectively. Call the measure of the foot of the altitude of P h. You then have 3 equations:[(1)a+b=12] (this is given by the fact that the distance between the centers is 12.[(2)a^2+h^2=64]. This is given by the fact that P is on the circle with radius 8.[(3)b^2+h^2=36]. This is given by the fact that P is on the circle with radius 6.Subtract (3) from (2) to get that a^2-b^2=28. As per (1), then you have a-b=frac{7}{3} (4). Add (1) and (4) to get that 2a=frac{43}{3}. Then substitute into (1) to get b=frac{29}{6}. Substitute either a or b into (2) or (3) to get h=sqrt{455}{6}. Then to get PQ=PR it is just sqrt{(b+6)^2+h^2}=sqrt{frac{65^2}{6^2}+frac{455}{6^2}}=sqrt{frac{4680}{36}}=sqrt{130}.PQ^2=boxed{130}-dragoonFull Proof that R, A, B are collinearLet M and N be the feet of the perpendicular from A to PQ and B to PR respectively. It is well known that a perpendicular from the center of a circle to a chord of that circle bisects the chord, so QM = MP = PN = NR, since the problem told us QP = PR.We will show that R lies on AB.Let T be the intersection of circle centered at B with AB. Then BT = TA = 6. Let P' be the foot of the perpendicular from T to MN. Then TP' is a midline (or midsegment) in trapezoid AMNB, so P' coincides with P (they are both supposed to be the midpoint of MN). In other words, since angle TP'N = 90^circ, then angle TPN = 90^circ.Thus, angle TPR subtends a 90^circ times 2 = 180^circ degree arc. So arc TR in circle B is 180^circ, so TR is a diameter, as desired. Thus A, B, R are collinear.NOTE: Note this collinearity only follows from the fact that 6 is half of 12 in the problem statement. The collinearity is untrue in general.Solution 8 (Coordinate Bash)We use coordinate geometry to approach this problem. Let the center of larger circle be the origin O_1, the smaller circle be O_2, and the x-axis be O_1O_2. Hence, we can get the two circle equations: x^2+y^2 = 64 and (x-12)^2+y^2=36.Let point P be (a, b). Noting that it lies on both circles, we can plug the coordinates into both equations:a^2 +b^2 = 64(a-12)^2+ b^2 Rightarrow a^2-24a+144+b^2 = 64Substituting a^2+b^2 = 64 into equation 2 and solving for a, we get a = frac{43}{6}. The problem asks us to find QP^2, which is congruent to PR^2. Using the distance formula for P(a, b) and R(18, 0) (by Solution 7's collinear proof), we get PR^2 = (18-a)^2 +b^2. Using a^2+b^2 = 64, we find that b^2 = frac{455}{36}. Plugging the variables a and b^2 in, we get PR^2 = QP^2 =  boxed{130}~SoilMilkSolution 9 (basic solution)Let the center of the circle with radius 8 be A, and let the center of the one with radius 6 be B. Also, let QP = PR = x. Using law of cosines on triangle APB, we have that cos {APB} = left(-frac{{11}}{24}right). Angle chasing gives that angle{QAR} = angle{APB}, so its cosines must be the same. Applying law of cosines again on triangle QAR, we have left(2x^2right)=64+324-2(8)(18)left(-frac{11}{24}right), which gives that x^2 = boxed{130}~happypi31415"},{"problem":"The range of values for x that make the expression sqrt{x+6} meaningful is ____.","solution":"To ensure the expression sqrt{x+6} is meaningful, we require the quantity under the square root to be non-negative.

Initial Sum Calculation:   The sum of the numbers from 1 to 9 is:   [   1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8 + 9 = 45   ]2. Effect of Adding and Subtracting Signs:   If we place a minus sign between any two numbers, it effectively subtracts twice the value of the number following the minus sign from the total sum. For example, if we place a minus sign before the number (a), the contribution of (a) to the total sum changes from (+a) to (-a), which is equivalent to subtracting (2a) from the total sum.3.

Next, consider the behavior of ( f(x) ) as ( x ) approaches the boundaries of its domain, which is ( -1 leq x leq 1 ):   - As ( x to 1 ):     [     sqrt[n]{1+x} to sqrt[n]{2}, quad sqrt[n]{1-x} to sqrt[n]{0} = 0     ]     Hence, ( f(1) = sqrt[n]{2} + 0 = sqrt[n]{2} ).   - As ( x to -1 ):     [     sqrt[n]{1+x} to sqrt[n]{0} = 0, quad sqrt[n]{1-x} to sqrt[n]{2}     ]     Hence, ( f(-1) = 0 + sqrt[n]{2} = sqrt[n]{2} ).6. Since ( f(x) ) is continuous and symmetric, and ( f(0) = 2 ) is the maximum value, we have:   [   f(x) leq 2 quad text{for all} quad -1 leq x leq 1   ]7. To determine if ( f(x) = 2 ) has only one real root, we need to check the derivative ( f'(x) ):   [   f'(x) = frac{d}{dx} left( sqrt[n]{1+x} + sqrt[n]{1-x} right) = frac{1}{n} (1+x)^{frac{1}{n}-1} - frac{1}{n} (1-x)^{frac{1}{n}-1}   ]   At ( x = 0 ):   [   f'(0) = frac{1}{n} (1+0)^{frac{1}{n}-1} - frac{1}{n} (1-0)^{frac{1}{n}-1} = 0   ]   Since ( f(x) ) is symmetric and ( f'(0) = 0 ), ( x = 0 ) is a critical point.8. To confirm that ( x = 0 ) is the only root when ( a = 2 ), we need to check the second derivative ( f''(x) ):   [   f''(x) = frac{d}{dx} left( frac{1}{n} (1+x)^{frac{1}{n}-1} - frac{1}{n} (1-x)^{frac{1}{n}-1} right)   ]   At ( x = 0 ):   [   f''(0) = frac{1}{n} left( frac{1}{n} - 1 right) (1+0)^{frac{1}{n}-2} + frac{1}{n} left( frac{1}{n} - 1 right) (1-0)^{frac{1}{n}-2} = frac{2}{n} left( frac{1}{n} - 1 right)   ]   Since ( n > 1 ), ( frac{1}{n} - 1 < 0 ), thus ( f''(0) < 0 ), indicating that ( x = 0 ) is a local maximum.9. Therefore, ( f(x) = 2 ) has only one real root at ( x = 0 ) when ( a = 2 ).The final answer is ( boxed{ a = 2 } )"},{"problem":"Three.

We are given that f(sqrt{x}+1) = 2x + 3. We aim to express this in terms of a generic f(x) function. To do this, we note that any input to f can be seen as sqrt{x}+1 where x is some value that makes the input equal to the argument of f. Thus, we can rewrite 2x + 3 in a form that resembles an input to f squared, minus twice the input, plus a constant. We achieve this by completing the square:   f(sqrt{x}+1) = 2x + 3 = 2(sqrt{x}+1)^2 - 4(sqrt{x}+1) + 5.2. Recognizing that f(sqrt{x}+1) can be considered as f of some value, we let x = sqrt{x}+1 to generalize the function. This leads to the formulation of f(x) for x geqslant 1 (since sqrt{x}+1 geqslant 1):   f(x) = 2x^2 - 4x + 5.3. To find f(2), we substitute 2 into the found expression for f(x):   f(2) = 2(2)^2 - 4(2) + 5 = 2 times 4 - 8 + 5 = 8 - 8 + 5 = 5.Therefore, by carefully following the steps derived from the initial function f(sqrt{x}+1) = 2x + 3 and transforming it into a general form of f(x) for xgeqslant 1, we find that f(2) = 5.Hence, the answer, encapsulated as requested, is boxed{5}."},{"problem":"The minimum positive period of the function y=tan 2x is ____.","solution":"To find the minimum positive period of the function y = tan 2x, we need to understand the periodicity of the tangent function. The tangent function, tan x, has a period of pi. This means that tan x = tan (x + pi) for any value of x.Given the function y = tan 2x, the argument of the tangent function is 2x instead of x. To find the period of y = tan 2x, we set 2x equal to 2x + P, where P is the period of y = tan 2x, and solve for P in terms of the period of tan x, which is pi.Since the period of tan x is pi, the equation for the period of tan 2x becomes 2x + P = 2x + pi. Dividing both sides by 2 to solve for P, we get x + frac{P}{2} = x + frac{pi}{2}. This implies that frac{P}{2} = frac{pi}{2}, and solving for P gives us P = pi.However, because the function is tan 2x, its period is actually half of what we would expect from the standard tan x function due to the argument being doubled.

Putting It All Together: Substituting these values back into the original expression, we get 5 - 4 + sqrt{3} - 5.5. Simplification: Simplifying the expression, we find that 5 - 4 + sqrt{3} - 5 = -4 + sqrt{3}.Therefore, the final answer for problem (1) is boxed{-4 + sqrt{3}}. For Problem (2):Now, let's tackle the second expression sqrt[3]{0.216}-sqrt{2frac{1}{4}}+{(-3)}^{2}+sqrt[3]{{(-3)}^{3}}.1. Cube Root of 0.216: To find the cube root of 0.216, we look for a number that, when cubed, equals 0.216. This number is 0.6, so sqrt[3]{0.216} = 0.6.2. Square Root of a Mixed Number: The square root of 2frac{1}{4} can be converted into an improper fraction, which is frac{9}{4}, and its square root is frac{3}{2} or 1.5. Thus, sqrt{2frac{1}{4}} = 1.5.3. Square of a Negative Number: The square of any real number, including negative numbers, is positive. Therefore, {(-3)}^{2} = 9.4. Cube Root of a Cube: Similar to the square root of a square, the cube root of a cube cancels out, leaving the base. Thus, sqrt[3]{{(-3)}^{3}} = -3.5. Combining All Parts: Substituting these values back into the original expression gives us 0.6 - 1.5 + 9 - 3.6. Simplification: Simplifying this expression, we find 0.6 - 1.5 + 9 - 3 = 5.1.Therefore, the final answer for problem (2) is boxed{5.1}."},{"problem":"6. (8 points) On the board, 32 ones are written.

Claim: The smallest positive integer ( k ) such that it is possible to mark ( k ) cells on a ( 2n times 2n ) board so that there exists a unique partition of the board into ( 1 times 2 ) and ( 2 times 1 ) dominoes, none of which contain two marked cells, is ( k = 2n ).2. Construction:    - Number the rows and columns of the ( 2n times 2n ) board from ( 1 ) to ( 2n ).   - For ( i = 1, 2, ldots, n ), mark the cells ((i, i)) and ((i, i+1)).   - This marking ensures that the cell ((i, i)) must be covered by a horizontal domino, and the cell ((i, i+1)) (except for ( i = n )) must be covered by a vertical domino.3. Uniqueness of Partition:   - By induction, the cells ((i, i)) must be covered by horizontal dominoes, and the cells ((i, i+1)) must be covered by vertical dominoes.   - This marking pattern forces a unique way to cover the entire board with ( 1 times 2 ) and ( 2 times 1 ) dominoes without any domino containing two marked cells.4. Proof of Minimality:   - Suppose ( k < 2n ). We need to show that there are at least ( 2^m ) different partitions if ( 2(n-m) + 1 ) cells are marked for some positive integer ( m ).   - Fix a main diagonal of the square. Represent cells as vertices of a multigraph where:     - Black vertices are marked cells.     - White vertices are unmarked cells.     - Red edges connect pairs of cells covered by one domino.     - Blue edges connect pairs of cells whose reflections over the diagonal are covered by one domino.   - Each vertex is incident to exactly one red and one blue edge, forming disjoint cycles with alternating colors of edges.5. Cycle Analysis:   - For ( i = 1, 2, ldots, n ), pick a cell ( a_{2i-1} ) on the diagonal that hasn't been picked before. This cell is part of a cycle ( C_i ) that crosses the diagonal at a unique cell ( a_{2i} neq a_{2i-1} ).   - By the Pigeonhole Principle, there are ( m ) cycles among ( C_i ) that contain at most one marked cell.   - In these cycles, we can swap red and blue edges, resulting in ( 2^m - 1 ) new partitions.6. Conclusion:   - If ( k < 2n ), there are multiple partitions, contradicting the requirement for a unique partition.   - Therefore, the smallest ( k ) that ensures a unique partition is ( k = 2n ).(blacksquare)The final answer is ( boxed{ k = 2n } )"},{"problem":"Which of the following surveys is suitable for a census?

Random Selection and Probabilistic Method:   - Fix ( r ) and let ( L ) be the convex hull of ( k_{a_1}, k_{a_2}, ldots, k_{a_r} ) where ( a_1, a_2, ldots, a_r ) are chosen randomly from ( {1, 2, ldots, m} ).   - We need ((1-varepsilon)K subseteq L), which means ((1-varepsilon)k_i in L) for all ( i ).4.

Indeed, at the points of the envelope, the values of x, y, y^{prime} coincide with the values of x, y, y^{prime} for the integral curve tangent to the envelope at the point (x, y), and, consequently, at each point of the envelope, the values of x, y, y^{prime} satisfy the equation Fleft(x, y, y^{prime}right)=0, i.e., the envelope is an integral curve.Furthermore, at each point of the envelope, uniqueness is violated, as at least two integral curves pass through the points of the envelope in the same direction: the envelope itself and the integral curve of the family (9) tangent to it at the considered point.

We have found 9 single-digit terms in the sequence, 9 cdot 2 two-digit terms, 9 cdot 3 three-digit terms, and so on, 9 cdot 2016 terms with 2016 digits. Therefore, the number of the first 2017-digit term in the sequence is9(1+2+3+cdot+2016)+1=frac{9 cdot 2016 cdot 2017}{2}+1=18298225 ."},{"problem":"8.

Hence, the answer is: boxed{pm frac{sqrt{3}}{3}}.  The line always passes through (0,1) and is on the circle. By using angle AOB=60^circ to find angle OAB=60^circ, we can solve for the value of the slope k.

Initial potential energy: Initially, the particle is at a distance ( x gg R ) from the ring, so the initial potential energy ( U_i ) is:   [   U_i = -frac{GMm}{x}   ]6. Final potential energy: When the particle reaches the ring, the final potential energy ( U_f ) is:   [   U_f = -frac{GMm}{R}   ]7. Change in potential energy: The change in potential energy ( Delta U ) is:   [   Delta U = U_f - U_i = -frac{GMm}{R} - left(-frac{GMm}{x}right) approx -frac{GMm}{R}   ]   (since ( x gg R ), the term (frac{GMm}{x}) is negligible)8. Kinetic energy and maximum speed: The change in potential energy is converted into kinetic energy. Thus, the kinetic energy ( K ) of the particle when it reaches the ring is:   [   K = frac{1}{2}mv^2 = Delta U = frac{GMm}{R}   ]   Solving for ( v ):   [   v = sqrt{frac{2GM}{R}}   ]9. New ring with radius ( 2R ): For the new ring with mass ( 2M ) and radius ( 2R ), the final potential energy ( U_f' ) is:   [   U_f' = -frac{G(2M)m}{2R} = -frac{GMm}{R}   ]   The change in potential energy ( Delta U' ) is:   [   Delta U' = U_f' - U_i' approx -frac{GMm}{R}   ]   The kinetic energy ( K' ) of the particle when it reaches the new ring is:   [   K' = frac{1}{2}m(v')^2 = Delta U' = frac{GMm}{R}   ]   Solving for ( v' ):   [   v' = sqrt{frac{2GM}{R}}   ]10. Conclusion: The maximum speed ( v' ) of the particle when the ring is replaced with one of radius ( 2R ) is the same as the original maximum speed ( v ).The final answer is ( boxed{ v } )"},{"problem":"Given that 3sin β=sin (2a+β), find the value of frac{tan (a+β)}{tan a} ___________________ .","solution":"AnalysisThis problem involves the basic relationships of trigonometric functions and the trigonometric identities for the sum and difference of angles. From the given equation, we can derive frac{tan (a+β)}{tan a}=frac{3sin β}{cos (α+β)sin α}-1, where sin β=cos (α+β)sin α. We will use these expressions to find the answer.Step-by-step Solution1. Start with the given equation: 3sin β=sin (2a+β).2. Apply the sum of angles identity for sine on the right-hand side: sin (2a+β) = sin (a+β)cos a + cos (a+β)sin a.3. Substitute the expression from step 2 into the original equation: 3sin β = sin (a+β)cos a + cos (a+β)sin a.4. Rearrange the equation in step 3 to solve for frac{tan (a+β)}{tan a}:frac{tan (a+β)}{tan a} = frac{sin (a+β)cos a}{cos (a+β)sin a} = frac{3sin β - cos (a+β)sin a}{cos (a+β)sin a} = frac{3sin β}{cos (a+β)sin a} - 1.5. Now, let's find an expression for sin β. We can use the angle difference identity for sine: sin β=sin (β+α-α)=sin (α+β)cos α - cos (α+β)sin α.6. Observe that if we subtract the expression in step 5 from the expression in step 3, we get:2sin β = 2cos (α+β)sin α.7. Divide both sides by 2 to obtain: sin β = cos (α+β)sin α.8. Substitute the expression for sin β from step 7 into the equation for frac{tan (a+β)}{tan a} from step 4:frac{tan (a+β)}{tan a} = frac{3cos (α+β)sin α}{cos (a+β)sin a} - 1.9.

Initial Setup and Assumptions:   Given (a, b, c in mathbb{Z}^+) such that ((a^2 - 1, b^2 - 1, c^2 - 1) = 1), we need to prove that ((ab + c, bc + a, ca + b) = (a, b, c)).2. Divisibility in One Direction:   Clearly, ((a, b, c) mid (ab + c, bc + a, ca + b)). This is because any common divisor of (a, b, c) will also divide any linear combination of these terms.3. Defining (d):   Let (d = (ab + c, bc + a, ca + b)). We need to show that (d mid (a, b, c)).4. Divisibility by Linear Combinations:   We have:   [   d mid (a+1)(b+c), quad d mid (b+1)(c+a), quad d mid (c+1)(a+b)   ]   We aim to show that (d mid (a+b), (b+c), (c+a)).5. Prime Divisor Analysis:   Assume (d) has a prime divisor (p). Consider (p mid a+1). If (p mid b+1) and (p mid c+1), then ((a+1, b+1, c+1) geq p > 1), which contradicts ((a^2 - 1, b^2 - 1, c^2 - 1) = 1).6. Case Analysis:   - If (p mid a+1) but (p nmid b+1) and (p nmid c+1), then (p mid a+b) and (p mid a+c).   - Using (a equiv b equiv -1 pmod{p}), we get (p = 2). Thus, (a) and (b) are odd, making (c) even, which contradicts (p nmid ab + c).7. Contradiction and Conclusion:   - If (p mid a+1), then (p nmid b+1) and (p nmid c+1), leading to (p mid a+b) and (p mid a+c).   - This implies (p mid (a+1, b-1, c-1)), another contradiction.8. No Prime Divisor:   Therefore, no prime (p) divides (a+1, b+1, c+1), and thus (d mid a+b, b+c, c+a).9. Further Divisibility:   - (d mid ab + c implies d mid ab - b = a(b-1))   - Similarly, (d mid b(c-1)) and (d mid c(a-1))10. Prime Divisor Analysis Again:    - Assume (p mid a-1). Since ((a, a-1) = 1), (p mid d mid a(b-1)) implies (d mid b-1).    - Similarly, (d mid c-1), contradicting ((a^2 - 1, b^2 - 1, c^2 - 1) = 1).11. Final Conclusion:    No such prime (p) exists, so (d mid a, b, c).

Find the day when the number of squirrels caught exceeds the number of rabbits caught:   - We need to find the smallest ( n ) such that ( S_n > R_n ).   - Using the recurrence relations, we can express ( R_n ) and ( S_n ) in terms of ( n ):     [     R_n = 200 - 3(n-1) = 203 - 3n     ]     [     S_n = 18 + 2(n-1) = 16 + 2n     ]   - Set up the inequality ( S_n > R_n ):     [     16 + 2n > 203 - 3n     ]   - Solve for ( n ):     [     16 + 2n > 203 - 3n     ]     [     5n > 187     ]     [     n > 37.4     ]   - Since ( n ) must be an integer, we round up to get ( n = 38 ).4. Calculate the total number of rabbits caught up to and including day 38:   - The number of rabbits caught on day 38 is:     [     R_{38} = 203 - 3 times 38 = 203 - 114 = 89     ]   - The sequence of rabbits caught each day forms an arithmetic sequence with the first term ( a = 200 ) and the common difference ( d = -3 ).   - The sum of the first ( n ) terms of an arithmetic sequence is given by:     [     S_n = frac{n}{2} (2a + (n-1)d)     ]   - Substitute ( n = 38 ), ( a = 200 ), and ( d = -3 ):     [     S_{38} = frac{38}{2} (2 times 200 + (38-1)(-3))     ]     [     S_{38} = 19 (400 - 111)     ]     [     S_{38} = 19 times 289 = 5491     ]The final answer is (boxed{5491})"},{"problem":"Randomly select a number a from {1, 2, 3, 4, 5} and a number b from {1, 2, 3}.

Claim the answer is 7: We start by claiming that the minimum number of elements in ( B(x) ) for any irrational number ( x ) in the interval ( 0 < x < 1 ) is 7.2. Construct an example: Consider the number ( a = 0.100000100000010000000ldots ), where there are ( 5, 6, 7, ldots ) zeroes separating consecutive ones. We need to show that ( a ) is irrational and that ( B(a) ) has exactly 7 elements.3. Prove ( a ) is irrational: Suppose ( a ) is rational. Then ( a ) would eventually become periodic after some ( k )-th digit. Let the repeated part contain ( l ) digits. Since there are infinitely many sequences of more than ( 2l ) consecutive zeroes, at least one such sequence must occur after the ( k )-th digit. This implies that the repeated part must contain ( l ) zeroes, but there are also infinitely many ones, leading to a contradiction. Hence, ( a ) is irrational.4. Determine ( B(a) ): The set ( B(a) ) consists of all subsequences of 6 consecutive digits in the decimal expansion of ( a ). These subsequences are:   [   B(a) = {000000, 000001, 000010, 000100, 001000, 010000, 100000}   ]   This set has exactly 7 elements.5. Upper bound of 7: Since we have constructed an irrational number ( a ) with ( |B(a)| = 7 ), the minimum number of elements in ( B(x) ) for any irrational ( x ) must be at most 7.6. Prove ( |B(x)| leq 6 ) implies ( x ) is rational: We now show that if ( |B(x)| leq 6 ), then ( x ) must be rational. Let ( B_k(x) ) be the set of all subsequences of the decimal expansion of ( x ) with ( k ) digits. We claim that if ( |B_k(x)| leq k ), then ( x ) must be rational. We will prove this by induction on ( k ).   - Base case ( k = 1 ): If ( |B_1(x)| = 1 ), then ( x ) must be of the form ( 0.yyyldots = frac{y}{9} ) for some digit ( y ), which is rational.      - Inductive step: Assume the statement holds for ( k ). We need to show it holds for ( k + 1 ). If ( |B_{k+1}(x)| leq k + 1 ), then ( |B_k(x)| leq |B_{k+1}(x)| leq k + 1 ). If ( |B_k(x)| leq k ), then ( x ) is rational by the induction hypothesis. If ( |B_k(x)| = |B_{k+1}(x)| = k + 1 ), then each ( k )-digit sequence uniquely determines the next digit, leading to periodicity and thus rationality of ( x ).7. Conclusion: Since ( x ) is irrational, ( |B(x)| geq 7 ). Therefore, the minimum number of elements in ( B(x) ) for any irrational ( x ) is ( boxed{7} )."},{"problem":"8.

If x and y denote the quantities of substances X and Y respectively, then the derivative frac{d x}{d t} represents the rate of formation of substance X, and the derivative frac{d y}{d t} represents the rate of formation of substance Y. At any moment of time t, the quantity b of decomposed substance B is determined by the formula b=b_{0}-x-y, where b_{0} is the initial quantity of substance B. According to the problem, we obtain a system of two first-order differential equations:frac{d x}{d t}=kleft(b_{0}-x-yright), frac{d y}{d t}=lleft(b_{0}-x-yright)where k and l are proportionality coefficients.This system can be reduced to a single first-order differential equation. Indeed, dividing both sides of the second equation by the corresponding parts of the first equation, we getfrac{d y}{d x}=frac{l}{k}Solving this equation, we havey=frac{l}{k} x+C_{1}Using the initial conditions (x=0, y=0 when t=0), we find that C_{1}=0, so y=frac{l}{k} x. Substituting the obtained expression for y into the first equation of the original system, we get a first-order linear equationfrac{d x}{d t}+(k+l) x=k b_{0}The general solution of which isx=frac{k b_{0}}{k+l}+C_{2} e^{-(k+l) t}Since x=0 when t=0, we have C_{2}=-frac{k b_{0}}{k+l} andx=frac{k b_{0}}{k+l}left(1-e^{-(k+l) t}right)Substituting the obtained expression for x into the equation y=frac{l}{k} x, we find thaty=frac{l b_{0}}{k+l}left(1-e^{-(k+l) t}right)Now let's determine the values of the coefficients k and l. Since x=frac{b_{0}}{8} and y=frac{3 b_{0}}{8} when t=1, substituting these values into the expressions for x and y leads to the system of equations:frac{k}{k+l}left(1-e^{-(k+l)}right)=frac{1}{8} ; frac{l}{k+l}left(1-e^{-(k+l)}right)=frac{3}{8}Adding these equations term by term, we get1-e^{-(k+l)}=frac{1}{2}from whiche^{-(k+l)}=2^{-2} text { and } k+l=ln 2Dividing the second equation by the first term by term, we find l=3 k.Therefore, k=frac{1}{4} ln 2, l=frac{3}{4} ln 2.Thus, the desired solution is given by the formulas:x=frac{b_{0}}{4}left(1-frac{1}{2^{prime}}right) ; y=frac{3 b_{0}}{4}left(1-frac{1}{2^{prime}}right)## ProblemsFormulate differential equations from the conditions of the following problems and solve them.1.

If an odd number is represented as the sum of two natural numbers, then one of the addends is even, and the other is odd. If both addends are prime, then the even one must be 2. Therefore, these odd semiprime numbers have the form 2+p_{1}, 2+p_{2}, and 2+p_{3}. In this case, the numbers p_{1}, p_{2}, p_{3} are consecutive odd numbers.

Ariane and Bérénice are playing a game on the set of residue classes modulo n. At the beginning, the residue class 1 is written on a piece of paper. In each turn, the player whose turn it is replaces the current residue class x either by x+1 or by 2x. The two players take turns, with Ariane starting.Ariane wins if the residue class 0 is reached at any point during the game. Bérénice wins if she can prevent this indefinitely.Determine, depending on n, which of the two has a winning strategy.(Theresia Eisenkölbl)Answer. Ariane wins for n=2, 4, and 8, and Bérénice wins for all other n geq 2.","solution":"We first consider the cases n=2,3,4,6 and 8 individually and then show that Bérénice wins for all other n. All congruences in this solution are to be understood modulo n.- For n=2, Ariane moves to 0 in the first step and wins.- For n=3, Ariane is forced to move to 1+1=2 cdot 1=2 in the first step. Bérénice can then move to 2 cdot 2 equiv 1, thus Bérénice can enforce that the game alternates between 1 and 2 and never reaches 0. Therefore, Bérénice wins.- For n=4, Ariane moves to 2 in the first step again. Bérénice must then choose between 2+1=3 and 2 cdot 2=4. If she chooses 4 equiv 0, she immediately loses. If she chooses 3, Ariane can win in the next step by choosing 3+1=4 equiv 0. Thus, Ariane has a winning strategy.- For n=6, Bérénice wins with optimal play, as she can avoid the number ever being divisible by 3 using the strategy for n=3.- For n=8, Ariane moves to 2 in the first step again. If Bérénice chooses 4, Ariane can immediately win by choosing 8 equiv 0. If Bérénice chooses 3, Ariane can choose 6. If Bérénice then chooses 7, Ariane wins with 7+1=8 equiv 0. If Bérénice chooses 2 cdot 6=12 equiv 4, Ariane wins with 2 cdot 4=8 equiv 0. Thus, Ariane wins with optimal play.Now let n geq 2 with n neq 2,3,4,6 or 8. Ariane certainly does not win in the first step, as 2 not equiv 0. If Bérénice can permanently avoid choosing n, n-1, or n / 2 (if n is even), then Ariane can never win. We need to check for which number x on the paper Bérénice is forced to choose one of these numbers in the next step because both of her options are on this list.If x+1 is congruent to one of the numbers n, n-1, or n / 2, then 4x is congruent to -4 or -8. If 2x is congruent to one of the numbers n, n-1, or n / 2, then 4x is congruent to 0 or -2. Therefore, both options can only be unfavorable if n divides one of the differences 2, 4, 6, or 8 between the described values for 4x. However, we have already handled all these divisors separately.Thus, Bérénice is never forced to choose 0 or to give Ariane the opportunity to choose 0 for n neq 2,3,4,6 or 8. Therefore, Ariane can never win for these numbers. Bérénice's winning strategy is simply to avoid the numbers n, n-1, and n / 2 and otherwise play arbitrarily.(Theresia Eisenkölbl)"},{"problem":"Draw a tangent line to the circle (x-1)^{2}+(y-1)^{2}=1 passing through the point P(2,4).

When discussing cases, it is important to consider the problem comprehensively to ensure completeness and exclusivity.When the slope of the tangent line does not exist, the line x=2 meets the requirements; when the slope of the tangent line exists, set the tangent line equation, and use the distance d=r from the center of the circle to the tangent line to establish an equation about k, solve the equation to find the value of k, and determine the tangent line equation at this time. In summary, the equation of the tangent line that meets the requirements is obtained.SolutionConsider two cases: If the slope of the tangent line does not exist, then the line x=2 meets the requirements;If the slope of the tangent line exists, let it be k,Then the equation of the tangent line is y-4=k(x-2),Which simplifies to kx-y+4-2k=0,Since the line is tangent to the circle,The distance d from the center of the circle (1,1) to the tangent line equals the radius r,So, dfrac{|k-1+4-2k|}{sqrt{k^{2}+1}}=1, solving this gives k= dfrac{4}{3},At this point, the equation of the tangent line is 4x-3y+4=0,In summary, the equation of the tangent line is either x=2 or 4x-3y+4=0.Therefore, the answer is boxed{x=2 text{ or } 4x-3y+4=0}."},{"problem":"In the diagram, each of the 15 small squares is going to be coloured.
