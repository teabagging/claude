Mental tension is one thing that promotes infertility besides other factors. More over there is no ovulation so it may take time for your desire to come true. Anaemia is also one of the causes of irregular periods, and infertility. Regarding yasmin tablets , they are birth controle pills, but they will also help for treating P.C.O.D by suppressing the cysts. So you can use the pills with out any doubt. Besides i advise you some non medical procedures as Diversion procedures yoga, meditation, reading books, hearing music, and if interested gardening. Take more of green leafy vegetables, pulses, sprouts, egg, milk, meat etc to improve blood, and general health necessory for  all deeds.

It is all in the hands of God. Some men feel very week, some complain of dizziness, some get hypertensive yet others irritant as they start taking the medicines to increase the sperm count. A husband should be given high protein diet, energy giving food like legumes, beans, eggs, red meat, dairy products, nuts, fruits, veggies, berries so that the medicine works well and brings the desired results. The medicine may take 4-6 months to show results. It is better to maintain abstinence while the husband is under treatment.  To be able to conceive the spermatozoa should be atleast 20 million/ml, 75% should be alive, atleat 50% active, 30% normal. There is no harm in trying donor systems as confidentiality is maintained and results are positive. Acceptance and mental preparation depends upon both the husband and wife else it may ruin life. You can try visiting Holy places, Nagapatnam and many other places if you are a believer.

She has chronic abdominal pain, and has been a bit worse the last few days.","Doctor":"Hello!Welcome on HCM!Regarding your concern, I would explain that in case your daughter experiences such a low blood pressure for the first time and can not tolerate such conditions (she feels extremely exhausted and is not able to perform her daily physical activity), then you should take her to the nearest ER service for a timely fluid hydration (intravenous perfusion) and preliminary laboratory workup. It i necessary to investigate the real nature of her chronic anemia (hemolysis, a chronic inflammatory disease, etc.) as it may explain the reason of her chronic abdominal pain (visceral organs enlargement, etc.)Several lab tests should be done:- complete blood count,- PCR & ESR,- thyroid hormones level,- liver and renal function tests,- abdominal ultrasound,- fasting blood glucose,- hemoglobin electrophoresis, etc.You should discuss with her attending doctor on the above mentioned issues.Hope to have been helpful to you!Kind regards,Dr. Iliri"},{"Patient":"Hi Dr s, I am omar and we have been trying for child for last 8 months but my wife didn t get pregnant.

For successful pregnancy it should be atleast 7 mm. If endo thickness is persistently less during IUI cycles then you should undergo diagnostic hysteroscopy ( where uterine cavity is directly visualized using a camera ) and also endometrial biopsy need to be taken to rule out tuberculosis. If everything comes out to be normal then there are certain medicines which can be used to improve endo thickness with mixed success like estradiol valerate, arginine, vit E , pentoxyphylline , sildenafil. You can discuss options with your treating doctor. You can proceed for one or two more cycle of IUI with stimulation by gonadotropin injections instead of clomiphene . If these treatment also fail then IVF and surrogacy are last options. For husband's problem IUI with donor sperms can be done.

His blood pressure was >180/115 on three separate days. Further examination showed normal to low plasma renin activity, elevated total peripheral resistance (TPR), cardiac output (CO) of 7.2 L/min, x-ray evidence of left ventricular hypertrophy, retinal hemorrhages, and mild polyuria. Recommended therapy was weight reduction to his ideal level, a low-salt diet (<2 gm/day sodium), prudent exercise, and a reduction in alcohol consumption (<3 oz whiskey/day). This change in lifestyle did little to change the condition. Medication was initiated in the form of an oral diuretic and progressed to a beta-blocker; eventually a vasodilator was included to reduce the blood pressure to <140/90. 1. What is the diagnosis for this individual?","Doctor":"Hello and welcome,It is highly likely he has renal parenchymal disease caused by hypertention.Hypertension (HTN) starts with increased resistance to blood flow (total peripheral resistance) that causes decreased blood flow to the kidneys. Kidneys start to produce renine which eventually converted to angiotensin to increase the blood flow.  When the kidney is damaged (hypertension can be either a cause or a consequence) the kidney can not produce renin (low levels). Patients with kidney damage (renal parenchymal disease) have high serum creatinine and decreased creatinine clearance which is diagnostic of the condition. The patient's left ventricular hypertrophy, retinal hemorrages (end organ damage) shows uncontrolled HTN damaging those organs which might have affected his kidneys as well. Kidney damage can be diagnosed by studying serum creatinine, creatinine clearance and renal ultrasonography. Other than kidney damage certain endocrine pathologies (very rare) may cause high blood pressure and low renin. Adrenal gland problem (hyperaldosteronism) causes HTN, low potassium, low renin and high aldosterone which can be initially diagnosed by obtaining renin and aldosteron levels.I hope the above information will be helpful for you.

As m on treatment i always take metfromin fro my periods. i have irregular periods and PCOs. should i have to take these medicines sp primolut?","Doctor":"Hello yellowtulip24, Welcome to healthcaremagic. There are many issues involved in your post. Let me try and solve them one by one. If your period was expected on the 4th, its too early to check with pregnancy tests on 5th. One should wait at least 3 days after missed period to do Urine Pregnancy Test. You posted your questions today. Did you do a pregnancy test after the 5th and when? If not, please check FIRST morning sample of urine for pregnancy tomorrow morning. Even if you have irregular periods, don't get complacent and presume that this cycle too it must be irregular. It could be a pregnancy since Metformin not only helps in reducing weight but regularizes the cycle by causing an egg release. The low abdomen pain - if your preganacy test is positive tomorrow morning, please get a Transvaginal ultrasound asap to rule out a pregnancy in the tube. Get in touch with your local doctor for this. Ranitidine is an anti- acid preparation which research has shown to be safe even in pregnant women. Folic Acid is important to prevent abnormalities in the baby and its always best to start when planning pregnancy i.e. even before pregnancy is conceived. I do not know what doses of Primolut-N you have been prescribed. You may have been prescribed this for 5-10 days to get a withdrawl period. Please rule out pregnancy by a latest urine test before taking this. If a patient is pregnant we like to use other forms of hormones to support pregnancy. Generally Primolut-N is not used for this purpose. In short, if you are definitely not pregnant, its safe and ok to use Primolute-N. The other 2 medicines mentioned are safe anyways. Hope this answers your queries satisfactorily."},{"Patient":"Dear doctor, I am 33 years old married man I have two baby girls but unfortunately due to numerous puss cells in my semen my sperm count reduced to 35 million/cmm and motility reduced to 20%.thats why i am unable to fertile my wife and also facing problem in erection of penis.

I have not conceived even a once till now. I consulted so many doctors. Everywhere the reports are normal for me and my husband both. But few days back a doctor suggested me for AMH test. It was 20th day of my periods. The result was 9.56pM/L. what does this finding suggest? What are my chances of getting pregnant in future?","Doctor":"Hi, AMH stands for Anti-Mullerian Hormone. AMH is produced directly by the ovarian follicles and therefore AMH levels correlate with the number of antral follicles in the ovaries . It has been documented that women with lower AMH have lower antral follicular counts and produce a lower number of oocytes (eggs) compared with women with higher levels. AMH levels do not change significantly throughout the menstrual cycle and it usually decrease with age. Healthy women, below 38 years old, with normal follicular status at day 3 of the menstrual cycle, have AMH levels of 2.0 - 6.8 ng/ml (14.28 - 48.55 pmol/L). High levels are found in patients with Polycystic  ovaries. Now, in your case AMH is low suggesting that your egg count is less. AMH cannot be improved by medication. Therefore i would suggest you to start your treatment at the earliest with an infertility specialist rather than waiting  for natural conception. Your doctor will explain the best mode of treatment to get you pregnant at the earliest, based on your other test reports.

Regarding your question about planning for conception, I would suggest you to meet your endocrinologist for better control of your hyperthyroidism before pregnancy. If your doctor advises you radioactive iodine then delay conception of atleast for 6 months. You need to understand that hyperthyroidism if not controlled before pregnancy is harmful for you and also your baby. It may by itself be the cause for infertility. Do not discontinue your medication while you are trying for pregnancy (once your hormone levels are well controlled ), as these medications are safe in pregnancy.But once you are pregnant meet your endocrinologist to modify your drug and its dosage. Severe and untreated hyperthyroidism is associated with menstrual irregularities and infertility(inhibition of ovulation). Those who do become pregnant have a significant increased rate of miscarriage, intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR), premature labour and also  higher risk of fetal mortality. For women with mild hyperthyroidism and those with good control by anti-thyroid drugs, the maternal and foetal outcomes are usually good and  are unaffected by the disease."},{"Patient":"sir, i had laproscopy and tried for 2 cycles of IUIs(unsucessful). in the next month (aug/2011) of 2nd IUI I had a pregnancy naturally but in 10 weeks no fetal heart is seen and that is ended with D&C in sept.after 8 months i missed my period and got +ve preg test.my doctor adviced me to take bedrest and medications like HCG 5000units weekly twice, profine and doxinateplus, asprin etc. but in 9weeks USG there is nothing and bleeding started from the next day. sir, please suggest us the next step of our treatment.now i am 34 and my husband is 35yrs old padma","Doctor":"Hi Padma, you have conceived twice and that's a good sign.

This is not a serious problem in the sense that you are not really ill but you may be having any of these 5 features of PCOS, in alone or combination - obesity; no release of egg; delayed periods; infertility and male features like excessive hair growth on beard and moustache area, oily skin, acne. The treatment prescribed by your doctor will help you in decreasing weight and in normalizing the insulin resistance. Give it 2-3 months more and you may conceive by yourself. Remember to have intercourse in the fertile period during this time. The fertile period is from 8th day from start of period for next ten days. Have intercourse every alternate day. Daily intercourse may decrease the quality of sperms in the semen. To help you conceive you can also take egg releasing medicines for 5 days. Discuss this aspect with your doctor who will then prescribe it. The chances of your conceiving are high so don't worry. Since the egg is released only once in a month, every time its not released or it has not been able to fertilize, you have to wait for next cycle. This may lead to great upset but if you understand the reason behind it, it makes it easier to wait for conception to occur month after month.

For your help, I am giving you the normal sperm analysis as given by World Health Organization (WHO). Compare yours with that of WHO standard.“Normal” sperm count, as defined by the WHO, is characterized by: The concentration of spermatozoa should be at least 20 million/mL. The total volume of semen should be at least 2 mL. The total number of spermatozoa in the ejaculate should be at least 40 million.At least 75% of the spermatozoa should be alive (it is normal for up to 25% to be dead). At least 30% of the spermatozoa should be of normal shape and form.At least 25% of the spermatozoa should be swimming with rapid forward movement.At least 50% of the spermatozoa should be swimming forward, even if only sluggishly. These numbers amount to averages; having a sperm count below these numbers does not guarantee that a man will be unable to father a child; likewise, having a sperm count higher than these numbers does not guarantee that a man will be able to father a child.Hope I have answered your query.

Yes it can be one of the reason for infertility. AMH( ante mullerian harmone) indicates your egg quantity and FSH is an harmone for predicting the quality of egg. However these test are not the definitive test. AMH decreases with increasing age. Any treatment is unlikely to increase your AMH level significantly.

Since you are having an irregular spotting in this cycle, it is likely to be due to mild hormonal imbalance. In my opinion, you should not take clomiphene in this cycle.

Two cycles of Clomid + Bravelle shots and one IUI and one natural intercourse failed. On my third cycle, after taking Provera for 10 days, I waited 14 days and had no period. An u/s showed that my lining was thin enough, so the doc started me on Clomid 100 for 5 days, followed by one shot of Bravelle 150. The follicle slowly grew to 8mm, so a second shot of Bravelle 100 was given to me. The very next day I had bleeding and for two days, I shed bright red blood. It wasn t particularly heavy and stopped after 2 days and 2 nights. U/s showed the lining had thinned considerably but was still 3 layers thick. The follicle was nowhere to be seen. My question is: a) What just happened there? Did I have a period mid-cycle? b) I haven t lost any weight on metformin. I used to have diarrhoea-style stools for several weeks after I started but these have now stabilized. But it doesn t look like metformin has helped at all. I am 5 3 tall and about 205 lbs. Could someone help me figure out what s happening with my body?

I have hypertension, high cholesterol, CAD, mild asthma which is brought on by irritants, Hashimoto s Thyroiditis, and Diverticulosis (I had a colon resection 4 1/2 years ago). I often get terrible muscle cramps in my lower legs, but I have also been experiencing this feeling of pulsating (it almost feels like something is crawling inside my lower legs) and you can actually see it puckering. I ve also had a few episodes of extreme dizziness, immediately followed by swooning (feeling like I was going to pass out), and simultaneous tingling & numbness in my lips, fingers & toes. These may be two completely different problems, but for all I know, they could be related. Any insight you could give me would be much appreciated!","Doctor":"Hello!Welcome and thank you for asking on HCM!I passed carefully through your question and would explain as follows: 1- The muscle cramps and pulsating feeling in your legs could be related to pripheral arteriopathy or neuropathy. For this reason, I would recommend performing a Doppler ultrasound of the leg vessels and a nerve conduction study to examine the nerves in the lower limbs. 2- The episodes of fainting  and numbness in your lips could be related to blood pressure fluctuations or orthostatic hypotension. That is why, it is necessary to closely monitor your blood pressure values and performing a Head Up Tilt test to investigate for orthostatic hypotension. You should discuss with your doctor on the above tests.

But variety of factors (infections, autoimmune diseases) may cause pericarditis and your doctor may prescribe additional treatment according to the etiology of the disease.Other causes of dyspnea and chest discomfort are: -heart failure -cardiomyopathies-endocarditis-valvular problems  (probably your doctors have ruled out these conditions with echocardiogram)-myocarditis-ischemic heart disesase-heart rhythm disturbances (holter monitor should detect it rare rhythm disturbances)-gastroesophageal reflux disease and other esophageal pathologies (you might need endoscopic evaluation) -obstructive and restrictive lung disease (spirometry)-pulmonary hypertention Ordering additional tests depends on your previous test results and physical exam findings.

In Mar 12 and Apr 12 here date was around 28 - 29 of each month. Based on this we calculated the ovulation date (which as per our knowledge is around 14 days before the period date) to be around 14 - 15 of May. We tried during this time and my wife missed the date of 29 last month and the period started on 3 June 12.

After the sex session on each occasion we have observed that my discharge flows back out from my wife vargina. We generally clean it with a cloth. Is this a natural behaviour? I am not sure if any discharge ever stay inside. What can be done in this case. 3. Does regular excercise even during the ovulation time safe or does is also result in not conceiving.

As you have undergone ovarian drilling I would suggest you to undergo test for FSH and AMH to know the store of eggs in your ovary. You may need ovulation induction with clomiphene, follicular monitoring and then IUI ( if ovulation is occurring from favorable side) to increase your chances. If you are not responding even with maximum dose of clomiphene then you may require gonadotropin injections followed by IUI. You can try 3-6 cycles of IUI and if there is no success then you should think of IVF treatment.

Different labs all over the world have different grading system for embryo. Grade A appears to be of good quality embryo. Do you know the embryo quality during previous failures?? Which day embryo was transferred and what was the cell stage...then I ll be able to answer you precisely. According to your history it appears as implantation failure. Have you undergone hysteroscopy for uterine cavity evaluation?? You can do all your routine activities after embryo transfer but there should not be any physical or mental stress. You should keep vaginal progesterone capsules deep inside the vagina and continue all your medicines as instructed. Absolute bed rest is not necessary after ET. Hot or cold shower have nothing to do with implantation.

If you wish to have a baby, a test called the sperm survival test is done. If there are >3 million motile sperms/ml after this, then there is no problem.

A woman generally has  the same chances of conception whether you have one ovary or two, as long as the remaining one is attached to a fallopian tube. The main thing to watch for when you want to get pregnant and only have one ovary is ovulation. When a woman has two ovaries, they typically take turns releasing an egg every month. If there's only one, then it usually takes over for the missing one and releases an egg each menstrual cycle, and a period should still occur. There may be some other reason for not getting pregnant. You can wait for few months more and if unsuccessful still,you can consult your doctor to find the cause for it.

Egg is present within the growing follicle and for complete maturity of egg, follicular size should be more than 18mm. In your case on 10 th day it is 16*12 ( mean 14mm). Usually follicle grows 1-2 mm/day. Here follicular size has not increased from 10th to 12th day. Endometrial thickness of 7.6mm is good. NDF means no dominant follicle in left ovary.

What shall i do for my betterment.","Doctor":"Hi Welcome to HealthcareMagic As you are 42 yrs old, chances of conceiving naturally is low because as age advances quality of egg becomes poor and fertility decreases. Your periods are irregular which suggests there is hormonal disturbance. As age advances store of eggs in ovaries also decrease. You need aggressive treatment rather than waiting for things to happen. I would suggest you to undergo 1-2 cycles of IUI combined with ovulation induction( Ovofar treatment ) and if it is unsuccessful IVF treatment will be best option. Even with IVF, success rate is low at your age. Other option is IVF with donor eggs which has good success rate.

Please i need your candid advise, on this. I need to start having kids as soon as possible. Thanks. Doris.","Doctor":"Hi Doris Welcome to HealthcareMagic As you told you have PCOS and one fallopian tube is also blocked. PCOS is a common problem among women which leads to infertility. Every month only one egg comes out of the ovary and available for fertilization but you cant predict which side ovary will ovulate. As you told one side tube is blocked and if ovulation occurs that side only then chances of pregnancy will be very low. You need to undergo follicular monitoring (By ultrasound) to see growth of egg and side of ovulation. If ovulation is occurring from favorable side then  there is chance of pregnancy . As you have PCOS I would suggest you to undergo certain hormonal tests like LH,FSH, Testosterone ,DHEAS ( Also s.prolactin n TSH) etc.. and if there is disturbance of hormones then it need to be treated accordingly. You have not mentioned about your age and weight. I would suggest you to lose weight if you are overweight by diet control and exercise. Get your blood sugar checked as it also has adverse effect on fertility. M2 tone and folic acid can be continued. You need to take tab clomiphene to induce ovulation, do follicular monitoring to see growth of egg and side of ovulation and then try by timed intercourse or IUI.

Please","Doctor":"Hi Anitha Welcome to HealthcareMagic Azoospermia is not incurable. First of all azoospermia need to be evaluated whether it is due to block in tubes or there is no production of sperms at all. If azoospermia is due to block in tubes ( Obstructive ) then sperm can be collected from testis through a needle(PESA/TESA). Even when there is no block in tubes and sperms are absent there are chances of getting sperms with the above procedure. After getting the sperms IVF/ICSI can be done. when all these fail and you want to have your own baby , you have patience and finance is not a concern then you can even opt for Micro-TESE. Micro-TESE is new technique in which sperms are retrieved by a surgery and then surgery can be done.. Before all these your husband need to be evaluated thoroughly by a urologist and hormonal investigations to be done.

Thanks for the query. Have you put on weight recently ? Any hair growth on your chin recently ? There could be many causes for delayed periods like emotional stress, lack of sleep, hormonal disorders like Polycystic ovarian disease or PCOD, ovarian disorders etc. Eat a balanced diet. Drink 1-2 litres of water daily. Do daily brisk walking for 40 minutes a day. Do Yoga everyday. Sleep for 6-8 hours a day. Try to reduce stress at work by taking frequent breaks or reducing work hours. All this will reduce stress and help in maintaining normal menstrual cycles. You will need to consult a Gynecologist and get an ultrasound scan of your pelvic organs including ovaries, uterus. This will be able to find out any problems with these organs. You may also require to test hormones like FSH, LH, Estrogen, Progesterone, Androstenedione, Thyroid hormones as all these can affect periods and fertility as well. If pregnancy test is negative, it is usually correct. If you have doubts, kindly get Beta hCG level tested at a Hospital as this is more accurate to diagnose pregnancy.

I have gone through your query. People with anovulatory cycles often tend to have irregular periods. But anovulatory cycles are seen even in people with regular periods. One of the most important cause of anovulatory cycles is PCOD ( which you have been diagnosed with). In  people with ovulatory cycles , periods occur due to progesterone withdrawal. But in people with anovulatory cycles periods occur due to Estrogen withdrawal. Getting treated for PCOD shall solve your problem. For conceiving ovulation is essential. As you are planning to conceive, using ovulation induction drugs like Clomiphene citrate will help in maturation of follicle. Alternatively taking HCG injections also induce ovulation.

That means if you expect your menses on 30th of a particular month then you will be ovulating on 16th of that month. Your ovum must be viable for atleast 24 to 72 hrs. So during this period you can do serial trans vaginal ultra sound to monitor ovum release and its maturation. Your husband' s semen analysis report is relatively normal. Both of you now dont need any medicines. You need perfect relaxation, rest, nutritious food and keep your mind out of tension. Having sex at the time of ovulation and upto 3 days after ovulation is very important... Wish you both all the best..

It is associated with very low levels of fertility or even sterility, but many forms are amenable to medical treatment. Azoospermia can be classified into three major types as listed. 1...Pretesticular azospermia is characterized by inadequate stimulation of otherwise normal testicles and genital tract. Typically, follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) levels are low (hypogonadotropic) commensurate with inadequate stimulation of the testes to produce sperm. Examples include hypopituitarism (for various causes), hyperprolactinemia, and exogenous FSH suppression by testosterone. 2  testicular azospermia.In this situation the testes are abnormal, atrophic, or absent, and sperm production severely disturbed to absent. FSH levels tend to be elevated (hypergonadotropic) as the feedback loop is interrupted. The condition is seen in 49-93% of men with azoospermia 3...In posttesticular azoospermia sperm are produced but not ejaculated, a condition that affects 7-51% of azoospermic men. The main cause is a physical obstruction (obstructive azoospermia) of the posttesticular genital tracts. in these conditions sperm are produced but not expelled. Pre- and post-testicular azoospermia a frequently correctible, while testicular azoospermia is usually permanent. A major advancement in recent years has been the introduction of IVF with ICSI which allows successful fertilization even with immature sperm or sperm obtained directly from testicular tissue. IVF-ICSI allows for pregnancy in couples where the man has irreversible testicular azoospermia as long as it is possible to recover sperm material from the testes. Don't loose hope and consult a urologist for proper evaluation of your condition and ultimately some way can be found for you to attain fatherhood. Best of luck.

Taking a supplement, as well as eating foods rich in folate will ensure blood levels of this vital vitamin are sufficiently high, before and during pregnancy. Fertility health requires all the benefits this supplement can provide. Advances in infertility have proved that this essential supplement should be taken throughout this phase, after all, in most cases, infertility is temporary, and conception is possible at any time. Folate (referred to as folic acid) is a B vitamin that is essential for metabolism and the production of DNA. Deficiencies in the vitamin can lead to problems with cell division and the making of protein, as well as certain types of birth defects. There is also evidence that a folate deficiency may increase the risk of coronary heart disease, stroke and colon cancer.

Ovulatory dysfunction, non response to ovulatory drugs, quality of ova produced, , and medical complications increase with age. 2. TB of uterus reduces the ability of your endometrium to prepare the bed for the fertilized embryo even with IVF. IVF bypasses the abnormality of tubes only. 3. Usually TB of womb is accompanied by TB of tubes also, and it affects its structure, fimbrial pick up , and patency. 4. Even after successful management of TB of womb, structural damage does not revert back to normal.

You can talk to your doctor for assisted conception techniques which may offer you the chance of having a child again. Assisted conception treatments include: Intrauterine insemination (IUI), IVF (in vitro fertilization), Intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI). In IUI  sperm are inserted directly into your uterus (womb) at the time of ovulation. In  IVF, eggs are gathered from your ovaries and combined with your partner's sperm in a laboratory dish. The resulting embryos are transplanted into your uterus. In ICSI, a single sperm is injected straight into a single egg in the laboratory and the resulting embryo is transplanted into your uterus. Talk to your doctors regarding all these options and i hope you will definetly conceive again. Have patience and keep a positive attitude. Hope this will help you. Best regards.

We are married for 2 years and we are trying for concieve for the past 4 months. We are working in two different places and hence we were together only for a few days each month. Now i am on a long leave to try for conception . As a start, my husband did a semen analysis on tuesday which came out with a report showing zero sperm count. He took the sample from home, and transported it to the lab in an air conditioned vehicle and it took almost 30 mnts delay. Are there chances that due to this the sperm could have died off by the time it reached the lab?? Just to know if there is any such kind of chances and the sample collection guidelines that should be followed while collecting semen samples.? We areanyways planning to repeat the test in another lab tommorrow.","Doctor":"Hello Your chances of conception will increase once you start staying together regularly.however a zero sperm count is a cause for worry for which get the semen tested again at some different lab. How to collect semen sample If you collected your sample in a place other than your clinic, you need to get it to the laboratory within one hour after ejaculation because sperm do not have a long life outside of the body and at different temperatures. Delays in delivering semen and exposure to various temperatures will results in lower overall motile sperm count and poor semen cryopreservation. Your semen sample shouldn’t be exposed to any extreme temperatures and, in fact, should be kept as close to body temperature as possible. The sperm motility value will be inaccurately low if the semen sample gets cold and or if it gets too hot. Keep your specimen container upright in a plastic bag, with the lid securely tightened. The specimen should not be placed in your partner’s purse, or in your pocket or briefcase. Keep it as close to your body as possible, perhaps by tucking it under your clothing on the way to the clinic. You will need to refrain from any sexual activity for at least two days, but not more than 10 days before you collect your sample. This means no sex or no ejaculation of any kind, including masturbation. Longer or shorter periods of abstinence may result in a lower sperm count or decreased sperm motility. Samples produced after two days of abstinence will usually have the highest numbers of motile sperm with the greatest forward velocity, when compared to samples produced after shorter or longer abstinence.

After several days they went down with a scope and discovered that it was very eroded and had ulcers. The biopsy came back indicating MRSA and a yeast infection. They began tube feeding her a few days later. At that point she was down to 73 pounds. They started her on an antibiotic for internal MRSA. After 14 days they stopped the antibiotic but she still has pain on swallowing. The hospital feels that she needs to go for long term hospital care somewhere else. The insurance will not approve it.

TB is important cause of infertility, if not treated properly, risk of TB even to baby may be much more than risk with antibiotics.

In your case, you know that you can get pregnant, but this is made harder by the problems related to your tubes.You CAN get pregnant from the right tube, even if you ovulate for the left ovary. In your case, and given your relatively young age, what I would recommend is: 1. Continue with regular attempts at conception 2. Consider ovulation predictor kits (bought at any drug store) 3. If you have no success by about 10 months, then call your doctor for an appointment as you approach the 12 month mark 4. Consider that you might need IVF.

Unfortunately, our first iui attempt has failed. I have gone through my second one on 12/04/2012. Ofcourse, i used to to take clomid 50 gm and took 6 injections so far. After the iui procedure, i did not experience any severe or negative side effects. However, 5 days later i started to experience some bloating and abdominal pain and a day later i have encountered some pink bleeding spots that actually stopped the next day! my doctor has prescribed me duphaston two tablets a day! she told me that in case there is a baby, duphaston will keep it safe. However, after i started taking duphaston, my bloating became so severe and my tummy became so swollen and i gained 4 kgs! i look like a 6months old pregnant woman..as well, i am unable to walk or move properly due to the severe pain and swelling. I noticed that iam drinking alot of water and the water is not going out of my body. when i went to check with my doctor, she told me that i am experiencing over stimulation symptoms due to the hormonal injections that i used to take. as well, i am experiencing water retention for the first time.

Semen test showed that my husband has a low motility and low morphology. All my blood test came positive. So the diagnosis was male factor teratozoospermia. We tried 3 IUI , then 3 IVF and then 3 frozen cycles, none of them took for us. Then we changed clinic and did a 4th IVF, I became pregnant but in the wrong place. It was an ectopic pregnancy and I had to be operated. Both my tubes were removed. The surgeon told us that the tubes looked infected and that is why they removed both of them. After the surgery we again tried several IVF cycles and none of them succeeded. Around 10 years back, when I was in my college days, I had acute lower abdomen pain with white discharge and I was diagnosed with tuberculosis, and was given anti TB medicine for 9/10 months. After the treatment the white discharge problem disappeared. At that point of time the doctors didnt mention anything about the possibility of infertility in the future. But I am wondering if my tubes were infected due to TB at that time and if I am facing infertility now due to this. Just before the ectopic pregnancy I underwent a hysteroscopy and I was told that the uterus looked normal. A tissue was sent for biopsy and the result came out clean. I am not sure if I there is any point in me continuing to take IVFs. Other than the ectopic pregnancy I have never become pregnant even once. Please let me know if my previous TB treatment could be a cause for this and if there is any hope for me to get pregnant through IVF. I am in great agony after such a long journey in the infertile road.","Doctor":"Hi Welcome to HCM, Unfortunately TB of Tubes causes structural damage to the tubes. Inspite of successful treatment for TB, structural damage does not revert back to normal. In majority of cases of TB of Tubes, uterus also gets affected.  In fact, the Doctor should have removed your tubes befoe your First IVF. Hysteroscopy is a good diagnostic  investigation, but again it has its limitations. Biopsy also depends on the quality of sampling, and it can rule out active TB, but the capacity to prepare a bed for fertilized ova to implant is another thing. Male factor also has an important implication on success of fertility. As the age increases, again the chances of Succecc of IVF reduces. Nevertheless, we should not lose hope. You as a couple should talk to the Doctor, and discuss about other options also."},{"Patient":"i am 33yrs old, married for over 3yrs but did not conceive. all my medical tests are normal. my husband's SA reads 27million per mil for sperm count while all other parameters are normal. pls does anyone knows where d problem lies?","Doctor":"Hi..

I went with Diane 35 option. Before taking diane my testosterones was 0.84 but after taking the medication when it was tested now it was 1.5. I m really worried . I have my regular periods even before taking Diane. I want to ask that why it got high even after taking medication and if now I go for pregnyl Will there be any issues?","Doctor":"Hi, Welcome to Healthcare Magic. The rise in Testosterone levels could be due to the PCO itself and unlikely due to the drug. You can continue the treatment as prescribed. You can also opt for ovulation enhancing medication like clomiphene once your hormone levels are normal. This will increase the chances of pregnancy and reduce PCO. There would not be any adverse effects now if you continue the same treatment. Take care.

Fertilization occurs in the tube and the fertilized egg is transported into the uterine cavity where it gets embedded and the baby grows over there.I think that now it must be clear to you that ovulation and tubes are different things. Ovulation can occur even if the tubes are blocked but the transportation will not be successful if the tubes are blocked. If both the tubes are completely blocked then ovum and sperm cannot unite and hence pregnancy is not possible in natural way.

Hw can i control my bp besides taking prevention.","Doctor":"Hello!Welcome and thank you for asking on HCM!I passed carefully through your question and would explain that single spikes of blood pressure are not indicative of uncontrolled high blood pressure. They could be related to physical activity or emotional stress. Coming to this point, I would recommend you to closely monitor your blood pressure frequently during the day (in sitting position after 10 minutes of total relax) and refer those values to your GP. If your blood pressure values are frequently high, making some changes to your therapy may be needed. I would also recommend performing some tests to investigate for secondary causes of high blood pressure: -a chest X ray study- complete blood count- kidney and liver function tests- fasting glucose- blood electrolytes- PCR, ESR for inflammation- thyroid hormone levels for thyroid dysfunction- cortisol and aldosterone for adrenal gland dysfunction- an abdominal ultrasound to examine the renal arteries. You should discuss with your doctor on the above tests. Meanwhile, I would recommend some lifestyle changes to help maintain a normal blood pressure naturally: - reduce salt and caffeine intake- perform regularly physical activity (walking, aeorbics, etc.)- try to lose some pounds if you are overweight.

Tension and depression will only reduce your chances of pregnancy. Ovulation (release of the egg from the ovary) usually occurs around 14 days before the expected date of the next period.

First and foremost, one needs to check if they are 1. Intermittent or persistent 2. Regular or irregular 3. Aggravated by physical exertion or relieved by rest.4. you also need to narrow down to heart only after ruling out thyroid disorders or severe anemia The symptoms of light headedness occur because when your heart beats rapidly it is not able to supply adequate blood to your brain and this is percieved as giddiness or can even cause transient loss of consciousness.

This was a traumatic event, however it was proceeded by further trauma in his battle with alcohol, psychologically abusive attitude, in particular to my mother and other events which caused long term stress to the whole family. Since the 23rd of August I have experienced chest pains coming and going, though not severe pain, it has been a more uncomfortable feeling than severe pain. I have deduced that it is exacerbated by pain which eliminated my initial thought that it was strain in the muscle of the chest after an incident with my brother. My family has a history of high blood pressure on my father's side and I tend to keep track of my BP with my own monitor. I have had two med students measure my bp in the last two days and I have found conflicted readings with my own readings. They both yielded results of between 150 and 158 on the Systolic and between 80 and 100 diastolic. I have found that the results are between 125 and 130 over around 70-80, with a strong pulse of around 70. One of the main reasons I have not visited a GP is a lack of understanding of the procedures seeing a gp/ doctor in the US. Please advise me on the best course of action.","Doctor":"HiI have understood your query well.Normal B.P is systolic 100 to 130 and diastolic 80 to 90  ( according to latest american heart association guidlines )any meausurments above it is hypertension . so according to your measurement your blood pressure is within normal limit. but it's high when checked by med student .

In your case I would advise you to go retrospectively , that is we follow an approach of treating the common cause of obesity rather than attributing it to the drug.1. Look if you are taking some other meds which have a clear association with weight gain 2. Get your lipid, sugar and thyroid profiles done as they are commonly associated 3.

Improving sperm motility is possible when changes to life style and diet are implemented. You must take a lot of water and diet rich in vitamins like vitamin c and a. Fruits like oranges, lemon, green leafy vegetables are rich in them. Good sources of Vitamin A are milk, chicken, fish oils, butter, cheese, eggs, and liver. Good sources of Vitamin C are strawberries, oranges, broccoli, and kiwi fruit. One of the most common natural amino acids, L-Arginine is known to boost male fertility and inprove overall sperm quality. Good sources of arginine include dairy products, beef, pork, granola, oatmeal, nuts, and some energy drinks. Lycopene has been shown to increase sperm fertility. Fruits and vegetables that are high in lycopene include tomatoes, watermelon, pink grapefruit, pink guava, papaya, and red bell pepper. Zinc has been shown to increase sperm production and motility. Coupled with amino acids like L-Carnitine and L-Arginine, zinc should increase ejaculate volume significantly. Good sources of zinc include oysters, red meat and poultry. You can also find zinc in beans, nuts, whole grains and dairy products. Wish you good health."},{"Patient":"Hello.

But in your case, it is better to rule out any other cause of infertility in your spose and yourself as a 10 million count of sperm with a normal motily is OK for a fertility and many times even after surgery if fertility is not ensured, it may require IVF. Also, a subclinical varicocele or a grade 1 varicocele is more like to be just incidentally related to low sperms rather than having a cause and effect relationship. The only other indication of surgery is a pain due to which you are mentally and physically suffering in your daily routine and which is not subsiding with scrotal support and occasional analgesics. The recurrence rate after surgery is pretty high as there are so many veins to recur. In short surgrey is not for a case like you.

I understand the concern regarding your problem. You have a feature to upload the reports by yourself at the right side of the query page, please utilize that so that I can answer your queries better. I have gone through your reports. It suggests that you have low sperm count as well as the low sperm motility. Bear in mind that a man's fertility can fluctuate a great deal from week to week. Lots of things affect male fertility. If your fertility is low you should have at least three semen analyses before reaching any conclusions. Do not be too disheartened by a single result. When sperm motility is less, then chances of spontaneous pregnancy decreases. This is one of the common causes of male factor infertility. This is also one of the most common semen abnormalities in men. It could be due to hormonal deficiency, mechanical obstruction to outflow tract, infection and many more. Treatment depends on the cause. Assisted reproductive technology like in vitro fertilization has revolutionized the treatment of infertility. Each year thousands of babies are born in India as a result of ART. Medical advances have enabled many couples to have their own biological child. I suggest you to see the good gynecologist for further treatment options. Eat nutritious food. You can take Vitamin B-complex, Vitamin C, E, and Selenium. These supplements are available in single capsule also. I hope I have answered your query. I will be available if you have any follow up queries. Wish you best of luck.

However, there is no upper age limit at which IVF should not be done. And, in fact, for older women, it might represent their only chance of success. It's not really the age of the woman which is the limiting factor; it's the quality of her eggs.  * Men whose sperm count is very low. Most clinics will consider doing IVF only for men with at least 3 million motile sperm in the ejaculate. If the sperm counts are lower than this, then ICSI (or microinjection) is a better option.  * Women with a damaged uterus (for example, because of healed tuberculosis) because the chance of successful implantation of the embryo in the uterus becomes very poor.

The kind  cyst you have mentioned of the ovary could be cyst due to endometriosis, in which case the cysts have a tendency to recur.It could even be a functional cyst, which is seen generally in a case when, ovulation ie..removal of egg from ovary, does not take place and the follicle continues to grow forming a cyst. This is seen in cases of Polycystic Ovarian Disease.In such case there is a hormonal imbalance too.I would suggest you to get your hormonal levels done after discussing with your gynaec, in case not yet done.And follow the treatment as adviced.Homeopathic treatment, of course might be of some help, as long as the cause is not something which mandates a surgical treatment only.Hence , the best person to commend upon the same would be your gynaec, after it is thoroghly evaluated as to the cause of the cyst.

Even at good hands chances of tubal pregnancy are quite high after treatment. Positives are it is less expensive than IVF for sure, minimally invasive, and it can treat other associated problems if found during operation. If you are lucky you ll get pregnant after laparoscopy. IVF is expensive but it is the treatment of choice in patients with bilateral tubal block. It gives very good success rates.

Anyhow keeping all the possibilities in mind you are young and that blood pressure reading cannot be accepted as a normal for you however this high-normal blood pressure can be managed without medications by trying lifestyle measures first.

However not all women with PCOS suffer from infertility. Such women can take ovulation stimulation treatment which can include diet and lifestyle modification and weight loss as well as medications including clomiphene and metformin treatments. The following recommendations can help you plan Diet for PCOS. Try and lose weight if overweight along with PCOS. In PCOS treatment plan, try to select low glycemic index foods, as they will cause a slower rise in blood sugar. Glycemic index is an indicator of how rapidly the food turns to sugar in the blood. The low glycemic carbohydrates also tend to have more fiber than the high glycemic foods. For example, select breads, grains and cereals that are as unprocessed as possible. Space out the carbohydrates during the day. This will cause less of a rise in blood sugar and insulin as compared to eating all carbohydrates at one meal. Avoid those carbohydrates that trigger more hunger or cravings (e.g. refined flour , sugary foods) Drink at least 8 glasses of non- caffeine fluid per day. For heart’s health, limit foods high in saturated and trans fats namely, fatty red meat, whole milk dairy, butter and stick margarine, chicken skin, fried foods, rich desserts, etc. Select mainly monounsaturated fats (ie. olive oil, canola oil, nuts) and omega 3 fats (fatty fish such as salmon and bluefish, flaxseed, nuts) as these fats are heart healthy. Exercise on a regular basis. If on medication for PCOS, then have fruits and vegetables at least 5 servings a day to increase the immunity of the body."},{"Patient":"after echo test docter asked when i get my heart attack before then i approched hospital where echo and tmt test are done and found positive i am taking medicen ;mrtoprolol,ecosprin-100mg,crestor-10mg,isosorbide-20mg,please advice how to cure my heart is by yoga it can be cure.after taking these medicen my stomak is up set.","Doctor":"Hello!Welcome and thank you for asking on HCM!I passed carefully through your question and would recommend performing a coronary angio CT scan or coronary angiogram in order to examine better the coronary arteries.

For this reason, I recommend performing some tests to investigate for secondary causes of high blood pressure: - a chest X ray study- a resting ECG and cardiac ultrasound- complete blood count- fasting glucose- kidney and liver function tests- blood electrolytes- thyroid hormone levels- cortisol and aldosteron plasma levels.
