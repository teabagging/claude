Here the doctors detected Gall stone (24mm) and recommended for surgery. Then last week I visited CMC, Vellore where I was adviced for surgery. But as the Doctors in CMC are preoccupied they have scheduled the same in April 2011. I am afraid of surgery. Kindly advice and if the surgery is inevitable where can I get it done in a better organized way? With best Regards ; M H Rahaman","Doctor":"Hi,I thoroughly read your query and understood your concerns. Gallstones are small stones that form inside the gallbladder. Gallstones pain (Biliary colic) usually is usually experienced when the gallbladder contracts in response to a fatty meal. This compresses the stones, blocking the opening. As the gallbladder relaxes several hours after the meal, the pain subsides.1. Biliary colic -\\"The pain without cholecystitis- gallbladder infection/inflammation\\" - usually subsides within few hours to a day. Acute cholecystitis secondary to gallstones may be continuous and accompanied with fever. 2. Medical therapy is an option for gallstones , though a vast number of surgeons around the globe prefer removal of gall bladder- surgical intervention. Medical therapy includes intake of ursodeoxyholic acid ( UDCA) for a period of 12 to 24 months. UDCA has been shown to inhibit biliary secretion of cholesterol, reduce intestinal absorption of cholesterol, increase hepatic bile secretion, and improve gallbladder emptying. Medical therapy is useful if mild symptoms, stones are smaller in size ( weight reduction and low-fat diet is also a part of medical therapy.3. Surgery lasts for less than one hour ( usually half an  hour). Laparoscopic surgery has greatly reduced surgery time duration and surgical complications. You may travel 7 to 10 days after surgery, though the surgeon may indicate precise time. I would also like to mention that gall bladder is removed completely in surgical intervention which may impair fat digestion. You maybe asked to cut fat completely from your diet ( or keep to minimum) after gall bladder surgery.Hope to answer your concern. Wish you good and sound health.

During the operation, the doctor clipped the \\"common bile duct\\" instead of the \\"cystic duct\\" causing me to have a major open surgery to repair the duct and reconstruct everything. Ever since that incident, I have had chronic abdominal pain (around the site of the open surgery incision/scar) mostly under the right side of my ribs as well as uncontrollable and unpredictable nausea and vomiting. However, within the last year or two, I have been getting horrible gas. I have disgusting, foul sulfur smelling burps along with a lot of flatulence but the \\"episode\\" would only last a few days and when it would disappear I wouldn't have it again for months. Well, within the last few months, I have had the rotten burps every single day (with maybe 1 day or 2 without symptoms) but it is definitely getting worse. Now, when I get the rotten egg smelling gas and vomit, it feels as though I am vomiting pure alcohol not to mention I have sharp, stabbing pains under the right side of my ribs, I now find myself waking up in the morning with the most awful pain in my back. At first I thought it was the way I slept, but after trying different pillows, different positions, even a different mattress none of that seems to make a difference. The back pain is excruciating!  I can't seem to get any answers from my physician. I would just like to know what could be causing this and if it is treatable. I don't know how much longer I can deal with the back & ribs pain. And the burps are incredibly embarrassing. Please help me! I just need to know what all of these symptoms could mean.","Doctor":"Hi,Clipping the common bile duct during cholecystectomy is one of the most feared complications of this kind of surgery. Can I ask you how your \\"common bile duct\\" was repaired during this open surgery? The best long term solution should have been a hepaticojejunostomy, meaning that a piece of the small bowel is connected to the common bile duct if the bile duct is heavenly damaged.1) If you're suffering from pain since the open operation, then my first suggestion would be to have this checked with an MRCP scan (this is a MRI scan that can check whether the repair of the common bile duct is still ok, meaning no stenosis (= narrowing due scar tissue). For example, after this kind of problem it's important that you're checked regularly (1x/year) to see if everything's allright.2) I should also recommend to have your stools checked. Some people suffer from pain and some kind of diarrhea due to overwhelming bile salts in the stools. It's called bile acid malabsorption. This can be treated with medicines.3) When smelly burps like rotten eggs, one must also think of a kind of bacterial or other infection in the bowels. One well know is for example Giardiasis. This is a disease caused by a parasite which gives most of the time diarrhea, but can also cause bloating, abdominal cramps, and sulfur smelling burps. If not cured by itself you need to take medicines. But other possible problems must be ruled out. So I would recommend to visit a gastroenterologist to have this all checked. Hope this helped.

The combination of light headed and fingers numb is most commonly due to anxiety and hyperventilation. After surgery, you may not need the anxiety because chest wall irritation as you breath sometimes makes you breath shallow and fast. Next time you have these symptoms, count your breaths in a one minute period. Keep a record."},{"Patient":"I am 32 years old, weight 95 kg. height 172 cm.

Your LFT correlate with the fatty liver, and are slightly higher than normal range, (6-47 UI) Liv. 52 DS support the hepatic cells to efficiently burn fats and to treat fatty liver conditions that have arisen due to alcohol consumption or high-fat diet (one of the best options in your case).Udilive -300 (Ursodeoxycholic acid) works by decreasing the production of cholesterol and by dissolving the cholesterol in bile so that it cannot form stones. (your bile is not causing this symptom, the fatty liver). So Udilive will not help with your fatty liver, at least not so effective as Liv 52 DS. At this point, I suggest you keep up with the same medicine that your doctor prescribed , liv-52 DS and you need to make some changes in your diet to help your liver and your body to heal faster.-have plenty of water-eat fresh vegetables and fresh fruits-have a low fat diet-small amount of exercise each day, yoga, walking a few miles-no alcohol at allAlso with this diet, even your intestine will work better, your kidneys, heart, and your whole body.

I've had an Ultrasound, CT scan, blood work, and given a urine sample. The blood and urine showed nothing wrong. The CT and Ultrasound showed a small teardrop size polyp in my gallbladder and no stones. Is this doctor cut happy or should I really be concerned?","Doctor":"Hi,If there is a polyp in gall bladder get it removed by surgery, and endoscopic removal of gall bladder can be done. A polyp can be malignant also. However cancer of gall bladder are very uncommon yet there is a possibility. Hence removal of gall bladder with polyp inside is a better option. Proposed patient risk factors for malignant gallbladder polyps include age greater than 60, presence of gallstones, and primary sclerosing cholangitis. Polyp risk characteristics include a size greater than 6 mm, solitary, and sessile. Please attach detailed reports of CT for further suggestion as all the risk factors have to be accessed.Hope I have answered your query.

I am advised Cholesystectomy..can you help?I am 58 yrs aged female.5 feet 4 inches and 64 kgs of weight.","Doctor":"Hi,As per your symptoms cholecystectomy is treatment of choice in your case. Cholecystectomy is the surgical removal of the gallbladder. It is a common treatment of symptomatic gallstones and other gallbladder conditions. However laproscopic cholecystectomy option is also available. Inflammation of gall bladder is  a indication for cholecystectomy, as you have multiple echogenicities, so you are at risk of pancreatitis also, which is a life threatening condition. Hence, its better to remove gall bladder before any complication does occur.Hope I have answered your query.

It can be mild allergy or can be hives or urticaria with angioedema. Allergic hives and angioedema form, when in response to histamine blood plasma leaks out of small blood vessels in the skin. Histamine is a chemical released from specialized cells along the skin's blood vessels. Allergic reactions, chemicals in certain foods, insect stings, sunlight exposure, or medications can all cause histamine release. It's often impossible to find out exactly why hives have formed.You have to find out the cause by yourself. Antihistaminic medicines like Levocetrizine can be taken along with low doses of Methyl Prednisiolone for 4 to 5 days, allergic test should also be done.Hope I have answered your query.

Therapeutic approaches for the treatment of HCC can be classified into three categories: potentially curative, palliative, and symptomatic. Potentially curative treatments, including liver resection, transplantation, and local ablation, are associated with promising 5-year survival rates of up to 75%. But is not possible when carcionoma is in a very advanced stage. Due to the presence of excessive metastatic disease, the patient is not a candidate for curative surgical resection. Other forms of local therapy, such as percutaneous ethanol injection, cryosurgery, radio frequency ablation, hepatic intra-arterial chemotherapy, or chemoembolization that typically play a role in the palliative treatment of patients with localized, non-resectable disease, are not appropriate in this patient with metastatic disease.

Ultrasound showed only slight fatty changes.Do you think my worsening exhaustion could be partly related to liver?Should I have any further investigations for this before change in meds?

Though liver function tests  are deranged, yet they are not that deranged that they cause fatigue. Fatigue and feeling of exhaustion are because of Fluoxetine which you are having for your ocd.Abnormal liver function tests were most likely because of Mirtazapine. Dont go for any further medication just ask your pychiatrist for few latest ssri's like Paroxetine which are much safer and have significantly less toxic effects.

It would be great if i had more info about his blood results, like liver enzymes, his ultrasound of the liver ect and the reason why he is taking gabapentine and tylenol.

An expert surgeon might do a laparoscopic cholecystectomy without any problem and this procedure lasts around 30 to 40 minutes. The main risks are correlated with her age, her heart disease, kidney and liver function and if she has other chronic problems or not. For example if your mother has only HBP, it is not a problem to do the surgery. But if she has Cardiopulmonary compromise than she has high risks for cardiac complications.It would be great if I had the medical reports of your mother, and medical history to know her risks/complications. If all her organs are working fine, especially her heart, liver and kidneys than she might do the surgery and probably without any serious complications during or after the surgery. Her surgeon and her anesthesiologist will be able to give you more information than me for her risks and complications because they know her medical history, and function of her other organs.Hope I have answered your query.

The surgery that you had in 1995 will not cause any problem at your bellybutton area so the surgeon will be able to use that scar for the gallbladder surgery.

I have reviewed your query and here is my advice. I have read your lab reports and understand your concerns. First I would say to not worry so much. Having these levels of ALT, GGT doesn't always mean a bad or a serious condition. The normal range of values for ALT (SGPT) is from 7 to 56 units depending from the kits that laboratories use and the range for GGT  is 0-45 U/LALT/GGT can be slightly elevated in a lot of healthy patients and here are some of the main reasons:- use of alcohol- fatty liver (since your cholesterol level is 202 it might cause the changes in the liver enzymes)- excessive amount of exercise- stress- use of medication that can damage cells of the liver like ibuprofen, paracetamol, and some types of antibioticsRight now, don't worry too much. Wait to talk with your doctor and if needed he will do other tests. I would recommend an ultrasound of your abdomen to see if you have gallstones and put you on a healthy low fat diet to help your liver heal itself and it's enzymes to get back at normal range. The low fat diet, will help with your cholesterol also. Have plenty of water, don't use alcohol, and have fresh fruits and vegetables. For liver enzymes to get back at normal range, we need to wait usually from 30 to 60 days or even more. Hope I have answered your query.

Usually,liver doesn't have a symptom like pain in most of it's problems. And as you have written, you have slightly liver enzymes which correlate with the presence of the gallstones,the use of Diflocan, or other medications,or even a glass of alcohol. If I was your caring doctor.I would recommend an ultrasound of your abdomen to check for gallstones or any problem of the biliar ducts, and pancreas. Also I would recommend to do liver enzymes,pancreas enzymes at least 1 month to 2 months after the last lab tests that you did to see if the liver enzymes are back to normal or not. If these tests are normal, than probably you need to do a fibrogastroscopy to check your stomach. I would recommend to not take medication like ibuprofen, paracetamol, and to not use alcohol. This way your liver will recover faster. Have plenty of water, eat fresh fruits and vegetables. Exercise will help your liver and your whole body. Have healthy diet, low fat products, fish, olive oil etc. Hope I have answered your query. If you have any other question, feel free to ask me.Regards,Dr. Endri Katro"},{"Patient":"My son is suffering recurring pains due to gall bladder stones(1.5cm diameter,ultasound diagnosis). He detoxifies using freshly extracted juice for almost 2months now. Is there a particular case that MX3 helped an individual with the same problem? Thank you. -Worried Mom.(  YYYY@YYYY  )","Doctor":"Hello and welcome to ‘Ask A Doctor’ service.  I have reviewed your query and here is my advice. MX3 has compounds with antioxidant, anti-bacterial, anti-fungal, and anti-tumor activity. These are found in a lot of studies. Also it has antioxidant effects. It doesn't have effects in dissolving gallstones. And to be honest,other studies needs to be done to determine the the long term effects in humans.For the gallstone problem that your son has I would recommend Ursocol (Ursodeoxycholic Acid). It might help dissolve the gallstones. It works by decreasing the production of cholesterol and by dissolving the cholesterol in bile so that it cannot form stones. But before your son starts this kind of product, he needs to check up with your family doctor first. He needs to do an ultrasound of his abdomen, to see if the walls of the gallbladder are normal, or thicken, liver enzymes etc. Also he use this diet to help his liver to not form stones:-fresh vegetables and fruits-plenty of water-normal exercise-avoid alcohol-diet in low fat like fish, grains, olive oil etcHope I have answered your query.

She is anemic however, cannot lose the 15 or 20 pounds she wants to lose even though she eats VERY little.  She has pretty constant gall bladder pain also.  As a teen she did have gall stones.  I would love to help her find out what's going on with her.","Doctor":"Hello and welcome to ‘Ask A Doctor’ service.  I have reviewed your query and here is my advice. I will try to explain to you everything that your friend needs to be done to find a solution for her symptoms. You mentioned that she had gall stones as a teen. If this is true, then the stones are still there in the gallbladder and maybe that is the reason why she has pain. She needs to do an ultrasound of her abdomen to check for the gallbladder stones. If confirmed,she needs to do some blood tests like liver enzymes, white blood counts,pancreas enzymes, ect to determine if these stones are affecting the liver/pancreas.She needs to do some other blood tests to determine the reason why she is anemic. For example, if she has Iron deficiency anemia which is a common type of anemia — a condition in which blood lacks adequate healthy red blood cells due to insufficient iron. In this case, increasing the intake of iron can cure this problem. Maybe changes in diet, having extra iron with pills etc. She needs to consult a doctor for these case. For her weight problem, well not always lowering the amount of food can help you lose the weight. In this case I would recommend exercise. It will help her with the weight problem and also it will keep her heart and her body in shape. Hope I have answered your query.

Good sources of vitamin D are green leafy vegetables, cod liver oil, fish, fortified cereals, oysters, caviar, tofu, soy milk-Eating organic foods helps regulate the liver, allowing it to cleanse itself of toxins and create new cells to stop the leakage of SGPT into the blood. Green leafy vegetables, broccoli, carrots ect-Avoid foods high in fat like oily foods that are deep fried, meat fats, pork and chicken skins-Avoid foods high in salt or sodium-Have plenty of fresh fruits and vegetables-Have plenty of water-Stop using alcohol-Painkillers like paracetamol,ibuprofen can elevate the levels of SGOT/SGPT-Excessive amount of exerciseHope I have answered your query.

Thank you!","Doctor":"Hello and welcome to ‘Ask A Doctor’ service.  I have reviewed your query and here is my advice. As a liver surgeon, I can tell you that there is no such thing as cleansing your liver by eating or drinking a miracle product . The liver has an enormous regeneration capacity, meaning you can do a lot before it becomes permanently ill. Generally accepted I tell my patients that a female body can tolerate 2 alcoholic drinks (beer) per day. Drinking alcohol doesn't create any pain, at least not in your liver. Alcohol can give you some bowel cramps.If people continue drinking then there might occur problems. For example you can do what we call an alcoholic hepatitis. (mostly heavy drinkers) which can cause some capsular pain of the liver. Liver stetosis can occur if you drink a lot. Meaning the liver becomes fatty. But also pain in the region of the liver can be caused by gall bladder problems like sludge or gall bladder stones.In you want to cleanse your liver, drink enough water, skip a week any alcohol so your liver can recover. Eat healthy food (biological food like carrots, artichoke, and not too much sugar. It will be transformed in fatty cells in your liver. But don't try any crazy diets or products. It might harm the liver more than expected. So enjoy life with or without a social drink. Hope I have answered your query.

There is no role of antibiotic in this. Instead you should take intestinal digestive enzyme supplementation.2) Elevated SGPT level indicate either liver function is weak or liver has too much load to work. Fatty liver is condition in which excessive fat get deposited in liver tissue and affect liver function. This is the reason for elevated SGPT level in your case.3) Fatty liver is due to high level of fat in blood stream secondary to lipid (fat)-rich diet. This might lead to elevated cholesterol level. Thus it is recommended for you to undergo lipid profile test.4) Mild fatty liver is reversible condition. You should do - regular exercise, intermittent fasting (weekly once), high protein diet, low fat-diet, use of omega-3 fatty acid containing oil in food preparation, avoidance of alcohol intake. Your SGPT level can come to normal range with these measure in 15-20 days.Hope I answered your query.

Certain chemicals, ursodiol or chenodiol, which have been shown to dissolve some gallstones, are available in oral bile acid pills. These medicines work by thinning the bile, which allows gallstones to dissolve. Another non-surgical treatment for which gallstones must meet certain criteria is extracorporeal shock-wave lithotripsy (ESWL). It is most effective on solitary gallstones that are less than 2 centimeters in diameter, so fewer than 15 percent of patients are eligible for ESWL. The goal of the treatment is to break up, or fragment, gallstones by sending shock waves through the soft tissue of the body."},{"Patient":"have a bile duct stucture a result of gall blader surgery.

Your low blood pressure has no relation with gall bladder removal. So don't worry about that. Take plenty of fluid with salt.

Also I have white coat syndrome, sometimes pressure rises, been under a great deal of stress, mostly apprehension re: heart tests, etc. Cardiologist says metropolol is good for bp also. I have a monitor, pressure is lower at home, only rises when I maybe active 150/62, pulse in the 70 s and has been as low as 112/60. Still I take readings to the Dr. to let him see that it really is when I am under stress. 50mg made me tired ( Cardio said it would be sluggish), I do feel calmer, had to do 25 twice a day. Still I can fall asleep sitting watching TV and that is not me. I think I could try 25 per day, that is how I started out, but my pressure in theDr. office was 162/63 so he changed it to 50. Now I notice my pressure is higher anywhere from 112 to 175 with the bottom # in the 70 s and my pulse in the 60 s. My Dr. didn t mention the fact that it was compared to at home readings, also because I am calmer in office reading was only 136/62 He thought all the numbers were good, but yet they were higher than before when I took them at home. I don t get it, I thought BP meds reduced your pressure.","Doctor":"With respect to palpitation, that is the sensation not the extra beats. The extra beats may not be harmful or even require treatment. If you have found no underlying heart disease or dangerous rhythm, the primary concern is to relieve your symptoms and anxiety. Finding nothing dangerous does not necessarily mean that heart rhythm is not the source of what you feel but knowing that its not dangerous is often treatment enough. The best way to interpret your blood pressure is to take only recording done on schedule. Single measures should not prompt concern, particularly no those done under stress. Record your blood pressure on a schedule every day. It should be taken seated after a 10-15 min period of relaxation. A two week average is what you use to make decisions about the need to take a medicine and its effect."},{"Patient":"Hello Doctor. i have liver related problem.

Be sure that you are clear with your doctor as to the source of fluid accumulation. A murmur is a sound heard as the heart beats. It may occur as a result of some of the problems that cause fluid accumulation around the heart, as a problem with a heart valve or as a variation of normal. The studies that are done to look at fluid accumulation will also see the heart valves. If no severe problem is uncovered, these are probably not the primary source of your symptoms. For someone like yourself, I will usually screen of systemic problems like the thyroid disorder that someone already found. Discuss what has been done with your doctor and consider additional screening for more widespread inflammatory illnesses."},{"Patient":"Hi there, I have recently been diagnosed with gall stones after having a ultrasound.

Also,there are some protocols to follow before going under surgery,so your doctor is correct for not proposing the to do the surgery.Usually ,depending from the size of the stone,number of the stones (1 vs a lot of stones) ,symptoms ect, patients that have gallstones follow up with their personal doctor each 3 to 6 months and do ultrasound of the abdomen each 6 months or sooner.So i suggest you to not worry right now. You are in a diet,that is a good thing and it might treat your gallstones too. Try to lose the extra weight, but do it gradually. There is a correlation between quick weight loss and gallstone formation. Also try to have a lot of fresh fruits and vegetables-whole grains -lean meat, poultry, and fish-plenty of waterYou can talk with your personal doctor to start ursocol (Ursodeoxycholic Acid) It works by decreasing the production of cholesterol and by dissolving the cholesterol in bile so that it cannot form stones.

She complained about dull radiating pain about a week ago. the pain has subsided now but she has dizziness on and off. doctors advice removal of the gall bladder. I am confused and wondering what to do","Doctor":"hi.thank you for posting query at HCM.i thoroughly read your query and understood your concerns.Gallstones are small stones that form inside the gallbladder.Gallstones pain (Biliary colic) usually is usually experienced when the gallbladder contracts in response to a fatty meal. This compresses the stones, blocking the opening. As the gallbladder relaxes several hours after the meal, the pain subsides.1. Biliary colic -\\"The pain without cholecystitis- gallbladder infection/inflammation\\" - usually subsides within few hours to a day. Acute cholecystitis secondary to gallstones may be continuous and accompanied with fever.2. Medical therapy is an option for gallstones , though a vast number of surgeons around the globe prefer removal of gall bladder- surgical intervention. Medical therapy includes intake of ursodeoxyholic acid ( UDCA) for a period of 12 to 24 months. UDCA has been shown to inhibit biliary secretion of cholesterol, reduce intestinal absorption of cholesterol, increase hepatic bile secretion, and improve gallbladder emptying. Medical therapy is useful if mild symptoms, stones are smaller in size ( weight reduction and low-fat diet is also a part of medical therapy.3. Surgery lasts for less than one hour ( usually half an  hour). Laparoscopic surgery has greatly reduced surgery time duration and surgical complications. You may travel 7 to 10 days after surgery, though the surgeon may indicate precise time.I would also like to mention that gall bladder is removed completely in surgical intervention which may impair fat digestion. You maybe asked to cut fat completely from your diet ( or keep to minimum) after gall bladder surgery.hope to answer your concern.wish you good and sound health.regardsDr Tayyab Malik"},{"Patient":"they found fat in my liver more than a month ago, and istaret a diet but my doctor told me it was not necessary to be on a hard diet due im skinny and i already lost 15 pounds, im taking omeprazole for my acid reflux treatment, i just started taking it 2 days ago and started to have a yeast infection, i had a yeast infection before about 7 months ago id didnt get checked by a doctro because i didnt have insurance then, so itreated qith miconazol and my yeast infection was gone because i never had discomfort until now my questions are if i treated my yeast infection before consulting a doctor caused me to have fat in my liver? and can i treat my yeast infection again with miconazole? can miconazole damage my liver or is it safe?","Doctor":"hi.thank for posting at HCM.1. follow diet as advised by treating physician and re-test liver enzymes n lipid profile and liver ultrasound after 3 to 6 months2. miconazole is an unlikely cause of fatty liver.3. its better to visit a dermatologist or treating physician before taking miconazole.Wish you good and sound health.Regards,Dr Tayyab Malik"},{"Patient":"hi, my husband's age is 35, he recently got his complealt medical and found that his SGPT is 70, he used to smoke till year back and has never taken alcohal or any such drug so what cud be the reasons and precautions for that?Once almost 6-7 years back he faced a liver problem but that was Slow liver functioning due to tension.","Doctor":"Hi welcome to the health care magic Temporary viral infection like infectious mononucleosis,  cytomegalovirus like infection can lead raised sgpt..

You can get alcoholic liver disease from drinking lots of alcohol. It can even show up after a short period of heavy drinking, other causes are obesity and hepatitis B and C.If you have alcoholic liver disease and you are a heavy drinker, quitting is the most important thing you can do.

For the past few months though I m lacking energy and in the past 2 days all I want to do is sleep. I m sleeping all through the night and yet I m up for about half an hour and feel like I can sleep again. The last thing is that I ve been bloated for 3 days now.

My eye isn t shifting anymore but it still feels numb a times.","Doctor":"The palpitation is worth pursuing. An EKG in the office rarely catches the problem. I usually recommend a long term monitor to try and catch the abnormal rhythm and tie it to the symptoms that you feel. There are also tools that allow you to record your rhythm with the telephone. If a monitor finds nothing, you may want to look into one of these apps. If your symptoms only occur every few months, its great to try and catch it with the electronic device that goes every where that you go.If you can catch the rhythm, you can define it, see if its a worry and know how to treat it."},{"Patient":"I have recently recovered from acute pancreatitis, discharged from hospital 5 weeks ago. i can still feel a swollen mass which is concerning me, is this normal and if so how long does it take for things to settle down? could i now have chronic pancreatitis, i am only 22 and it was caused through ERCP","Doctor":"hi. thanks for posting query.going through your history , i advice you to have a CT scan abdomen.sometimes, pancreatic pseudocyst - a complication of pancreatitis is observed few weeks after an attack of acute pancreatitis.however, most pseudocyst are of NO harm and regress itself. wish you good and sound healthregardsDr Tayyab Malik"},{"Patient":"my wife had 2 gall stones and her gall bladder removed 2months ago, since then she has experianced diarrah constantly and also has been bleeding like on a period, some times light and other times quite heavy, is there a cause for concern and should we see a doctor.???","Doctor":"hi.thanks for posting query at HCM.The cause of diarrhea after gallbladder removal is not certain.

Thank you for your query.

Or if by chance the laboratory where you did the blood analyse has the range for sgot (5-40) than your slightly elevated levels can be due to these reasons:-alcohol-excessive exercise -fatty liver-medications like ibuprofen,Tylenol (paracetamol) ect-your kidney disease might also rise the levels of sgot.If i was your caring doctor i would tell you to not worry.

Kind Regards  Pooja Dutta","Doctor":"hi and pleased toanswer youCholecystectomy is the standard and definitive treatment for symptomatic gallbladder stones and can be performed regardless of the type, number, and size of the stones.If your gallstones are small and don't contain calcium, it may be possible to take ursodeoxycholic acid tablets to dissolve them. Effects of ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) or Oral litholysis induces cholesterol desaturation of bile and may lead to gallstone dissolution in patients with small, radiolucent, cholesterol-enriched stones in a functioning gallbladder with a patent cystic duct. Based on a simple correlation with the gallstone dissolution rate, small size, radiolucency of gallstone, and preserved gallbladder function have been listed as indication criteria for UDCA therapy. Size rather than number of stones is the primary determinant of the dissolution rate.Gallstones smaller than 5 mm show a better dissolution rate than those exceeding 5 mm. Stones of less than 5 mm diameter can be dissolved in almost 79% of cases, whereas the success rates drop to roughly one-third with stones larger than 10 mm in diameter. With stones, more than 15–20 mm diameter, the dissolution time is extremely long.

Please type your query here...Hi,I am a 41 year old normally healthy female who recently had a baby 6 weeks ago. My ALT levels are normally fine but I was concerned so my MD ordered a liver enzyme test. The number was 64 U/l which according to palo alto medical foundation us WNL. Other labs report this value as high.During my pregnancy I was put on low levels (50-100 mg ) of labetalol, and after my c section was put on percocet and then vicodin. I also continued the Labetalol. This was my second C section. Post Op I had some cellulitis  and problems with my incision thus the reason they contiued me on vicodin. I no longer need the pain meds and do not take anything now for pain. I also am nursing. I do not drink anything alcoholic, do not smoke and am gradually losing the pregnancy weight (I gained 30 pounds).My QUESTION: Is the value of the ALT test alarming and should I question PAMF's upper limit of normal value? Again, my number for the ALT is 64 and 29 or 30 I believe for the AST.Thanks","Doctor":"Hi and welcome to Healthcaremagic. Thank you for your query. I am Dr. Rommstein, I understand your concerns and I will try to help you as much as I can.I don’t think this is related to your pregnancy. AST (SGOT) and ALT (SGPT) are reasonably sensitive indicators of liver damage or injury from different types of diseases or conditions, and collectively they are termed liver tests or liver blood tests. So the next step is to look for certain liver damage and most common casue is fatty liver disease. It should be confirmed by ultrasound. Other causes are viral hepatitis,cirrhosis, medications, alcohol intake or autoimmune diseases.

So my question is are the enzymes levels raised due to my excersice habbits? because i cant find any other reason why. i dont drink, take drugs- prescription or illigal, its apart of my athletic values. thanks for the help","Doctor":"Hello,What you are doing is fine. Strenuous exercise can lead to a mild increase in aspartate aminotransferase (AST) levels, but not much effect on alanine transaminase (ALT). You have not mentioned your full liver function test (LFT) report. I would suggest you meet your physician, and if enzymes are abnormal, he would suggest you get some other tests for liver like Hepatitis B and C. So rather than worrying please discuss with your physician. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further.Regards,Dr. Laxmikant Desai"},{"Patient":"Hi, it was discovered I had hematuria at my routine gyn exam, and mild hypertension. Referred to my family dr who repeated and found microscopic and dipstix +. No gross hematuria noted. Sonogram showed bilateral cortical thinning of kidneys. Did cmp, sed rate, cbc, 24 hr urine for Protein and creatinine....all perfectly within normal limits, What is the renal cortical thinning from? Dr said it might be congenital? but wants to send me to urologist for cysto, but during this time, I was also diagnosed with breast ca and she wants me to have breast sx first? What do you think ?","Doctor":"In the search for blood in the urine, the first goal is to find its source, the kidney or the tubes that drain it. There are inherited reasons for the kidney to allow red blood cells out but the more common source is in the drainage system. That is why your doctor is calling for a urologist. The ultrasound shouldn't be considered in isolation. It is impossible to know what it means until all other evidence is in. It is just one part of that evidence. Your doctor seems to have placed concerns about your breast first and this seems appropriate. Cancer caught early may be curable. An accurate diagnosis is crucial. I would follow the advice that you've been given."},{"Patient":"My mother has gallstone, she's 37 years old and she's been doing well. The doctor put her on a diet, no fried food, or fatty foods. This includes no oil, but unfortunately someone gave her oil, now she's in pain and she says it feels like she's getting stabbed in the stomach. We would go to the hospital but her doctor is out of town and he's the only one who has her medical records, if we go to the hospital we might be running a heavy risk at the doctors not having any idea what to do with her due to lack of information. We've given her some lemons in water to break up the oil. She cannot take her pain killers for another three hours. But is there something else that we can do?","Doctor":"Hello and thank you for asking HCM.I have read the symptoms of your mother and i understand your concerns.It seems she has a a biliary colic, or worse even pancreatitis. No one can be sure for the diagnosis without tests.Usually the pain disappears in a few hours,but if the pain is prolonged and she has other symptoms like nausea,vomiting, fever than probably she has cholecystitis (infection of the gallbladder) In this case she need to check up at the hospital to do some tests.-ultrasound of her abdomen (to check the walls of the gallbladder,biliary ducts,pancreas ect)-blood tests (to check the white blood cells for presence of infection,liver enzymes,pancreas enzymes)-a consult with a surgeon.It doesn't matter that her personal doctor is out of tows. The other doctors will do the tests and will know what to do once they have a diagnosis.If you have any other question,feel free to ask me.Dr.Endri Katro"},{"Patient":"I am 23 years old female. Few years ago, I accidentally descovered that I have a 9mm gallstone. Sometimes, when I am nervous or concern, I fell strong pain in the upper abdomen that increases rapidly.  When in pain, I drink linseed tea and the pain goes away in 30 min max.Doctors told me that I can live with it and didn't mention any other treatment than surgery. My diet is really healthy, and I have normal weight. Just to mention that my both grandmothers and my uncle (the brother of my father) had gallstones.I do regular checks- everything is normal and the stone does not increase.I want to keep my gallbladder since I don't fell pain often, actually it is very rare, max 10-15 times in few years. The problem is that I was told that the pregnancy with gallstones is hazard. I am not planing to get pregnant in near future,but I want to solve the problem with the stone, so I can have safe pregnancy in a few years from now.Can you please tell me your opinion about my problem.Thank you for your time and concern.Sincerely, Anita","Doctor":"Hello and thank you for asking HCM.I have read your report,and i understand your concerns.In most of the times,surgery is the only way of dealing with gallbladder stones. And yes,a pregnancy with a gallstone is hazard and might cause a lot of problems for the health of the mother (pancreatitis, infection of the gallbladder ect)Since you don't have serious symptoms (strong pain,vomiting,nausea, fever) and you don't want the surgery,there is another way of trying to get rid of the stone.Udiliv 300 (Ursodeoxycholic acid) is an oral prescription medicine used in the treatment of gallstones.It is also useful in preventing gall stone formation.It should be taken under medical supervision in terms of dosage and duration of intake after due consultation with a doctor.This product is safe to take if you are pregnant or planning to get pregnant.Also here are some advice to help your liver and body to not form any other stones:-don't use excessive amount of alcohol-avoid concentrated fats like oil, butter, margarine, fat on meat ect-vegetables, potato ,fresh fruits, rice,pasta ect-have  plenty of waterI suggest you check up with your physician or your gastroenterologyst for the prescripion of Ursobil. Your doctor will give the wright dose and the time that you need to take it.If you have any other question,feel free to contact me.Dr.Endri Katro"},{"Patient":"I exercised vigorously, drank a lot of water, and then went in for a blood test.  THe results show my ALT at 33 and AST at 49.  I go for a Hepatic Function Panel next month to look into this further.  Can exercise increase AST levels?  I am also a two times 10 year survivor of Hodgkins Lymphoma and received both radiation and Chemo.  My thyroid function tests were normal.  Thanks for your response","Doctor":"Hello and thank you for asking HCM.I have read your reports and i understand your concerns.First of all I want to say to not worry too much about the slightly elevated level of AST at 49. Its normal range is 10–40 U/L (depending from the laboratory it might vary the normal range a bit) There are a lot of reasons why a healthy patient has slightly elevated levels of AST and yes, exercise can increase the levels of AST. Here are some of the most common reason why a healthy patient has elevated AST:-medicines, such as statins, antibiotics,aspirin ect-alcohol (even 1 glass of wine a night before,can increase the levels)-exerciseYou do not need to worry at the moment,probably after 1 month when you will redo the tests,it will be normal. Usually for AST to get back at normal we need around 30 days to 90 days. So even if after 1  month,it still is slightly elevated, doesn't always mean that you have a serious problem with your liver.If you have any other question,feel free to ask me.Dr.Endri Katro"},{"Patient":"Hi, may I answer your health queries right now ?  Please type your query here... Got my LFT results.My GGT level is 157 ALT is 75..rest evrything normal.History of excesssive alcohol consumption in last 3 months.I am absolutely refraining from alcohol now.Could you please tell me how long would it take for these 2 markers to be normal again.?","Doctor":"Hello and thank you for asking HCM.I have read your report and my answers are as follows:Your liver enzymes correlates with the excessive amount of alcohol that you have used. (as you have mentioned above)GGT is a   liver specific enzyme that indicates the state of alcoholic liver disease . Drinking raises GGT, so an elevated GGT in active drinkers will not accurately indicate disease. With abstinence, GGT should fall quickly back to normal range, typically within 30-90 days depending from the amount of alcohol used,our diet,our health ect.Same time needs ALT to normalize. So to be sure that your enzymes are back to normal,and your liver has no problems,these enzymes need to be checked again after 90 days. If even after this amount of time,the enzymes are high than farther tests need to be done.During this time,you need to follow a no alcohol diet.Also:-low fat diet-fresh fruit and vegetables-eat fish-Grains-Nuts-Olive oil-Try as much as you can to not use medications like paracetamol (tylenol)Bear in mind that excessive amount of exercises or even stress can cause elevated levels of AST/ALT (not GGT) so you need not to worry to much for the levels that you actually have.If you have any other question,feel free to ask me.Dr.Endri Katro"},{"Patient":"I am in need of a gallbladder removal, but the dates I have been given were all after i'm having a full hysterectomy and a resection of the bowel.  Is it unsafe to do a laparascopic gallbladder procedure and then to have the other, longer procedures immediately afterwards on the same day?","Doctor":"Hello and thank you for asking HCM.I have read your reports and i understand your concerns.For my opinion,there is no problem doing all the 3 procedures at the same moment. Depending from the reason why you are doing the hysterectomy and resection of the bowel,doctors will decide with which organ to start first. Laparoscopic gallbladder removal takes around 30min to 45 minutes,depending from the skills of the surgeon,and if there is any inflammation of the walls of the gallbladder,or around it(probably you have stones in your gallbladder since you need to remove it).Than the surgeon might continue with the removal of uterus,and the resection of the bowel,or vice versa. So from the technical point,there are no problems to do all 3 surgeries at the same moment. Medically,i can't be sure since i don't have your medical reports,and I am not your personal surgeon. But you need to consult your surgeon that will do the bowel resection and ask him to do the gallbladder removal.If you have any other question,feel free to ask me.Wish you good health.Dr.Endri Katro"},{"Patient":"My 63 year old husband has just had a blood test result showing ALT level of 47.

Should we be concerned?","Doctor":"Hello and thank you for asking HCM.I have read the report of your husband,and I understand your concerns.First i want to say to not worry about the ALT level of 47.There are a lot of reasons why a healthy patient,has elevated ALT.-very strenuous exercise or severe injury to a muscle (your husband walks a lot,exercise)-medicines, such as statins, antibiotics, aspirin, acetaminophen (paracetamol)-alcohol (your husband has 1 or 2 glasses of wine per week)-fatty liver ectIf i was your doctor,i would  recommend to have a low fat diet, fresh fruit and vegetables, plenty of water and change the white wine with the red one,because of its ability to protect the heart.

She's been taking udiliv300 now and the doctors have asked her to keep taking it for ten days or so and then maybe they'll go with laparoscopy. The largest size of the stone is 8mm. Will the medicine help? or will we have to go with the whole removal of the gall bladder?","Doctor":"Hello,Udiliv 300 works by reducing the cholesterol production and dissolving cholesterol so it can not form any stones in the gallbladder. These tablets are very effective in dissolving gall stones especially the cholesterol gallstones. Usually, it needs two or three months to dissolve the gallstones.If your mother doesn't have any symptoms like pain in her right quadrant area, nausea, or vomiting due to the pain, fever, or elevated liver enzymes, or if the walls of the gallbladder aren't thickened (in few words, infection of the gallbladder). I suggest that your mother waits two or three months before doing the surgery (10-15 days won't dissolve the stones). After this time, she will need to do another ultrasound to check the walls of the gallbladder, the size of the stones, liver enzymes, etcetera.Meanwhile, she needs to have these changes in her diet, to prevent an infection of her gallbladder or symptoms like pain.-A low-fat diet (vegetables, potato, pasta and rice with oil-free sauces, grilled or steamed fish)-Plenty of water-Avoid alcohol-Avoid concentrated fats like oil, butter, margarine, fat on meat or avocadoHope I have answered your query.

In these numbers no reason to be worried much.Here are some reasons why you might have AST/ALT in those numbers:-use of pain medications, particularly acetaminophen (Tylenol)-Certain prescription medications,used to control cholesterol-Stress-Obesity-steatosis or steatohepatitisIf i was your doctor, i would tell you to not to worry right now. You need to do again the blood tests after 1 month probably and try not to take any alcohol,or painkillers. An ultrasound of your abdomen,would help to check if your have a fat liver,or stones in your gallbladder and the elevated enzymes would correlate with these conditiones too.Observation with lifestyle modification may be undertaken for up to six months.

Symptoms don't help much here,since both types of polyps have poor symptoms. Any gallbladder polyp that is felt to be symptomatic should be removed.A lot of studies have been done to determine the factors when a laparoscopic cholecystectomy should be done. The cholecystectomy should only be undertaken in cases where there are clinical signs of gallbladder polyps (symptoms like pain ect), polyps with diameters greater than 10 mm, fast-growing polyps.Polyps under 10 mm should be followed-up with serial ultrasound examinations each 6 month. My opinion,in your case,if you don't have any symptoms is to wait before doing the surgical procedure. Each 6 months you need to do ultrasound of your gallbladder/EUS or MRI.

No problems at all in this test.-According to your drinking,it depends on the amount of alcohol that you have these 2 times each week and the type of alcohol. Having 1 glass of red wine 2 or 3 times a week,protects your heart. The alcohol and certain substances in red wine called antioxidants may help prevent coronary artery disease, the condition that leads to heart attacks. I would disagree for the other types of alcohol.If i was your caring doctor,i would suggest to not drink 2 times each week and have this diet in order to help your liver clean itself from the accumulated fat.

And since you have a stone treating it with antibiotics probably will not work. And since you are having pain always,it means that surgery is the only option left. If i was your caring doctor ,i would do some blood tests first to check the liver enzymes (AST,ALT,GGT,SGOT,SGPT  ect), levels of bilirubin and the pancreatic enzymes.

The liver can be damaged by an infection,but it need to be spread all over the body, (we call it sepsis) and the patient would be in serious conditions and have a lot of other symptoms,like low blood pressure, high fever,polipnea ect,this is not in your case.In your case, the red band in the right side of your stomach that is hot to touch, is probably skin rash that is caused by the varicella zoster virus or cellulitis or some other skin infection. Starting antiviral medicine right away can help your rash heal faster and be less painful and you can use ibuprofen for the pain (for varicella zoster,or antibiotics for cellulitis ex). I suggest you check up with your family doctor to see the red band that you describe,and if its from varicella zoster/cellulitis,he will give you the prescription with antivirals/antibiotics and some pain reviler.

The amount of tolerance to alcohol varies individually depending on the enzyme and metabolization rate. Drinking 3 pegs per day for 3 years might injure or liver might get cirrhosed in which case metabolization slows down and the amount of alcohol cleared from the body may be slowed.So, I would strictly recommend you to quit alcohol before its too late."},{"Patient":"My wife (55) is suffering from cirrhosis of liver.

Once cirrhosis has developed there is no treatment that can reverse it but it is very essential to find the cause of cirrhosis, which when treated accordingly can prevent further progression.

I was first diagnosed with lone atrial fibrillation in 1996 and prescribed a dosage of Flecainide Acetate at 50 mg twice daily. My episodes of Atrial Fibrillation were extremely rare and usually short in duration. The Flecainide did not prevent them entirely. Recently I changed my GP who examined both me and my complete medical history. He was extremely surprised that I had been continuously prescribed the medication without review and advised me to stop taking the medication immediately as he did not feel my condition justified continued use. This was one moth ago and I have suffered no symptoms. I am also very health conscious and eat a very healthy vegetarian diet. I am non smoking and do not drink alchohol (apart from a glass of wine with some meals). I run between 30 - 40 miles a week (have done since my teenage years) and also brisk walk with my wife several times a week. What do you advise about stopping taking the Flecainide Acetate?","Doctor":"Lone atrial fibrillation has two concerns, symptoms and the risk of stroke. You report no risk factors for stroke but this is an important part of the conversation with your doctor on a yearly basis. Limiting symptoms often requires nothing. Atrial fibrillation will not go away. It will reoccur, usually in brief episodes. Episodes may occur once or twice a year at first. Over time, episodes will get longer and come more frequently. As they do, medicine is used to abort or prevent them. For someone like you in whom they remain rare, keeping medicine with you in case symptoms occur is the current preference. It is called pill in the pocket. Flecainide is actually the preferred drug. The dose is different for pill in the pocket as opposed to daily dosing. The original recommendation was not a bad one. Flecainide has no cumulative harm and is effective. You may want to revisit the issue with the prescribing doctor and ask about pill in the pocket."},{"Patient":"I recently had labs drawn for work.

And this also develop jaundice5) In such cases, biopsy of liver is mandatory to find out exact cause but upper GI endoscopy is also essential as portal hypertension cause enlargement of veins at lower part of esophagus (which might cause blood containing vomiting if rupture)."},{"Patient":"In 2003 ,during blood it is understood that my liver enzymes were elevated and my sgpt & sgot levels in 2003 is 128 and 48 and sugar level is 80.last blood test on 2011 may,results shows that my sgpt is 64,sgot is 26,alk pho is 237 u/l,fasting blood sugar is 130,triglyceride is 186,TLC 8600 and DLC (Polymorph 57%,Lympho 38%,Eosinophils 5% and ESR 3mm/Ist Hr).all other test shows normal.Same like that in my ultrasound scan results  shows the following2007 - Liver shows mild enlargement with fatty changes and max span 15.6 cms.span of spleen is 11.3 cms.all other organs shows normal 2008 – Liver shows enlargement with fatty changes and max span is 14.6 cms.span of spleen is 10.5.all other organs normal2009 - Liver shows mild enlargement with fatty changes and regenerating nodules are also seen. max span 15cms.span of spleen is 9.6 cms.all other organs shows normal But my last scan in may 2011 shows the following conclusionThere is further increase in the span of liver from 15 cms to 16.5 cms.no evidence of splenomegaly,ascites or portal hypertension.Diffuse fatty changes are present with regenerating nodules.spleen shows smooth and normal size,max span of spleen is 9 cms.

This lead to deposition of residual fat on liver tissue and also affect liver function2) Fat containing diet, sedentary lifestyle, alcohol are aggravating factors for it.3) Fatty liver is divided into three categories; mild, moderate and severe based on severity of fat deposition on liver. You might have moderate level fatty change based on long duration history + size of liver4) But presence of regenerating nodule warrant me to progression into severe category. In extreme case, it develop cirrhosis (rare) which is irreversible condition.5) Therefore you need further evaluation (MRI abdomen or contrast enhanced CT scan abdomen, upper GI abdomen) for precise categorisation of your disease and to start prompt treatment for it."},{"Patient":"My wife has end stage liver disease and is on regular doses of lactulose and xfaximin.

It also increase chances of bleeding during surgery, decrease healing, wound infection.3) Surgery has very limited role in case of spread of tumor to liver from somewhere else.4) It is advisable to consult medical oncologist to discuss further treatment (chemotherapy or surgery).

If value of this test is elevated then USG abdomen or contrast enhanced CT scan abdomen is recommended to evaluate extent of pancreatitis.6) Sometimes repeated episodes of acute pancreatitis can lead to structural changes into pancreatic tissue (fibrosis) and pancreatic duct (narrowing and stone formation) and this condition is known as chronic pancreatitis.

The change to generic is a very unlikely source for vomiting. Blood pressure recording should be done routinely and not sporadically. Single measures should not prompt concern.

Medical therapy is an option for gallstones , though a vast number of surgeons around the globe prefer removal of gall bladder- surgical intervention. Medical therapy includes intake of ursodeoxyholic acid ( UDCA) for a period of 12 to 24 months. UDCA has been shown to inhibit biliary secretion of cholesterol, reduce intestinal absorption of cholesterol, increase hepatic bile secretion, and improve gallbladder emptying. Medical therapy is useful if mild symptoms, stones are smaller in size ( weight reduction and low-fat diet is also a part of medical therapy.2. Surgery lasts for less than one hour ( usually half an  hour). Laparoscopic surgery has greatly reduced surgery time duration and surgical complications.

I am Dr. Rommstein, I understand your concerns and I will try to help you as much as I can.There are two main types of fatty liver disease: Alcoholic liver disease and Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. You can get alcoholic liver disease from drinking lots of alcohol. It can even show up after a short period of heavy drinking, other causes are obesity and hepatitis B and C.If you have alcoholic liver disease and you are a heavy drinker, quitting is the most important thing you can do.  If you don't stop you could get complications like alcoholic hepatitis or cirrhosis. Even if you have nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, it can help to avoid drinking. If you are overweight or obese, do what you can to gradually lose weight -- no more than 1 or 2 pounds a week.Eat a balanced and healthy diet and get regular exercise. Limit high-carb foods such as bread, grits, rice, potatoes, and corn. And cut down on drinks with lots of sugar like sports drinks and juice.I hope I have answered you query.

Such medications can help control the shakiness, anxiety, and confusion associated with alcohol withdrawal and reduce the risk of withdrawal seizures and delirium tremens. Once the symptoms are controlled then he needs to undergo treatment by other drugs such as Naltrexone or Disulfiram to reduce the craving for alcohol.Hope the suggestions given above would be beneficial to him in getting rid off alcohol.Best wishes."},{"Patient":"am i speaking to a real person?I had walnuts the other night along with 3 ibuprophen (we painted all day)...and 2 double jack and cokes....30 minutes later i was in the er. and being told it could be pancreatitis lipase levels of 646 my family dr. says maybe acid reflux or gall baldder","Doctor":"Hi & Welcome to HCM.I can understand your concern.Incomplete data like serum amylase? any ultrasound scan done? and other liver function tests???It's suggestive of acute pancreatitis.A normal lipase level is 0-160 U/L.If the pancreas is damaged, these digestive enzymes can be found in the blood at higher levels than normal.

However, it can also occur in non alcoholics as well. It develops when the body creates too much fat or cannot metabolize fat fast enough. The excess fat is stored in liver cells where it accumulates to form fatty liver disease. Eating a high-fat diet may not directly result in fatty liver.There isn’t a medication or surgery to treat fatty liver. You need to have certain lifestyle changes like:1. The first line of treatment is usually weight loss through a combination of a healthy diet and exercise. Losing weight addresses the conditions that contribute to nonalcoholic fatty liver disease.

The liver demonstrates heterogeneous enhancement with somewhat irregular lacy areas of enhancement scattered throughout the liver and the noduals may indicate some areas of regeneration (which that part is good). There is one area in the right lobe of the liver lateralally which demonstrates a wedge shaped area of greater enhancement but not have the appearance of a mass. The spleen is also enlarged and a ct/pets scan should be reformed for further evaluation. Over all impression is evidence for hepatosplenomegaly.

(Process is similar to healing of any deep wound on skin which would not be same skin)3) Because of damage to liver tissue and decreased ability to reproduce new liver cells, liver function gets deteriorated gradually (Once liver damage, this deterioration is irreversible)4) Because of these changes, not only liver function is affected but vessels which supply blood to liver (Portal vein) are also affected and develop high pressure within this vein which causes portal hypertension (causes enlargement of spleen). In severe cases portal hypertension may cause blood vomiting. To prevent this periodic upper GI endoscopy is necessary.5) To evaluate condition periodically, USG abdomen for status of liver is mandatory6) To support liver function, you may require medical gastroenterologist consultation and supportive treatment over long period of time with abstinence from alcohol"},{"Patient":"My 14 year old son has been diagnosed with jaundice.

Two weeks later I was feeling fatigued, a little dizzy and having a intermittent difficulty breathing.  I went to my GP and she said there was uninfected fluid in my ears and that it was most likely causing my feelings of vertigo.  A week later, after having eaten a large meal, I went to the Emergency room because I feel abdominal pain and a feeling of something pushing out of my stomach which the ER doctors thought might have been appendicitis.  I was kept over night and then checked out in the morning not feeling 100% but no more abdominal pain.  A couple weeks later and the fatigue was practically unbearable, I would have gotten up in the morning and three hours later needed to lie down after having done practically nothing.  I went to the ER and they did a physical examination of my abdomen, chest and did a chest Xray, everything including bloodwork checked out.  Now my GP thinks I may have a case of asthma and some random virus for the other symptoms.  Currently I have a sore throat, I need to clear my throat frequently and intermittent abdominal and chest pain (which I think is my esophagus).

That's not to say that you shouldn't address the things that cause high blood pressure, just that medicine may not be needed.To get a real idea, get your own cuff.

That trumps what the nurse gets in the office.Look to your diet. Limit sodium intake to Exercise should be anything that is maintained for longer than 20 minutes.

I couldnt work or anything and havnt since, after 1 month i got a bad cold and started having 3 a day. After my cold stopped i continued having alot so i went to another doctor which told me to take blood tests and take this xanex 3 times a day at.25mg then i went back to another doctor and he said the other doctor was wrong i took more blood tests and had .5mg xanex for a month. Thats when i really had troubles breathing through out the day and so i went to see a chyropractor/kinsiologist and he told me that i would be fine its just i had too much acidity in my body so i should eat right. Soon after i went back to my doctor who perscribed me .5mg xanex and told him i wanted off , then he told me after 3 months its weird that your heart is still going fast , i thought it was cause u took too much redbull but now u need to go see a cardioligist (heart doctor) and strap a machine on u for 24 hours to see ur heart . he lowered my xanex to .25mg and said in two weeks to go lower and then off , he also told me to take more blood tests. My heartbeat stays at about 100bpm sometimes its 80 bpm and somtimes 120 bpm , he told me if it goes over 140bpm i should go to the Emergency room, but since the last 6 days it hasnt gone over 120 that i know of. Can someone just please help me its been 3 months i havnt worked and i feel like sh*t. i went to go see a cardiologist but they said i have to wait till march 2012 ....... What am i suppose to do.

It is less if you exercise and more if you don’t. Your heart rate variation may be anxiety related. If so, I agree that xanax is a poor long-term treatment option. You should try to wean from it if possible. The monitor is a good idea. I will usually ask for long-term (3-7days) monitoring to judge. It is good to keep of diary of symptoms with heart rate along with blood pressure.

A year prior to that I was in normal range and had the Mirena. I had the Mirena removed a year ago and started taking birth control pills. I began having numbness in my two little toes on my right foot and they also feel cold about a month ago. The numbness comes and goes but it happens every day now. After talking with my gyno Dr. we decided to switch from Yaz to progestin only pills to see if it would help with my triglyceride levels. My primary Dr. also has me on Fenofibrate. I am really concerned about the numbness and what could be causing it. I have also lost about 30 lbs. within the last 5 months and am working on 25-30 more.  My thyroid levels checked out fine and was negative for diabetes when she last tested me. Any feedback would be greatly appreciated. Thanks!","Doctor":"Two questions.The toes. Almost certainly unrelated to your triglycerides though you rightly raise concern about your weight and glucose. Since its just one foot, it probably isn't a systemic problem. If your doctor has no concerns about your back, a visit with a podiatrist may be the best next step.Triglyceride. It may be inherited, due to diabetes or systemic illness and rarely a drug. Of course the most offending drug is alcohol. It sounds as though your weight is excessive and your are successful in reducing it. That is by far the most important cause and treatment. Medicine isn't necessary unless your values are very high (>500) after your efforts with diet and weight. Be sure to limit carbohydrate intake as much as possible and strictly avoid refined sugars and see if you can talk your doctor out of medicine in three months."},{"Patient":"Hi Dr, for the past 5 months I battled with terrible \\"liver\\" pain.

First of all , it is not that unusual that patients suffer again even after cholecystectomy and ERCP. It's called post-cholecystectomy syndrome. This means  some patients still feel pain like with gall stones due to the fact that the main bile duct might slightly dilatete and becomes a kind of reservoir so that the bile will stay longer. in the bile duct, becomes thicker and causes pain.So things to do.1) stay with a low fat diet. The less fat you eat, the less bile you normally will produce in the liver, the lesser chance to get thicker bile and sludge.2) when an ERCP is done , a papillotomy should have been performed. This is a cut in muscle of the sphincter of the bile duct so it will stay open to prevent that bile might accumulate in the bile duct and causes Problems.3) Sometimes it might be useful to give medicine like Ursofalk (= Ursodeoxychol acid). This can make the bile more liquid If the pain continues I suggest you contact your gastroenterologist again.Hope I could help you."},{"Patient":"An ultrasound done to check my gallbladder came back with \\"heterogeneous liver\\".

These masses may be benign genetic differences or a result of liver disease. In most cases, a finding of heterogeneous liver is followed by further medical testing to determine the cause of the heterogeneity.So most of the time heterogeneous liver on ultrasound can be the sign of a fatty liver for example.When the rest of your exams are ok , it's highly unlikely that a tumor or liver cirrhosis are present.In case of fatty liver which is reversible one can avoid fatty meals.For me it would not be a reason to deny a insurance.Hope this helps"},{"Patient":"Hello Doctor, three week back i has sudden upper abdomen pain and i was rushed to hospital, I was given painkiller injection and som gas medicine.

I am having a bit of pain when i move and breath in deeply, and also when coughing.","Doctor":"Hallo,First of all , laparoscopic cholecystectomy is one of the most performed surgeries by abdominal surgeons. In most cases there is no need to place a drain.Sometimes when a operation was more \\"bleeding\\" then expected it can be useful to put a drain to have remaining fluid removed postop out of your belly. That's better to have it out than it would stay in off course.So it's difficult to see if a drain was necessary for your operation, that's most of the time a peroperative decision by the surgeon.  The pain after removing the drain must go away pretty quick. Sometimes patients might suffer for 1-2 days after removing and a simple pain killer can relief the pain. It depends also on which type of drain was used (with or without suction for example). If the pain continues or even gets worse, then I perform a control ultrasound and blood exam to check whether everything is fine. There might be a small collection of fluid for example that might irritate the diaphragm which causes pain, coughing etc...But I would wait another day, and if the pain gets worse, it's time to contact your surgeon again.Hope you get well and take care."},{"Patient":"I am a 62 year old woman, 120 lbs., 5' 5\\" tall.

If it's a fatty diarrhea , one must think of  Bile acid malabsorption, known also as bile acid diarrhea.The you should try Questran (= colestyramine) 2x/day. I guess that in USA this medicine is called diferently than in Belgium.But you should contact the people of MD Anderson, they are one of the best and ask if the bile acid diarrhea might be the problem.Hope this helped."},{"Patient":"Hi my name is Gilbert and i m 29 years old 174cmand 70 kgs i m an atheltic guy4 times per week i go to the gym evreything was normal until i had a weakness in my body and i did blood test and my doctor said that i have gilbert syndrome like my name :).he prescripted to me to take vitamin pills called simepar(contains silymarine,VIT B1,B2,B6,B12..)and from a month until now i m having a very healthy diet foods and a lot of fruits and vegetables but the symptoms is not over yet i cannot drive my car or go to my work ..my question is how many days can be last this syndrome?","Doctor":"The Gilbert syndrome is innocent. It's the lack of a specific enzyme in your liver which causes some liver tests to increase.People don't suffer, the only thing you must see is yellow sclera (yellow eyes in stead of the normal white) especially after some alcohol. Or some medications can cause this. But you should not worry, millions of people have this.So just enjoy life and keep up your healthy life."},{"Patient":"hi, my friend is having 13mm stone in galbladder he doesnot want to undergo treatment what are  the symptoms to know the emergency age :- 51 male height 6 ft wt :- 72having this problem for 5 yrs .

I had a lapband surgery, and now after a blood test, my DR. sent me in to a Gastroligist. I am getting a Ultrasound next week, since I got the news, I have been eating raw vegetables, and exercising regularly. I am so scared. I am not lazy, and I will do anything to try and reverse it. Is Nash reversible also?","Doctor":"Well NASH might be reversible. So if you have overweight , then there is a risk of developing NASH. So the cure is to lose weight.There are even studies which suggest that weight loss surgery will benefit the \\"cure\\" of NASH.So losing weight can help reverse it and make your liver back normal;hope this helped."},{"Patient":"Hi my name is Ernie, im 27 year old male. Been dealing with alot of issues for six months consisting of heart palps , irregular rythem, dizzy/lightheadness not vertigo, change in bowels. My doc says its all anxeity related. Recently I found out I have vericocele no pain though. My blood work shows total Testosterone at 392 and B12 at 315. My doc put me on 2000mcg of B12 for a month but after 2 weeks i noticed i get pain in left arm and tingly fingers in left hand so i stopped taking the B12 pill and it went away, does this show B12 causing me a blood clot? Tommorow morning i go get my total t tested again and the free t also b12 tested again to see if there has been improvement. Sorry for the paragraph i appreciate your time.","Doctor":"Ernie, the B12 is probably a red herring. It probably didn't cause the problem you started with or the arm sensations. When you have the constellation of things that are bothering you, it is reasonable to look for a systemic problem. It sounds as though your doctor has done that and not really found a culprit. Often, the problem is not an illness but a lack of some of the things that we all need to stay healthy.Specifically ask yourself and of your doctor about,Exercise:  Exercising every day for 20 minutes should be your goal.Is your body weight excessive. A little bit can go a long way if it is mostly in your belly where it affects sleep, joints, heart rhythm and when you're older, diabetes and heart disease.Abnormal sleep. Sleep disturbance is often present in people who are overweight, particularly those who snore. If you are very tired in the morning, sleep easily during the day and snore loudly, you may have sleep apnea. It is a common cause of abnormal heart rhythm requiring treatment."},{"Patient":"my father has had colon cancer twice and has had all of his colon removed.  On his mri scan they have now found a shadow on his liver, he is due to see his surgeon in a months time to discuss this, this seems strange to me that they are leaving it so long, he also has Addison's disease which has given him many complications.","Doctor":"Difficult to say without seeing the images. But one thing must be ruled out. If your father had colon cancer (even twice) there is the risk of developing liver metastases.  This means that there lesions due to colon cancer in his liver.So that's the question to ask whether this \\"shadow\\" is a liver lesion or not.

Is there any possible foods that I can give him to cure his hepatitis? I want to know more about it. Thank you so much for reading this. may God Bless you all.","Doctor":"If it was hepatitis A , that there is no problem. For hepatitis B or C he should be checked by an hepatologist.There is no diet that can cure his disease. I'm sorry. But there are foods that you must avoid in order not to make your liver more sick.So over consumption of alcohol, and fatty food, over consumption of sugar is a NO Go."},{"Patient":"I have had upper abdominal pain, mid back pain, pain between my shoulder blades, nausea, sever diarrhea and gas with clay colored stool for the past 12 hours.

It is less if you exercise and more if you don’t. If you are repeatedly concerned about your heart rate or rhythm, be sure that you are getting regular exercise. The absence of exercise may make you more aware of your heart.If you have had the symptoms evaluated and found no underlying heart disease or dangerous rhythm, the primary concern is to relieve your symptoms and anxiety. Finding nothing dangerous does not necessarily mean that heart rhythm is not the source of what you feel. On the other hand, an EKG periodically is not a way to find something. I usually recommend a long term monitor to try and catch the abnormal rhythm and tie it to the symptoms that you feel. Once you know what it is and that it doesn't matter, that alone makes it bearable.There are also tools that allow you to record your rhythm with the telephone. If a monitor finds nothing, you may want to look into one of these apps. If your symptoms only occur every few months, its great to try and catch it with the electronic device that goes every where that you go. You can then show the abnormality to your doctor."},{"Patient":"I have cirrhosis of the liver and have been under the care of a gastroenterologst/hepatoligst for the past 20 months.

Suboxone dose was 12 mg for first month, 10 mg for second month and 8 mg third month.  Two weeks after beginning suboxone therapy, she was developed mono and had acute symptoms for two weeks followed by moderate symptoms for two weeks.  The drug treatment center performed a standard liver panel and the following tests were abnormal: direct bilirubin - 0.6mg/dl (repeated), alkaline phosphatase - 134, SGPT (alt) - 82.  All other tests were normal.  The drug/alcohol screen at suboxone clinic intake indicated oxycodone was the only drug tested.  Subsequent routine screenings indicate no detected levels of drugs or alcohol except suboxone.  She also takes Yaz birth control pills and, occasionally, Imitrex for migraines.

The day following I had a terrible burning sensation in esophagus/stomach location. It killed and took milk of magnesia and went to doctor. Doctor sent to OR and all tests normal. The next day had a slight bit of dark stool and I assumed that it was from a mild ulcer that had bled due to throwing up. Doctor had gall bladder ultrasound and had ejection fraction tested. On my own I treated the pain as an ulcer and have not had an attack since before the ejection test. I told doctor this but the test came back with ejection fraction of 8%! I do not have any pain, feel great. I am taking an antacid and plan to discontinue. Doctor wants me to see surgeon to get gall bladder removed, but he says it is up to me. What would be symptoms of having this low ejection rate? I do not have any signs or symptoms of gallbladder disease..chalky stool, pain in back, etc. I feel great. I am 52, weigh 118 and don't eat alot of fatty foods.","Doctor":"Hello.The usual symptoms of a gall bladder problem would be right upper quadrant pain, nausea, and abdominal cramping and it usually indicates gallstones, but gall bladder hypokinesis--a poorly emptying gall bladder--can cause the same symptoms and, if they become frequent, then it is recommended that the gall bladder be removed.In your case, this doesn't sound like it's your gall bladder acting up and, were I your doctor, I wouldn't recommend removal."},{"Patient":"I had my lap coly surgery 10 days back.

It doesn t persist, it s only when I initially get my heart rate up, typically in a quick manner (for instance if I jump on a pull up bar and knock out a set of pullups, then do some dips, etc). This happens nearly everyday - I get an odd sensation in my stomach(?) - maybe more in my chest, but it eventually moves into the base of my throat, like an odd tickle, but there s definitely an odd sensation in my stomach / chest (hard to pinpoint the location). Then my mouth starts to create saliva at a very high rate, so high that I can lean over a sink and saliva will just continue to drip from my mouth (it forms under my tongue / the bottom of my mouth). This usually lasts about 30 - 60 seconds. After that I m good to go and I m able to exercise vigorously (brazilian jiu jitsu for upwards of 90 minutes). Any idea what the hell is going on when I initially bring my heart rate up?","Doctor":"Your heart rate response to activity is normal. The early rise with a change in activity is followed by settling in to a new heart rate over an average of about two minutes. that's why treadmill tests change every two to three minutes. The tickle and salivation combined with your activity capacity suggest reflux to be the cause. Abrupt change in physical activity and swings in the pressure in the abdomen and chest may trigger acid reflux."},{"Patient":"hi......i am suffering from hepatitic jaundice from past 18 days. at that time the bilirubin level was 8.20 and SGPT count was 5860...know it is decreased and the count is now 221...and the bilirubin is 9.50....is it improving according the way it should??? and with this there is gas problem.....what is the reason for that?????","Doctor":"hi.thank you for posting query at HCM.noticed your suffering from hepatitis.most likely, it seems HepA infection.

Also, small veins may have been closed during surgery which drain blood from labias. These are possible side effects of surgery but of course it ma not be the cause. There could be bartolini cyst or celulitis,especially if there is redness and pain so you should see gynecologist in this case.

I had the same experience again later that night. I went to the doctor the next morning. She did an EKG, gave me nitro and baby asprin, shoved an IV in my arm and sent me to the ER by ambulance. No heart attack. The symtoms continued and I ended up in the ER again a few days later. I saw a cardiologist - EKG showed an abnormal T-wave. Two weeks later I did a stress test - All good, no heart problems, EKG back to normal. I wore an event monitor for two weeks and recorded several events. From the monitor the cardiologist saw my pulse raise from 110 to 120, resting. She said that since the heart rythum was normal, she was not worried and discharged me from her care. I had a doctor order me Xanex to rule out panic attact. By the way, my chest x-rays were clear, all blood work normal - nothing out of normal other than high cholesterol. At my last visit with the cardiologist, my blood pressure was high 150/99. Now, the racing heart has subsided, but the chest pressure is almost constant. Per doctor s orders, I am checking my blood pressure two times a day - morning and night. It has been high (130+/95+) in the morning and (150+/100+) at night. My primary care gave me something for heartburn - after a week, no change, not better. I haven t felt good for 6 weeks. I know my body is telling me something is wrong.

You have had testing that looks for those causes. Having found nothing, you can be reassured on no emergency but that doesnt help the sensation go away. The blood pressure is not too disconcerting. Other considerations include musculoskeletal problems (sometimes hard to find), the esophagus (there's more to it than heartburn) and irritation of the lining outside of the heart. The best thing is to return to your primary doctor if symptoms persisted.

He has been a heavy drinker for 30 years, he is 48. For one thing he has been having rectal bleeding for years. Last year he lost a litre of blood and needed a transfusion. We went to the hospital as he was bleeding for 3 weeks a huge amount he didn't tell me until it was for many days. I talked him into going to the hospital. He told them his symptoms, they ordered bloodwork in the emergency dept. Just after they drew blood he fainted and his heartrate dropped down to 28 they gave him something to bring up his heart rate. He spent 3 days in the cardiac unit. He had his hemorrhoids banded then and again 2 months later. And now it looks like he needs to have them done again, as he is bleeding a large amount. He has a pattern with his bleeding he bleeds for about 2 weeks or longer then stops for  2 weeks. It always stops and starts back up? I worry he has cirrhosis of the liver, he is jaundice around his eyes, he is terribly irritable. And always has a hard time concentrating and snaps. What I am wondering is if this bleeding has anything to do with cirrhosis of the liver? Is it possible he could have this and that is why he has this bleeding? I have talked to him about his drinking and its no use, he refuses to listen. Could you give me an opinion on this.

What is most common in your case is muscular pain or pain originating from the pleura or pericardium (membranes surrounding the heart and lung). This is nothing serious about it and it will usually go by itself. It does however cause nasty pain and may last for months. Pain killers usually do the trick but what is best is to try and ignore the pain and it will eventually subside.

Apparently there were ultra sound test performed in 2008 and 2011 and endoscopy performed in 2011 that indicated that I had cirrossis of the liver and portal of hypertension.  I had an appointment with Dr. Mimari, a San Antonio General Surgeon to look at ultra sound film take last week and during that interview I ask him what the term \\"portal of hypertension\\" meant and the consequences of cirrossis as was indicated in the report accompanying the ultra sound film.  He proceed to advise me of the dire consequences of both cirrossis of the liver and portal of hypertension.  In response to his questions about what could have caused the cirrossis of the liver, I advised him that I was certain it was likely to be thru use of alcohol throughout my life.  I also advised him that I had quit drinking alcohol of any kind after being adivised of by the \\"call nurse\\" of my gastroenterologist, Dr. Shaffer, that based on his endoscopic examination that I had \\"the beginnings of cirrossis of the liver\\".  I asked the call nurse if Dr. Shaffer was going to set up an appointment to discussed the results of the endoscopic test and biopsey and she advised they would be calling me.

I can understand your concern. No, this is not normal. You had cholecystectomy done. Sometimes, post cholecystectomy, hepatitis is seen. This hepatitis can cause increase in bilirubin level and this raised bilirubin can cause generalized skin itching. So better to get done 1. Ultrasound examination of abdomen for liver parenchyma. 2. Liver function test including bilirubin, SGPT, SGOT etc. If all these are normal then vitamin B12 deficiency and allergy can be the cause. So get done vitamin B12 level and if deficiency then you will need supplements. For allergy, take combination of antihistamine (levocetrizine or fexofenadine) and anti allergic (montelukast)..

Your father is having chemotherapy induced hepatitis. Chemotherapy drugs are known too cause liver damage and so hepatitis is common.

However there are many other causes for derranged liver enzymes like hepatitis C, autoimmune liver disease, so get the tests for these to rule out these disease.I hope I have answered your query and this will help you .

What precautions/diet should be taken by me to avoid growth of polyps","Doctor":"Brief Answer:You should establish a follow-up plan with your GI doctor.These polyps should be followed-up using standard abdominal ultrasound or endoscopic ultrasound. Detailed Answer:Hello,Thank you for using HCM.First of all, is a good think that your polyp size is small, because eventhough in 95 % of the cases the polyps are benign , there are rare cases of cancerous polyps. The size of a gallbladder polyp can help predict whether it's cancerous (malignant) or noncancerous (benign). Small gallbladder polyps that are less than 10 millimeters in diameter, as in your case, are unlikely to be cancerous and generally don't require treatment. However, these polyps should be followed-up using standard abdominal ultrasound or endoscopic ultrasound, to look for changes that may be an indication of cancer. As in your case, most of the times, they are asymptomatic and are often detected incidentally. So how to deal with these polyps ?See a gastroenterologist and make a follow-up plan.In case of repeated pain or changes in their dimensions and morphology, consider cholecystectomy. In this way you avoid either long term surveillance of the polyps.Regarding diet, it should include fresh, fiber-rich fruits and vegetables such as avocados, cranberries, berries, grapes, cucumbers and beets, broccoli, bell peppers and oranges. You should eat lean meat, fish and poultry, avoiding red meat and all high-fat food in generally. You should drink plenty of water.Hope this is helpful.Let me know if you need more clarifications. Otherwise please close and rate the answer.Kind Regards, Dr. Juarda"},{"Patient":"my liver has enlarged occuping 3cm below Rt costal margin extending the gastric regine to the umblicus,and has mass at epigastric regine.now I have fever,vomiting,abd discomfort,skin color not chenged,no halitosis,no edema so what types of lab exam shall I do?","Doctor":"Hi thanks for contacting HCM...Noted you have liver enlargement with fever and vomitting with pain....So here it could be viral hepatitis like infection by hepatotrophic virus or it could be liver abscess like condition...Do following investigations....1.USG 2.Liver enzyme estimation sgpt and sgot3.viral marker study for hepatitis A, B, C ,E...4.Serum bilirubin 5.urine urobilinogen If abscess present then antibiotic given intravenous....And if needed surgical drainage might needed....If it is viral hepatitis keep immunity high...Cutt of oil....Fruits taken more....Green leafy veg more...Excess fatty and fried food avoided.One tsp carom and cumin seed with water taken daily...Sugar can juice , apple juice , caarot juice good one....Rest is important....Avoid strenous activity....Recovery will be gradual within month in hepatitis.....With keeping my answer in mind consult gastroentetologist....Tale care...Dr.Parth"},{"Patient":"hi my father is living in india,he is 60 year old,he is hypertensive controlled with atenolol 50mg & amlodipine 2.5mg,he also take fibrovas 3 times in a week,she had fatty liver from atleast 15 years,he now dsnt drink from atleast 3 years,now 7 days earlier he suffered from dengue & getting treatment for it he is taking paracetamol 500mg b.i.d.,vit.c 500mg b.i.d.,cefoxime &oflox combination o.d. from two days,for the previous 3 days i dnt knw about his prescription,we jus t got his blood test results,blood urea & sr.billiruin  are in normal range,platelets are 170000,but his sgot is 97 &sgpt is 57,actually now i told him not to take paracetamol unless u have fever,actually i m worrying lot about him,is this acute liver damage will subside soon,can you please tell me what medicine & precautions he should take,or we need to go for some other blood tests too  ?i will be very thankful to you.","Doctor":"thank you for posting query at HCM.yes, acute liver injury is reversible.increase in the level of liver enzymes(AST,ALT) reflect an INJURY to the Liver. medically, the condition is know as \\"Hepatitis\\". it maybe caused by:1.

Detailed Answer:Hello,Thank you for using HCM.First of all, is a good think that your polyp size is small, because eventhough in 95 % of the cases the polyps are benign , there are rare cases of cancerous polyps. The size of a gallbladder polyp can help predict whether it's cancerous (malignant) or noncancerous (benign). Small gallbladder polyps that are less than 10 millimeters in diameter, as in your case, are unlikely to be cancerous and generally don't require treatment. However, these polyps should be followed-up using standard abdominal ultrasound or endoscopic ultrasound, to look for changes that may be an indication of cancer. In most of the cases they are asymptomatic and are often detected incidentally. However,as in your case, the polyps may cause occasionally pain in the right abdomen, due to intermittent obstructions caused by small fragments of cholesterol that become detached from the gallbladder mucosa.So how to deal with these polyps ?See a gastroenterologist and make a follow-up plan.In case of repeated pain , consider cholecystectomy. In this way you avoid either long term surveillance of the polyps.Hope this is helpful.Let me know if you need more clarifications. Otherwise please close and rate the answer.Kind Regards, Dr. Juarda"},{"Patient":"DEAR SIR 1. SOME INVESTIGATIONS IN MY RESPECT ARE MENTIONED BELOW :- (i) VDRL-NON REACTIVE. (ii)Anti HCV - Negative.

So I agree with your doctor, no treatment is needed for the moment, but to make a follow- up plan , must be done some more laboratory exams such as quantitative HbsAg and HbeAg. HbeAg determines which strain of hepatitis B virus do you have. If the HbeAg is negative , you should evaluate ALT levels and HbsAg quantitative every 3 months during the first year. If the HbeAg is positive than you should monitor ALT and HbeAg every 6 - 12 months. Eventhough , i suggest this follow- up process to be guided by your GI doctor. Is important for your partner to be tested for hepatitis B, and if he is negative , he must be vaccinated. Hope this is helpful.Let me know if you need more clarifications. Otherwise please close and rate the answer.Kind Regards, Dr. Juarda"},{"Patient":"My daughter just had a j peg placed in her small intestine. She has been throwing up green bile every day since the surgery. She has no gall bladder. They stopped the tube feeding but she still throws up over 2 liters of at one time. This has been going on for over a week.","Doctor":"Brief Answer:She needs to undergo further examinations .Detailed Answer:Hello,Thank you for using HCM.Dear , I understand your concern , and i will try to clarify what's happening. PEG tube is not placed in her small intestine, it is passed into the stomach through the abdominal wall, to provide a means of feeding when oral intake is not adequate. The fact that from the PEG tube comes out bile, means that there is something which does not allow it to go in the natural route, from the bile duct (which comes from liver and pancreas) to duodenum (which comes directly after the stomach). So, due to any obstacle ,mechanical one, or due to the lack of adequate bowel movements, the bile turns back to the stomach and goes out from the PEG tube.  I would suggest you to see a gastroenterologist to advice you further examinations, such as abdominal ecography and fibrogastroscopy . A series of blood exams are also needed , such as bilirubin levels in blood and inflammation indeces.Hope this is helpful.Let me know if you need more clarifications. Otherwise please close and rate the answer.Kind Regards, Dr. Juarda"},{"Patient":"All my test values in LFT are in range except SGOT 48,SGOT 68 and SAP 226.I am tobacco addicted.Iam quitting this today.Is these values are for the tobbaco addiction and will quitting will help me in bringing these values in normal.
