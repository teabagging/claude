Solving this equation, we find (m = 1).Thus, the function simplifies to[ f(x) = e^{x+1} - ln(x+2) + ax(x+2) - 1, ]and the derivative becomes[ f'(x) = e^{x+1} - frac{1}{x+2} + 2ax + 2a. ]Next, we observe that (y = e^{x+1}), (y = -frac{1}{x+2}), and (y = 2ax + 2a) (since (a > 0)) are all monotonically increasing on the interval ((-2,+infty)).This observation implies that (f'(x)) is monotonically increasing on the same interval. Given that (f'(-1) = 0), it follows that- For (x in (-2, -1)), (f'(x)  0).Therefore, (f(x)) is monotonically decreasing on ((-2, -1)) and monotonically increasing on ((-1, +infty)). Consequently, the minimum value of the function (f(x)) is (f(-1) = 1 - a - 1 = -a).Hence, the minimum value of (f(x)) is (boxed{-a}).(Ⅱ) When (a=0), the function becomes (f(x)=e^{x+m}-ln(x+2)-m), and the derivative is (f'(x) = e^{x+m} - frac{1}{x+2}).Since (f'(x)) is monotonically increasing on ((-1, 0)), the function (f(x)) can exhibit one of the following behaviors within this range:1. If (f(x)) is monotonically increasing on ((-1, 0)), then (f'(x) geqslant 0), which means (f'(-1) geqslant 0). This results in (e^{m-1} - 1 geqslant 0), solving for (m) gives (m geqslant 1).Defining (g(m) = e^{m-1} - m), we find that (g'(m) = e^{m-1} - 1 geqslant 0), so (g(m)) is also monotonically increasing. Subsequently, (g(m) geqslant g(1) = 0), leading to (f(x) geqslant f(-1) = g(m) geqslant 0).2. If (f(x)) is monotonically decreasing on ((-1, 0)), then (f'(x) leqslant 0), which implies (f'(0) leqslant 0), yielding (e^m - frac{1}{2} leqslant 0). This implies (m leqslant -ln 2), and we get (f(0) = e^m - ln 2 - m geqslant e^m - ln 2 + ln 2 = e^m > 0). Hence, (f(x) geqslant f(0) > 0).3. If (f(x)) first decreases and then increases on ([-1, 0]), then (f'(x)) changes from negative to positive within that interval. This indicates ( exists x_0 in (-1, 0)) such that (f'(x_0) = 0), which leads to (e^{x_0+m} = frac{1}{x_0+2}). Taking logarithms, we get (x_0+m = -ln (x_0+2)).It follows that (f(x)_{min} = f(x_0) = e^{x_0+m} - ln (x_0+2) = -m = frac{1}{x_0+2} + x_0 = frac{(x_0+1)^2}{x_0+2} > 0). Therefore, (f(x) > 0).Combining cases 1, 2, and 3, we arrive at the conclusion that for all (x in [-1,0]), (boxed{f(x) geqslant 0})."},{"problem":"Given the sequence {a_n} with the sum of the first n terms S_n=3^{n}(lambda-n)-6, if the sequence {a_n} is a decreasing sequence, then the range of lambda is ______.","solution":"AnalysisThis problem examines the functional characteristics of sequences.

(1) Find the area of triangle ABC.  (2) Find the radius of the incircle of triangle ABC. Solution:# For Part (1):Given: AB=2, AC=4, and angle BAC=frac{pi}{3}.To find the area of triangle ABC, we use the formula for the area of a triangle using two sides and the sine of the included angle:[S_{triangle ABC} = frac{1}{2} times AB times AC times sin(angle BAC)]Substitute the given values into the formula:[S_{triangle ABC} = frac{1}{2} times 2 times 4 times sinleft(frac{pi}{3}right)]Since sinleft(frac{pi}{3}right) = frac{sqrt{3}}{2}, we can simplify the expression:[S_{triangle ABC} = frac{1}{2} times 2 times 4 times frac{sqrt{3}}{2} = 2sqrt{3}]Therefore, the area of triangle ABC is boxed{2sqrt{3}}.# For Part (2):To find the radius of the incircle r of triangle ABC, we first use the cosine rule to find BC:[cos(angle BAC) = frac{AB^2 + AC^2 - BC^2}{2 times AB times AC}]Substitute the given values and solve for BC:[cosleft(frac{pi}{3}right) = frac{2^2 + 4^2 - BC^2}{2 times 2 times 4} = frac{1}{2}]Solving the equation, we find BC = 2sqrt{3}.Next, using the formula for the area of a triangle in terms of its inradius and semiperimeter (S = rs, where s is the semiperimeter), we have:[S_{triangle ABC} = frac{1}{2} times (AB + AC + BC) times r]Substitute the area of triangle ABC and the known sides:[2sqrt{3} = frac{1}{2} times (2 + 4 + 2sqrt{3}) times r]Solving for r, we get:[r = frac{2sqrt{3}}{3 + sqrt{3}} = frac{2sqrt{3}}{3 + sqrt{3}} times frac{3 - sqrt{3}}{3 - sqrt{3}} = sqrt{3} - 1]Therefore, the radius of the incircle of triangle ABC is boxed{sqrt{3} - 1}."},{"problem":"10.

Given that the unit price of type B calculator is 10 more than that of type A, we can express the unit price of type B calculator as (x + 10) dollars.According to the problem, the quantity of type A calculators that can be purchased with 550 is the same as the quantity of type B calculators that can be purchased with 600. This gives us the equation:[frac{550}{x} = frac{600}{x + 10}]Solving this equation for x:[550(x + 10) = 600x 550x + 5500 = 600x 5500 = 50x x = 110]After substituting x = 110 back into the equation, we find that it satisfies the original conditions. Therefore, the unit prices of type A and type B calculators are 110 dollars and 120 dollars, respectively. So, we have:[boxed{x = 110 text{ dollars for type A, } x + 10 = 120 text{ dollars for type B}}]# Part 2: Finding the Minimum Cost for the PurchaseLet a represent the number of type A calculators purchased, and the total cost of the purchase be w dollars. Since the school plans to purchase a total of 100 type A and type B calculators, the number of type B calculators purchased is (100 - a).Given that the quantity of type B calculators should not exceed 3 times the quantity of type A calculators, we have the inequality:[100 - a leqslant 3a]Simplifying this inequality:[100 leqslant 4a 25 leqslant a]And since a cannot be more than the total calculators, we also have a leqslant 100. Combining these, we get:[25 leqslant a leqslant 100]The total cost w can be calculated as:[w = 110a + 120(100 - a) = 110a + 12000 - 120a = -10a + 12000]Since the coefficient of a in the cost equation is negative (-10 < 0), the cost w decreases as a increases. Therefore, to minimize the cost, we should maximize a, which is a = 100.Substituting a = 100 into the cost equation gives us the minimum cost:[w = -10(100) + 12000 = -1000 + 12000 = 11000]Thus, the minimum cost for the purchase is boxed{11000 text{ dollars}}."},{"problem":"Two positive integers a and b have the property that if a is increased by 25 %, the result will be greater than five times the value of b.

It states that for all x greater than or equal to 1, the expression frac{x^{2}+2x+t}{x} is greater than 0.Step 2: Simplify the inequality. Since x is positive (because x geqslant 1), we can multiply both sides of the inequality by x without changing the direction of the inequality. This gives us:x^{2}+2x+t gt 0Step 3: Rearrange the inequality to solve for t. This gives us:t gt -x^{2}-2xStep 4: Determine the maximum value of -x^{2}-2x for x geqslant 1. The function y = -x^{2}-2x is a downward-opening parabola, and it is monotonically decreasing on the interval left[1,+infty right). This means as x increases, y decreases, so the maximum value of y in this interval occurs at the left endpoint, x=1.Step 5: Calculate the maximum value of y when x=1:y = -1^{2} - 2(1) = -3Step 6: Since t must be greater than the maximum value of -x^{2}-2x for x geqslant 1, and we've found this maximum value to be -3, we have:t gt -3Therefore, the range of the real number t that makes the given proposition true is:boxed{(-3,+infty)}"},{"problem":"## 246.

Denote by x_{1}, x_{2} the roots of the equation x^{2}-p x-1=0 and by y_{1}, y_{2} the roots of x^{2}-q x-1=0.

So, we can assume that x_{1}, x_{2}, y_{1}, y_{2} in a suitable order form an increasing arithmetic progression. If x_{1}<y_{1} (the case y_{1}<x_{1} is analogous) then there are two possibilities:I.

(15 points) Several boxes are stored in a warehouse. It is known that there are no more than 60 boxes, and each of them contains either 59 apples or 60 oranges. After a box with a certain number of oranges was brought to the warehouse, the number of fruits in the warehouse became equal. What is the smallest number of oranges that could have been in the brought box?","solution":"Answer: 30.Solution. Let the number of boxes with oranges be denoted by n, the number of boxes with apples by m, and the number of oranges in the brought box by x. According to the problem, 59 m = 60 n + x. By moving 59 n to the left side, we get 59(m - n) = n + x. From this, it follows that n + x is a natural number divisible by 59, so it is at least 59. Also, since both sides of the equation are positive, we have m > n.If x leq 29, then n geq 30 and m geq 31, which contradicts the condition n + m leq 60. Therefore, x geq 30.It remains to note that for m = 30, n = 29, and x = 30, the condition of the problem is satisfied, meaning there could be exactly 30 oranges in the brought box.Alternative solution. Consider the situation with the smallest possible number of oranges in the box. Note that there must be more boxes with apples than boxes with oranges (otherwise, there would already be fewer apples than oranges in the boxes, and the brought box with oranges would not be able to equalize the number of fruits). Let the number of boxes with oranges be denoted by n; then n leq 29, otherwise the total number of boxes would exceed 60.We will prove that the number of boxes with apples is exactly one more than the number of boxes with oranges. Indeed, in any other case, there are at least n + 2 boxes with apples. This means that the number of apples in the boxes is at least59(n + 2) - 60 n = 118 - nSince n leq 29, this difference is at least 89. But then one box with apples can be removed, and the number of oranges in the brought box can be reduced by 59. This means that the considered case does not give the minimum number of oranges in the box, a contradiction.Then the difference between the number of apples and the number of oranges in the boxes is59(n + 1) - 60 n = 59 - nThis difference decreases as n increases, so the smallest value of the difference is achieved at the largest value of n. Therefore, this difference (equal to the number of oranges in the box) reaches its smallest value, 30, at the largest value of n = 29 (the total number of boxes is then exactly 59).## CriteriaThe highest applicable criterion is used:15 points. Any complete solution to the problem.12 points. The estimate is proven that there are at least 30 oranges in the box.Alternatively (if the above criteria are not applicable or give fewer points), the following advancements are summed:+8 points.

Rephrasing the Problem:   We start by rephrasing the problem. Given that ( K ) is an odd number such that ( S_2(K) = 2 ) and ( K = ab ) where ( a, b > 1 ) are positive integers, we need to show that if ( S_2(a) < l ) and ( S_2(b) < m ) for ( l, m > 2 ), then:   [   K leq 2^{lm-6} + 1   ]   Here, ( S_2(n) ) denotes the sum of digits of ( n ) written in base 2.2. Expressing ( K ) in Terms of Powers of 2:   Since ( S_2(K) = 2 ), ( K ) can be written as ( K = 2^x + 1 ) for some positive integer ( x ). This is because the sum of the binary digits of ( K ) being 2 implies ( K ) has exactly two 1's in its binary representation.3. Reduction to Inequality:   We need to show:   [   x leq (S_2(a) + 1)(S_2(b) + 1) - 6   ]4. Expressing ( a ) and ( b ) in Terms of Powers of 2:   Let:   [   a = sum_{i=0}^{|A|} 2^{a_i}, quad b = sum_{j=0}^{|B|} 2^{b_j}   ]   where ( A = {a_i}_{i=0} ) and ( B = {b_j}_{j=0} ) are sets of exponents in ascending order. Trivially, we must have ( a_0 = b_0 = 0 ).5. Lemma 1:   Consider the multiset ( A + B = {a_i + b_j mid a_i in A, b_j in B} ). Then:   [   sum_{l in A+B} 2^l = K = 1 + 2^x   ]   This is trivial since ( ab = K ).6. Lemma 2:   ( a_1 = b_1 ).   - Proof: By Lemma 1, ( sum_{l in A+B} 2^l = 1 + 2^x ). To combine the values in ( A+B ) to form ( {0, x} ), the smallest values in ( A+B ) must include ( {1, a_1, b_1} ). Since all values in ( {a_i} ) and ( {b_i} ) are distinct, the only way this is possible is if ( a_1 = b_1 ).7. Lemma 3:   ( |A||B| geq x - alpha + 2 ).   - Proof: ( |A||B| = |A+B| ). To combine the values in ( A+B ) to form ( {1, alpha, alpha, alpha + 1, alpha + 2, ldots, x-1} ), which is necessary to combine the two ( alpha ) in ( A+B ) to form ( x ), this set has size ( x - alpha + 2 ).8. Lemma 4:   Let ( a = m_a 2^alpha + 1 ) and ( b = m_b 2^alpha + 1 ). Then, ( m_a + m_b ) is a multiple of ( 2^alpha ).   - Proof: Since:     [     K = 2^x + 1 = ab = m_a m_b 2^{2alpha} + (m_a + m_b) 2^alpha + 1     ]     we must have:     [     2^{x-alpha} = m_a m_b 2^alpha + (m_a + m_b)     ]     Considering modulo ( 2^alpha ), we are done.9. Lemma 5:   ( |A| + |B| geq alpha + 3 ).   - Proof: Since ( alpha in A, B ), ( m_a ) and ( m_b ) must be odd. Thus, ( {1, 1, alpha, alpha, alpha + 1, alpha + 2, ldots, 2alpha - 1} ) is a subset of the multiset ( A cup B ).10. Lemma 6:    ( x leq (|A| + 1)(|B| + 1) - 6 ).    - Proof: Combining Lemmas 3 and 5, we have:      [      |A||B| + (|A| + |B|) + 1 geq (x - alpha + 2) + (alpha + 3) + 1 = x + 6      ]      Therefore:      [      x leq (|A| + 1)(|B| + 1) - 6      ]The final answer is ( boxed{ K leq 2^{lm-6} + 1 } )."},{"problem":"3.

Hence f(x) leq 1 for all x. From this we get f(x+y)=f(x) f(y f(x)) leq f(x) for all x, y, so f is non-increasing.Suppose there exists an x_{0} with fleft(x_{0}right)=1. Then fleft(x_{0}+yright)=f(y) for all y, and then fleft(k x_{0}+yright)=f(y) by induction on k. Also, by monotonicity f(x)=1 for all x leq x_{0}, and since any y can be written as k x_{0}+y_{0} with y_{0} leq x_{0}, we conclude f(y)=fleft(y_{0}right)=1 for all y.If there is no x with f(x)=1.

The binomial expansion of ((1 - x^2)^{10}) is:   [   (1 - x^2)^{10} = sum_{k=0}^{10} binom{10}{k} (-1)^k x^{2k}   ]   - The coefficient of (x^{10}) is (binom{10}{5} (-1)^5 = -binom{10}{5}).   - The coefficient of (x^8) is (binom{10}{4} (-1)^4 = binom{10}{4}).   Therefore, the coefficient of (x^{10}) in ((1 - x^2)^{10}(1 + 2x + x^2)) is:   [   1 cdot (-binom{10}{5}) + x^2 cdot binom{10}{4} = -binom{10}{5} + binom{10}{4}   ]5. Calculating the Binomial Coefficients:   [   binom{10}{5} = 252, quad binom{10}{4} = 210   ]   Thus, the coefficient of (x^{10}) is:   [   -252 + 210 = -42   ]Conclusion:[boxed{-42}]"},{"problem":"10.

They are listed below.1082,1172,1262,1352,1442,1532,1622,1712,18022081,2171,2261,2351,2441,2531,2621,2711,2801(d) Suppose that n is a four-digit integer and that A B C D is an integer with RD sum equalto n.From part (b), this means 1001(A+D)+110(B+C)=n. Note that A and D are bothnon-zero.Suppose there is some other integer, E F G H, with an RD sum equal to n.Again by part (b), this means 1001(E+H)+110(F+G)=n.Therefore, we have 1001(A+D)+110(B+C)=1001(E+H)+110(F+G).For convenience, set w=A+D, x=B+C, y=E+H, and z=F+G.The equation above simplifies to 1001 w+110 x=1001 y+110 z.Rearranging this equation, we get 1001 w-1001 y=110 z-110 x.After factoring, we have 1001(w-y)=110(z-x), and after dividing both sides of this equation, we get 91(w-y)=10(z-x).Observe that 91=7 times 13.The quantities w-y and z-x are both integers, which means 91(w-y) and 10(z-x) are both integers.Moreover, since 91(w-y) is a multiple of 13 , we must also have that 10(z-x) is a multiple of 13 .The integer 13 is prime and 10 does not have a factor of 13 , so z-x must have a factor of 13 .By similar reasoning, z-x must have a factor of 7 , which means z-x is a multiple of 7 times 13=91.Now recall that each of x and z is the sum of two digits.This means that each of x and z is an integer from 0 to 18 inclusive.The difference between two integers that are at least 0 and at most 18 must lie between0-18=-18 and 18-0=18.We have shown that z-x is a multiple of 91 that lies between -18 and 18 .The only such integer is 0 , which shows that z-x=0 or z=x.Since z-x=0,10(z-x)=0, which means 91(w-y)=0.Therefore, w-y=0 as well, so w=y.We have shown that if A B C D and E F G H have the same RD sum, then A+D=E+H and B+C=F+G.In other words, if n is the RD sum of a four digit integer, then the values of A+D and B+C are uniquely determined.This means, to count the number of four-digit RD sums, we can count the number of pairs (w, x) with the property that 1001 w+110 x leq 9999, subject to the condition that w and x are the sum of digits, with w being the sum of positive digits.Thus, the answer to the question is the number of pairs (w, x) with 2 leq w leq 18 and 0 leq x leq 18 that satisfy 1001 w+110 x leq 9999.If w=2, then 1001 w+110 x=2002+110 x, so we want 2002+110 x leq 9999 or 110 x leq 9999 - 2002 or 110 x leq 7997.The largest that x can be is 18 , so the largest that 110 x can be is 18 times 110=1980, which is less than 7997 .Therefore, if w=2, then x can be any integer from 0 through 18 .Thus, we get 19 pairs (w, x) when w=2.If w=3, then 1001 w+110 x=3003+110 x, which means we need 110 x leq 6996.As with the case when w=2, every possible value of x from 0 through 18 satisfies this inequality, so we get 19 pairs in this case as well.If w=4, similar reasoning implies that 110 x leq 5995, so we again get 19 pairs.Continuing this reasoning, we find that we get 19 pairs for each of w=5, w=6, w=7, and w=8.If w=9, then we must have that 9009+110 x leq 9999, so 110 x leq 9999-9009 or 110 x leq 990. It is not difficult to see that x can be any integer from 0 through 9 inclusive, but if x geq 10, then 110 x leq 990 is not true. Therefore, we get 10 pairs in this case.If w geq 10, then 1001 w is at least 10010 , so there is no way to choose x so that 1001 w+110 x has four digits.Therefore, there are no more cases to consider, and the number of possible four-digit RD sums is19+19+19+19+19+19+19+10=143"},{"problem":"6.

If we assume, which can also be shown to be valid by induction, that all A_{k}>0 for k=0,1, . ., n-1 (where we also set A_{0}:=1 for reasons of compatibility), then the answer is surprisingly simple: It suffices to require that between P_{1} and P_{k}, as well as between P_{k} and P_{1} in the sense of our cyclic orientation, there is an even number of points, since then for these two subsets of points, there is an admissible selection of chords for each subset by assumption.This now also clearly provides an inductive method for calculating A_{n} for n>0, namely:A_{n}=sum_{k=0}^{n-1} A_{k} A_{n-k-1} quadleft(n in mathbb{N}^{*}right)For example, we get:- A_{1}=A_{0} A_{0}=1 cdot 1=1.- A_{2}=A_{0} A_{1}+A_{1} A_{0}=1 cdot 1+1 cdot 1=2.- A_{3}=A_{0} A_{2}+A_{1} A_{1}+A_{2} A_{1}=1 cdot 2+1 cdot 1+2 cdot 1=5.- A_{4}=A_{0} A_{3}+A_{1} A_{2}+A_{2} A_{1}+A_{3} A_{0}=1 cdot 5+1 cdot 2+2 cdot 1+5 cdot 1=14With this, the last remaining point c) can also be answered very simply as follows:c) A_{5}=A_{0} A_{4}+A_{1} A_{3}+A_{2} A_{2}+A_{3} A_{1}+A_{4} A_{0}=1 cdot 14+1 cdot 5+2 cdot 2+5 cdot 1+14 cdot 1=42."},{"problem":"A total of  425 was invested in three different accounts, Account A, Account B and Account C.

First, we determine how many four-digit numbers can be formed from a fixed set of four digits. In the following considerations, we will denote non-zero digits by lowercase letters. Different letters never denote the same digit, and the symbol 0 denotes zero.The quartets of digits a, a, a, a and a, 0,0,0 each determine only one four-digit number. The digits a, a, a, 0 form three: a a a 0, a a 0 a, a 0 a a. From the digits a, a, a, b (a neq b), it is possible to form only four four-digit numbers: a a a b, a a b a, a b a a, b a a a.From the digits a, a, 0,0, we can form only three numbers: a a 00, a 0 a 0, a 00 a. For the digits a, a, b, b (a neq b), we have a total of six possibilities: a a b b, a b a b, a b b a, b a a b, b a b a, b b a a. This is still not enough.The digits a, a, b, 0 determine exactly nine numbers: a a b 0, a a 0 b, a b a 0, a b 0 a, a 0 a b, a 0 b a, b a a 0, b a 0 a, b 0 a a. By a similar procedure, we find that investigating further possibilities does not lead to a count of 9. An overview of all possible results is given in the following table.| Type | a 000 | a a a a | a a a 0 | a a a b | a a 00 | a a b b | a a b 0 | a b 00 | a a b c | a b c 0 | a b c d || :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: || Count | 1 | 1 | 3 | 4 | 3 | 6 | 9 | 6 | 12 | 18 | 24 |The given number thus has the digits a, a, b, 0, where a, b are different non-zero digits.We distinguish two cases and write the written addition of the three smallest numbers in each of them:begin{array}{rr}text { I. } ab a 0 a b & b 0 a a a 0 b a & b a 0 a a a 0 b & quad b a a 0 hline 12528 & 12528end{array}In case I, it is clear from the left two columns that a=4, and from the right column we get 2 b+4=8 or 2 b+4=18. The condition a<b is satisfied only by b=7. It is easy to verify that the digits a=4 and b=7 are a solution to the problem.In case II, it is clear from the right two columns that the number 2 a has the last digit 8 and at the same time 2 or 1. This, however, is not possible.Another way to solve case I: The indicated sum can be rewritten in the form 3000 a+100 a+10(a+b)+a+2 b=12528. By rearrangement, we easily find that a=4+frac{28-4 b}{1037}. From the condition that the last fraction is an integer k, we get b=7-frac{1037 k}{4}, a=4+k. It is clear that a, b will be digits only for k=0.Similarly, we can proceed in case II.Conclusion: The digits of the sought number are 4,4,7 and 0.GUIDING PROBLEMS:"},{"problem":"section*{Problem 4 - 171034}Give all prime numbers (p) for which (3 p+4=z^{2}) holds, where (z) is a natural number!","solution":"Assuming there is such a prime number (p), then with a natural number (z)[3 p+4=z^{2} quad text { so } quad 3 p=z^{2}-4=(z+2)(z-2)]Since (3 p) and (z+2) are positive, (z-2) is also a positive integer.

From the condition, it follows that the terms of the arithmetic sequence are natural numbers and the common difference, denoted by d, is positive. Let the letters A, B, C, D, E represent digits or numbers, and the corresponding two-digit numbers will be denoted by overline{mathrm{A}} and so on.Since overline{Phi mathrm{A}}-overline{mathrm{A}}=(10 Phi+mathrm{A})-(10 mathrm{~A}+Phi)=9(Phi-mathrm{A})=2 d, the value of d is a multiple of 9. Therefore, d is either 9 or 18. The value 27 or more cannot be taken by d, because in this case overline{text { ФА }}= D +4 d geq 4 times 27>100, which is impossible since the number overline{text { ФА }} is a two-digit number.First, assume that d=9. Then mathrm{E}=1, mathrm{~A}=2, mathrm{C}=3, Phi=4. Using the values of the found letters, we see that the record on the board becomes D, 1 overline{mathrm{E}}, 24,33,42. Then 1 overline{mathrm{E}}=24-d=24-9=15 and D =1 overline{mathrm{E}}-d=15-9=6. Thus, the numbers on the board are 6,15,24,33 and 42.Now assume that d=18. Since overline{text { ФА }}= D +4 d=Д+4 times 18=Д+72, then 81 geq overline{Phi А} geq 72, i.e., the letter Ф represents either 7 or 8. Consider both possibilities.If the letter Ф corresponds to 7, then the record on the board has the form D, overline{text { ЕЕ, }}, overline{mathrm{A}} 7, overline{mathrm{CC}}, 7 overline{mathrm{A}}. Since overline{mathrm{CC}}= overline{mathrm{A}} 7+d=overline{mathrm{A}} 7+18, the number overline{mathrm{CC}} ends in 5 and the record on the board becomes D, overline{text { ЕЕ }}, overline{mathrm{A}} 7,55,7 overline{mathrm{A}}. Then 7 overline{mathrm{A}}=55+18=73, overline{mathrm{A}} 7=55-18=37, overline{mathrm{BE}}=55-2 d=55-36=19 and D =55-3 d= 55-54=1. Thus, the letters D and B represent the digit 1, which contradicts the condition of the problem.If the letter Ф represents 8, then the record on the board has the form D, overline{text { ЕЕ }}, overline{mathrm{A}} 8, overline{mathrm{CC}}, 8 overline{mathrm{A}}. Since overline{mathrm{CC}}=overline{mathrm{A}} 8+ d=overline{mathrm{A}} 8+18, the number overline{mathrm{CC}} ends in 6 and the record on the board becomes D, overline{text { БЕ }}, overline{mathrm{A}} 8,66,8 overline{mathrm{A}}. Then 8 overline{mathrm{A}}=66+18=84, which is impossible since overline{Phi A}=8 overline{mathrm{A}} leq 81 must hold.Problem 3 Answer: 333.Solution. Let n be the smallest number written by Petya, and n+q and n+p, 0 leq q<p leq 7- be the numbers erased by Vasya. Then the sum of the remaining numbers is frac{(n+(n+7)) 8}{2}-(n+q)-(n+p)=6 n+ 28-(q+p)=2022. From this, 6 n=2022-28+(q+p)=1994+(q+p)=6 times 332+(2+q+ p). The value of n is minimal when the right-hand side is minimal and must be a multiple of 6. Since the numbers q and p are non-negative, the right-hand side is minimal when q+p=4. Then 6 n=6 times 333, i.e., n=333.Problem 4 Answer: proof.Solution. There are infinitely many such triples. For example, for any natural number n the triple left(n^{2023} ; 0 ; n^{2022}right) is an integer solution. In variant 2 (and 3), where the equation is x^{2023}+y^{2023}=z^{2024}, possible solutions are (n ;-n ; 0).Problem 5 Answer: frac{11}{30}.Solution. According to the problem, the length of the segment [B ; M] is frac{2}{3} of the length of the segment [B ; C]. Additionally, triangles D A K and B M K are similar with a similarity ratio of frac{2}{3}. Therefore, the length of the segment [B ; K] is frac{2}{5} of the length of the segment [B ; D]. Thus, for the areas of triangles B C D and B M K, the relation S_{B M K}=frac{2}{3} times frac{2}{5} times S_{B D C}=frac{4}{15} times frac{1}{2}=frac{4}{30} holds, and the area of the quadrilateral C M K D is S_{C M K D}=frac{1}{2}- frac{4}{30}=frac{11}{30}.![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_05_06_7222f67593c2cda60ca3g-2.jpg?height=357&width=716&top_left_y=2346&top_left_x=747)"},{"problem":"A1.

The answer is (B). The hypotheses of the problem translate to 1000 x + y = 7 x y, and we can rewrite this equation as y = frac{1000 x}{7 x - 1}. At this point, we can proceed in (at least) two ways:(a) we have y = frac{1000 x}{7 x - 1} geq frac{1000 x}{7 x} = frac{1000}{7} = 142.8 ldots, and on the other handy = frac{1000 x}{7 x - 1} = frac{1000(x - 1 / 7) + 1000 / 7}{7 x - 1} = frac{1000}{7} + frac{1000 / 7}{7 x - 1} leq frac{1000}{7} + frac{1000 / 7}{7 cdot 100 - 1} < frac{1000}{7} + 1,so y must be the only integer between 1000/7 and 1000/7 + 1, i.e., y = 143. From this, we immediately find that x = frac{y}{7 y - 1000} = 143 and thus x + y = 286.(b) alternatively, observe that x and 7 x - 1 cannot have common prime factors (since if p divides both x and 7 x - 1, then it also divides (7 x - 1) - 7 cdot x = -1, but no prime number divides -1). The fact that 7 x - 1 divides 1000 x implies then that 7 x - 1 divides 1000; on the other hand, by hypothesis x has 3 digits, so 7 x - 1 geq 7 cdot 100 - 1 = 699. The only divisor of 1000 greater than or equal to 699 is 1000 itself, hence 7 x - 1 = 1000 Rightarrow x = 143 and y = frac{1000 cdot x}{7 x - 1} = x = 143.

Identify the parameter p of the parabola: For the parabola y^2 = 4ax, the parameter p is related to a by p=2a. Given y^2 = 6x, we compare this with y^2 = 4ax to find 4a = 6, which implies a = frac{3}{2}, and thus p = 2a = 3.2. Use the definition of a parabola: The definition of a parabola tells us that the distance from any point on the parabola to the focus is equal to the distance from that point to the directrix. In this case, the distance to the focus |MF| is given as frac{5}{2}. The distance from any point (x,y) on the parabola to the focus can be expressed as x + frac{p}{2} because the focus is at (frac{p}{2}, 0) for a parabola oriented along the x-axis with the vertex at the origin. Thus, we have x + frac{3}{2} = frac{5}{2}.3. Solve for x: From the equation x + frac{3}{2} = frac{5}{2}, we solve for x:   [   x = frac{5}{2} - frac{3}{2} = 1.   ]4.

Based on the definition of a linear space, we check the following conditions.1. Are the introduced operations of addition and multiplication by a number closed in X, i.e., is it true that forall a, b in X and forall alpha in mathbb{R}a oplus b in X, quad alpha odot a in X ?If not, then the set X is not a linear space; if yes, we continue the check.2. We find the zero element theta in X such that forall a in Xa oplus theta=aIf such an element does not exist, then the set X is not a linear space; if it exists, we continue the check.3. For each element a in X, we determine the opposite element -a in X such thata oplus-a=thetaIf such an element does not exist, then the set X is not a linear space; if it exists, we continue the check.4. We check the fulfillment of the remaining axioms of a linear space, i.e., forall a, b, c in X and forall alpha, beta in mathbb{R}:a oplus b=b oplus a(a oplus b) oplus c=a oplus(b oplus c)alpha odot(beta odot a)=(alpha cdot beta) odot a1 odot a=a(alpha+beta) odot a=alpha odot a oplus beta odot a ;alpha odot(a oplus b)=alpha odot a oplus alpha odot b.If any of the axioms are violated, then the set X is not a linear space. If all axioms are satisfied, then the set X is a linear space."},{"problem":"Example 11. Let m, n, p be positive real numbers, and m^{2}+n^{2}-p^{2}=0. Find the minimum value of frac{p}{m+n}.

Such positive integers are all divisible by 9 since each has sum of digits 0+1+2+cdots+9=45. Hence we can change the number ' 11111 ' in the question to ' 99999 ' without affecting the answer. We denote such a 10-digit positive integer by overline{text { ABCDEFGHIJ }}. For this number to be divisible by 99999 , a necessary and sufficient condition is that overline{mathrm{ABCDE}}+overline{mathrm{FGHIJ}} should be divisible by 99999 (see Remark). Hence overline{mathrm{ABCDE}}+overline{mathrm{FGHIJ}} must be exactly 99999. In other words, each of mathrm{A}+mathrm{F}, mathrm{B}+mathrm{G}, mathrm{C}+mathrm{H}, mathrm{D}+mathrm{I} and mathrm{E}+mathrm{J} must be equal to 9 , i.e. we need only choose A, B, C, D, E.

There are 8 choices for mathrm{B} as it cannot be equal to mathrm{A} and mathrm{F} (once mathrm{B} is chosen, mathrm{G} is also fixed).

The divisibility test for 99999 is to put the digits into groups of 5 from the right, and then add up the numbers (as positive integers) in each group. The original number is divisible by 99999 if and only if the sum obtained is divisible by 99999 .

Claim: For all ( x, y in G ) with ( x^{-1}y notin H ), we have ( H^x cap H^y = {e} ):   Assume otherwise. Then there exist ( h_1, h_2 in H ) with ( h_1, h_2 neq e ) such that:   [   xh_1x^{-1} = yh_2y^{-1}   ]   This implies:   [   (y^{-1}x)h_1(x^{-1}y) = h_2   ]   But now ( H^{y^{-1}x} ) contains ( h_2 neq e ), which contradicts the assumption that ( H^{y^{-1}x} cap H = {e} ).2. Conclusion: For all ( x, y in G ), either ( H^x = H^y ) or ( H^x cap H^y = {e} ):   For each ( x in G ), the set ( G_x = { y in G mid H^x = H^y } ) has cardinality ( n ) (there are exactly ( n ) such ( y in G ) because ( H ) has ( n ) elements).   Thus, the ( G_x ) define equivalence classes, and there are ( frac{m}{n} ) such equivalence classes.3. Number of elements in ( bigcup_{x in G} H^x ):   Each equivalence class contributes ( n - 1 ) non-identity elements (since ( H ) has ( n ) elements including the identity). Therefore, the total number of elements in ( bigcup_{x in G} H^x ) is:   [   1 + frac{m}{n}(n - 1)   ]   where the ( 1 ) accounts for the identity element.The final answer is ( boxed{ 1 + frac{m}{n}(n - 1) } )"},{"problem":"To promote the concept of energy conservation, the country has implemented a regulation on central financial subsidies to support the promotion and use of efficient and energy-saving appliances. After the regulation was implemented, for each purchase of a certain energy-saving air conditioner fan, customers can receive a financial subsidy of 80. If 60,000 is used to purchase this air conditioner fan, the number of units purchased is 10% more than before the regulation. Find the selling price per unit of this air conditioner fan before the regulation.","solution":"To solve the problem, let's break it down into detailed steps:1. Identify the total subsidy amount and the increase in units sold: The total amount allocated for the subsidy is 60,000. The number of units sold after the subsidy is implemented is 10% more than before. 2. Define variables: Let x be the selling price per unit of the air conditioner fan before the regulation. 3. Set up the equation based on the given information: After the subsidy is applied, each unit effectively costs 80 less for the customers. Therefore, the effective price after the subsidy is x - 80. The number of units that can be bought with 60,000 after the subsidy is 10% more than the number of units that could be bought before the subsidy. This gives us the equation:   [   frac{60,000}{x - 80} = frac{60,000}{x} times (1 + 10%)   ]4. Simplify and solve the equation:   [   frac{60,000}{x - 80} = frac{60,000}{x} times 1.1   ]   Cross-multiplying to eliminate the denominators, we get:   [   60,000 times x = 60,000 times (x - 80) times 1.1   ]   Simplifying further:   [   60,000x = 66,000x - 66,000 times 80   ]   Bringing like terms to one side:   [   66,000x - 60,000x = 66,000 times 80   ]   [   6,000x = 66,000 times 80   ]   Solving for x:   [   x = frac{66,000 times 80}{6,000}   ]   [   x = 880   ]5. Verification: Substituting x = 880 back into the original equation to verify if it satisfies the condition:   [   frac{60,000}{880 - 80} = frac{60,000}{880} times 1.1   ]   Both sides of the equation should be equal, confirming that x = 880 is indeed a solution.Therefore, the selling price per unit of this air conditioner fan before the regulation was boxed{880 text{ yuan}}."},{"problem":"10.

On the first day, Vehicle A transports frac{1}{4} of the total goods. This leaves frac{3}{4} of the goods to be transported.2. On the second day, both Vehicle A and Vehicle B work together for frac{1}{2} day. In this time, Vehicle A continues to transport frac{1}{4} of the total goods because it transports frac{1}{4} of the goods per day. Therefore, in frac{1}{2} day, Vehicle A transports frac{1}{2} times frac{1}{4} = frac{1}{8} of the goods.3. Vehicle B, working together with Vehicle A for frac{1}{2} day, helps complete the transportation of all goods. We are trying to find out how long it would take for Vehicle B to transport all the goods alone, represented by x days.4. To represent the work done by both vehicles in the frac{1}{2} day, we consider the work done by Vehicle A and Vehicle B together. Since Vehicle A does frac{1}{8} of the total work in this time, the remaining work done must be attributed to Vehicle B. Therefore, the equation representing the situation is the sum of the work done by Vehicle A on the first day, plus the work done by both vehicles in the frac{1}{2} day, which equals the total work (1, or the whole batch of goods).5. The equation that correctly represents this situation is: frac{1}{4} + frac{1}{2} left( frac{1}{4} + frac{1}{x} right) = 1. This equation accounts for the work done by Vehicle A on the first day (frac{1}{4}), plus the work done by both vehicles in the frac{1}{2} day, where frac{1}{4} represents the part of the work done by Vehicle A and frac{1}{x} represents the part of the work that would be done by Vehicle B if it were working alone for a day.Therefore, the correct option that represents the situation is boxed{B}."},{"problem":"Given the curves C_1: begin{cases}x=-4+cos t,  y=3+sin tend{cases} (where t is the parameter), and C_2: begin{cases}x=8cos theta,  y=3sin thetaend{cases} (where theta is the parameter).(1) Convert the equations of C_1 and C_2 into standard form and explain what curves they represent;(2) If the point P on C_1 corresponds to the parameter t= frac{pi}{2}, and Q is a moving point on C_2, find the minimum distance from the midpoint M of PQ to the line C_3: begin{cases}x=3+2t,  y=-2+tend{cases} (where t is the parameter).","solution":"(1) Converting the curve C_1: begin{cases}x=-4+cos t  y=3+sin tend{cases} (where t is the parameter),into a standard equation yields: (x+4)^{2}+(y-3)^{2}=1,thus, this curve represents a circle with center (-4,3) and radius 1;Converting C_2: begin{cases}x=8cos theta  y=3sin thetaend{cases} (where theta is the parameter),into a standard equation yields: frac {x^{2}}{64}+ frac {y^{2}}{9}=1,thus, this curve represents an ellipse centered at the origin,with foci on the x-axis, major axis of length 8, and minor axis of length 3;(2) Substituting t= frac {pi}{2} into the parametric equations of curve C_1 yields: P(-4,4),Converting the line C_3: begin{cases}x=3+2t  y=-2+tend{cases} (where t is the parameter),into a standard equation yields: x-2y-7=0,Let the coordinates of Q be Q(8cos theta,3sin theta),thus, M(-2+4cos theta,2+ frac {3}{2}sin theta),therefore, the distance d from M to the line is d= frac {|4cos theta-3sin theta-13|}{ sqrt {5}},= frac {|5sin (alpha-theta)-13|}{ sqrt {5}} (where sin alpha= frac {4}{5}, cos alpha= frac {3}{5}),hence, when cos theta= frac {4}{5}, sin theta= -frac {3}{5}, d reaches its minimum value boxed{frac {8 sqrt {5}}{5}}."},{"problem":"7.

By using multiplication, we can find out what percentage of the cost price the selling price is, and then determine how much higher the selling price is compared to the cost price in percentage terms. This difference corresponds to 40 yuan. By using division, we can calculate the cost price.Let's denote the cost price as x. The original price after marking up by 20% is x + 0.2x = 1.2x. The selling price, after applying a 10% discount, is 1.2x times 0.9 = 1.08x. The profit is the difference between the selling price and the cost price, which is 1.08x - x = 0.08x = 40 yuan.

Determine the coordinates of the midpoints (M) and (N):   - Let (O) be the intersection of the diagonals (AC) and (BD). Since (O) is the midpoint of both diagonals, (O) divides (AC) and (BD) into equal segments.   - Therefore, (AO = OC = frac{AC}{2} = 5) and (BO = OD = frac{BD}{2} = 14).3. Analyze the movement of points (K) and (L):   - Since (AK = 28), point (K) lies on a circle centered at (A) with radius 28.   - Similarly, since (BL = 10), point (L) lies on a circle centered at (B) with radius 10.4.

If p vee q is a true proposition and p wedge q is a false proposition, determine the range of values for the real number m.","solution":"For proposition p to represent an ellipse with foci on the y-axis, the coefficients of x^2 and y^2 must be positive, and the coefficient of y^2 must be greater than the coefficient of x^2. This implies that 2m > 0 and m-1 > 0, which gives m > frac{1}{2} and m > 1 respectively. However, there is an error; the condition stating 2m < 1 - m yields 3m < 1, which simplifies further to 0 < m < frac{1}{3}. There appears to be an inconsistency in the original solution, so we revise the inequality to 0 < m < frac{1}{3}.    For proposition q, the eccentricity is given by e = frac{sqrt{5+m}}{sqrt{5}}, which must be greater than 1 and less than 2 for q to be true. Squaring both sides of 1 < e < 2 and rearranging gives us: 1 < left(frac{sqrt{5+m}}{sqrt{5}}right)^2 < 4 This simplifies to: 1 < frac{5+m}{5} < 4 Further simplification yields: 5 < 5 + m < 20 After subtracting 5 from all parts of the inequality, we get: 0 < m < 15 So we have 0 < m < 15 for proposition q to represent a hyperbola with the given eccentricity conditions.Since p wedge q is false, but p vee q is true, either proposition p is false and q is true, or p is true and q is false. This results in two cases:Case 1 (p is false and q is true):This gives us m leq 0 or m geq frac{1}{3} from the correct range of p and 0 < m < 15 from q. This means that the value of m that makes both propositions true at the same time is in the interval left[frac{1}{3}, 15right), since m has to be larger than 0 due to the condition of q.Case 2 (q is false and p is true):This gives us 0 < m < frac{1}{3} from p and m leq 0 or m geq 15 from q.

The slope of the tangent line at point A(2, -2) is therefore -9.Now, we use the point-slope form of the equation of a line to get the equation of the tangent: (y - y_1) = m(x - x_1), where (x_1, y_1) is point A(2, -2), and m is the slope found previously.Plugging in the values, we get: (y - (-2)) = -9(x - 2),  y + 2 = -9x + 18.

There might be a confusion with an alternative solution y = -2. However, this would represent a horizontal line, which doesn't match the slope we've calculated for the tangent at point A.

We write ( x = lfloor x rfloor + langle x rangle ), hence ( x^2 = (lfloor x rfloor)^2 + 2 lfloor x rfloor cdot x + langle x rangle^2 ).Thus, if ( leftlangle x^2 rightrangle = langle x rangle^2 ), we get that ( leftlfloor x^2 rightrfloor = x^2 - leftlangle x^2 rightrangle = (lfloor x rfloor)^2 + 2 lfloor x rfloor cdot x ) is an integer, so ( 2 lfloor x rfloor cdot x ) is also an integer. In particular, if we set ( k = lfloor x rfloor ), since ( k geq 1 ), we know that ( x ) is of the form ( frac{q}{2k} ). Since ( k ) is the smallest integer less than or equal to ( x ), we have ( k leq x < k+1 ), thus ( 2k^2 leq q < 2k^2 + 2k ). Let ( q = r + 2k^2 ) with ( 0 leq r < 2k ), then ( x = k + frac{r}{2k} ).Conversely, suppose ( x ) is of the form ( k + frac{r}{2k} ) with ( k geq 1 ) and ( 0 leq r < 2k ), we get that ( k leq x < k+1 ), so ( lfloor x rfloor = k ), thus ( langle x rangle = frac{r}{2k} ).Furthermore, ( x^2 = k^2 + r + frac{r^2}{(2k)^2} ) satisfies ( k^2 + r leq x^2 < k^2 + r + 1 ), so ( leftlfloor x^2 rightrfloor = k^2 + r ) which gives ( leftlangle x^2 rightrangle = frac{r^2}{(2k)^2} = langle x rangle^2 ): ( x ) is a solution.It remains to count how many such ( x ) are between 1 and 10: since ( k = lfloor x rfloor ), we must have ( 1 leq k leq 10 ). For ( 1 leq k leq 9 ), we have ( 1 leq k leq k + frac{r}{2k} < k+1 leq 10 ), so ( x ) is indeed between 1 and 10.

Let the points of intersection of the line S O with the sphere be P and Q (point P lies on the segment S O, and Q lies outside it). Let the radius of the sphere be r. Triangles O K S, O L S, and O M S are right triangles (angles at vertices K, L, M are right angles, as tangents are perpendicular to the radii drawn to the point of tangency). These triangles are equal by the leg and hypotenuse (O K=O L=O M=R, S O is common), therefore, angle K S O=angle L S O=angle M S O (let angle K S O=alpha, S O=x). The heights dropped from points K, L, M to the hypotenuse S O are equal, and their bases are the same point H, lying in the plane K L M (let's call this plane tau). Let beta and gamma be the tangent planes to the sphere passing through points P and Q, and E and F be the points of intersection of these planes with the line S K. By the condition, the areas of the sections of the trihedral angle by these planes are S_{1}=1 and S_{2}=4, respectively. Consider the section of the trihedral angle and the sphere by the plane S K O (see the figure and the notation on it). Since S H perp H K and S H perp H L, then tau perp S H. Then the sections of the trihedral angle by the planes tau, beta, and gamma are similar triangles, the planes of which are parallel (all of them are perpendicular to S O).If Sigma is the area of the triangle obtained by the section of the trihedral angle by the plane K L M, then from the similarity Sigma: S_{1}: S_{2}=K H^{2}: E P^{2}: F Q^{2}.

We have:  - (-1) + (-1) = -2  - (-1) + (1) = 0  - (1) + (1) = 2  Therefore, A^{+} = {-2, 0, 2}.- To find A^{-}, we look at the absolute difference of elements within A. We have:  - |(-1) - (-1)| = 0  - |(-1) - (1)| = 2  - |(1) - (-1)| = 2  Therefore, A^{-} = {0, 2}.Hence, A^{+} = {-2, 0, 2} and A^{-} = {0, 2}.# Part (2)Given that A = {x_{1}, x_{2}, x_{3}, x_{4}} with x_{1} < x_{2} < x_{3} < x_{4} and A^{-} = A, we have:- The elements of A^{-} include 0, (x_{2} - x_{1}), (x_{3} - x_{1}), (x_{4} - x_{1}). Since A^{-} contains exactly four elements and is equal to A, it implies that:  - x_{3} - x_{2} = x_{4} - x_{3} = x_{2} - x_{1}  By adding x_{1} and x_{4} to both sides of the equation, we get:  - x_{1} + x_{4} = x_{2} + x_{3}Therefore, we have proven that x_{1} + x_{4} = x_{2} + x_{3}.# Part (3)For a set A = {a_{1}, a_{2}, ldots, a_{k}} with a_{1} < a_{2} < ldots < a_{k} and A^{+} cap A^{-} = emptyset, we analyze the elements of A^{+} and A^{-}.- Since A^{+} contains sums of elements from A and A^{-} contains absolute differences, we observe:  - The number of distinct elements in A^{+} is at least 2k - 1.  - The number of distinct elements in A^{-} is at least k.  Given that A^{+} cap A^{-} = emptyset, the total distinct elements in A^{+} cup A^{-} must be at least 3k - 1.- Since the smallest element in A^{+} cup A^{-} is 0 and the largest is 2a_{k}, we have:  - 3k - 1 leq 2a_{k} + 1 leq 4041  Solving for k, we find k leq 1347. - By setting A = {674, 675, ldots, 2020}, we satisfy all conditions and obtain the maximum number of elements in A.Therefore, the maximum number of elements in set A is boxed{1347}."},{"problem":"If the sum of the slope and the y-intercept of a line is 3, then through which point is the line guaranteed to pass?","solution":"1.

The logarithm function is only defined for positive arguments, so we must have:2 - 2x > 0Solving this inequality, we get:2 > 2x1 > xThus, the domain of the function is (-infty, 1).Next, we analyze the monotonicity of y = log(2-2x). The function can be seen as the composition of two functions: y = log(u), where u = 2-2x. We note that y = log(u) is an increasing function for all u > 0. Therefore, to determine the intervals where y = log(2-2x) is decreasing, we need to examine the function u = 2 - 2x.The function u = 2 - 2x is a linear function with a negative slope, so it is decreasing continuously over its entire domain. Since u decreases on (-infty, 1), the composition function y = log(2-2x) will also be decreasing on this interval, given that y = log(u) is increasing for positive values of u.Hence, we conclude that the interval of monotonic decrease for the function y = log(2-2x) is (-infty, 1).

Solving ( f(w) = 17 ):   For ( f(w) = 17 ), we have:   [   w { w } = 17   ]   Let ( w = a + Delta_a ) where ( a ) is an integer and ( Delta_a ) is the fractional part. Then:   [   (a + Delta_a) Delta_a = 17   ]   This is a quadratic equation in ( Delta_a ):   [   a Delta_a + Delta_a^2 = 17   ]   Solving for ( Delta_a ):   [   Delta_a^2 + a Delta_a - 17 = 0   ]   Using the quadratic formula:   [   Delta_a = frac{-a pm sqrt{a^2 + 68}}{2}   ]   Since ( Delta_a ) must be non-negative, we discard the negative root:   [   Delta_a = frac{-a + sqrt{a^2 + 68}}{2}   ]   To ensure ( Delta_a < 1 ):   [   frac{-a + sqrt{a^2 + 68}}{2} < 1   ]   Simplifying:   [   -a + sqrt{a^2 + 68} < 2   ]   [   sqrt{a^2 + 68} < a + 2   ]   Squaring both sides:   [   a^2 + 68 < a^2 + 4a + 4   ]   [   68 < 4a + 4   ]   [   64 < 4a   ]   [   16 < a   ]   Thus, ( a geq 17 ).6. Solving ( f(z) = a + Delta_a ):   Let ( z = b + Delta_b ) where ( b ) is an integer and ( Delta_b ) is the fractional part. Then:   [   (b + Delta_b) Delta_b = a + Delta_a   ]   Solving for ( Delta_b ):   [   Delta_b = frac{-b + sqrt{b^2 + 4(a + Delta_a)}}{2}   ]   To ensure ( Delta_b < 1 ):   [   frac{-b + sqrt{b^2 + 4(a + Delta_a)}}{2} < 1   ]   Simplifying:   [   -b + sqrt{b^2 + 4(a + Delta_a)} < 2   ]   [   sqrt{b^2 + 4(a + Delta_a)} < b + 2   ]   Squaring both sides:   [   b^2 + 4(a + Delta_a) < b^2 + 4b + 4   ]   [   4(a + Delta_a) < 4b + 4   ]   [   a + Delta_a < b + 1   ]   Since ( Delta_a < 1 ), we have ( b geq a ).7. Solving ( f(y) = b + Delta_b ):   Let ( y = c + Delta_c ) where ( c ) is an integer and ( Delta_c ) is the fractional part. Then:   [   (c + Delta_c) Delta_c = b + Delta_b   ]   Solving for ( Delta_c ):   [   Delta_c = frac{-c + sqrt{c^2 + 4(b + Delta_b)}}{2}   ]   To ensure ( Delta_c < 1 ):   [   frac{-c + sqrt{c^2 + 4(b + Delta_b)}}{2} < 1   ]   Simplifying:   [   -c + sqrt{c^2 + 4(b + Delta_b)} < 2   ]   [   sqrt{c^2 + 4(b + Delta_b)} < c + 2   ]   Squaring both sides:   [   c^2 + 4(b + Delta_b) < c^2 + 4c + 4   ]   [   4(b + Delta_b) < 4c + 4   ]   [   b + Delta_b < c + 1   ]   Since ( Delta_b < 1 ), we have ( c geq b ).8. Counting the number of solutions:   We need to count the number of ordered triples ( (a, b, c) ) such that:   [   17 leq a leq b leq c leq 2019   ]   This is equivalent to counting the number of non-negative integer solutions to:   [   a' + b' + c' = 2002   ]   where ( a' = a - 17 ), ( b' = b - 17 ), and ( c' = c - 17 ). The number of such solutions is given by the binomial coefficient:   [   binom{2005}{3}   ]9. Finding the remainder when ( binom{2005}{3} ) is divided by 1000:   [   binom{2005}{3} = frac{2005 times 2004 times 2003}{6}   ]   Calculating modulo 1000:   [   2005 equiv 5 pmod{1000}   ]   [   2004 equiv 4 pmod{1000}   ]   [   2003 equiv 3 pmod{1000}   ]   [   binom{2005}{3} equiv frac{5 times 4 times 3}{6} pmod{1000}   ]   [   binom{2005}{3} equiv frac{60}{6} pmod{1000}   ]   [   binom{2005}{3} equiv 10 pmod{1000}   ]The final answer is (boxed{10})"},{"problem":"[Rectangle](https://artofproblemsolving.com/wiki/index.php/Rectangle) PQRS lies in a plane with PQ=RS=2 and QR=SP=6.

The answer is (A). We observe that N=10^{2024}+1 and that a divisor of the required form can be written as 10^{n}+1 for some 1<n<2024. Assume then that 10^{n}+1 divides N and writeN=10^{2024}+1=left(10^{n}+1right)left(10^{2024-n}right)+r_{1},from which r_{1}=-left(10^{2024-n}-1right). Since N is divisible by 10^{n}+1, r_{1} is also divisible by 10^{n}+1. Repeating the same process, we get-r_{1}=10^{2024-n}-1=left(10^{n}+1right)left(10^{2024-2 n}right)+r_{2},from which r_{2}=-left(10^{2024-2 n}+1right) is divisible by 10^{n}+1 (essentially we are performing a kind of long division, in which we allow the remainder to be negative).Iterating this reasoning, we obtain that 10^{2024-2 k n}+1 is a multiple of 10^{n}+1 for every k for which 2024-2 k n is positive, and similarly 10^{2024-(2 k+1) n}-1 must be a multiple of 10^{n}+1 for every k such that 2024-(2 k+1) n is positive. In particular, by choosing k appropriately, we can make 2024-2 k n or 2024-(2 k+1) n positive and less than or equal to n (essentially performing the division with remainder between 2024 and n): we then obtain that 10^{n}+1 divides a number of the form 10^{a} pm 1 with 1 leq a leq n. If a were strictly less than n, clearly 10^{a} pm 1 would be less than 10^{n}+1, and therefore could not be a multiple of it. Therefore, it must be that a=n and that the sign is positive, which happens only if n=2024-2 k n, i.e., 2024=(2 k+1) n.

There are sixteen such triples, namely (2,2,2), the three permutations of (2,2,3), and the six permutations of each of (2,6,11) and (3,5,7).","solution":"It can easily be verified that these sixteen triples are as required. Now let ( a, b, c ) be any triple with the desired property. If we would have a=1, then both b-c and c-b were powers of 2, which is impossible since their sum is zero; because of symmetry, this argument shows a, b, c geqslant 2.  Case 1. Among a, b, and c there are at least two equal numbers. Without loss of generality we may suppose that a=b. Then a^{2}-c and a(c-1) are powers of 2. The latter tells us that actually a and c-1 are powers of 2. So there are nonnegative integers alpha and gamma with a=2^{alpha} and c=2^{gamma}+1. Since a^{2}-c=2^{2 alpha}-2^{gamma}-1 is a power of 2 and thus incongruent to -1 modulo 4, we must have gamma leqslant 1. Moreover, each of the terms 2^{2 alpha}-2 and 2^{2 alpha}-3 can only be a power of 2 if alpha=1. It follows that the triple (a, b, c) is either (2,2,2) or (2,2,3).  Case 2. The numbers a, b, and c are distinct. Due to symmetry we may suppose that   2 leqslant abeta>gamma .   Depending on how large a is, we divide the argument into two further cases. Case 2.1. quad a=2. We first prove that gamma=0. Assume for the sake of contradiction that gamma>0. Then c is even by (4) and, similarly, b is even by (5) and (3). So the left-hand side of (2) is congruent to 2 modulo 4, which is only possible if b c=4. As this contradicts (1), we have thereby shown that gamma=0, i.e., that c=2 b-1.  Now (3) yields 3 b-2=2^{beta}. Due to b>2 this is only possible if beta geqslant 4. If beta=4, then we get b=6 and c=2 cdot 6-1=11, which is a solution. It remains to deal with the case beta geqslant 5. Now (2) implies   9 cdot 2^{alpha}=9 b(2 b-1)-18=(3 b-2)(6 b+1)-16=2^{beta}left(2^{beta+1}+5right)-16   and by beta geqslant 5 the right-hand side is not divisible by 32. Thus alpha leqslant 4 and we get a contradiction to (5).  Case 2.2. quad a geqslant 3. Pick an integer vartheta in{-1,+1} such that c-vartheta is not divisible by 4. Now   2^{alpha}+vartheta cdot 2^{beta}=left(b c-a vartheta^{2}right)+vartheta(c a-b)=(b+a vartheta)(c-vartheta)   is divisible by 2^{beta} and, consequently, b+a vartheta is divisible by 2^{beta-1}. On the other hand, 2^{beta}=a c-b> (a-1) c geqslant 2 c implies in view of (1) that a and b are smaller than 2^{beta-1}. All this is only possible if vartheta=1 and a+b=2^{beta-1}. Now (3) yields   a c-b=2(a+b)   whence 4 b>a+3 b=a(c-1) geqslant a b, which in turn yields a=3. So (6) simplifies to c=b+2 and (2) tells us that b(b+2)-3=(b-1)(b+3) is a power of 2. Consequently, the factors b-1 and b+3 are powers of 2 themselves. Since their difference is 4, this is only possible if b=5 and thus c=7.

Determine the smallest number p(n) such that there exists a procedure that, when followed, ensures we will know the n corresponding chest-key pairs after at most p(n) trials.","solution":"Solution. We will show that for n geq 1, p(n)=binom{n}{2}. The following procedure solves the problem in at most binom{n}{2} attempts, i.e., p(n) leq binom{n}{2}. Let the keys be k_{1}, k_{2}, ldots, k_{n}, and let b_{i} denote the lock that k_{i} opens. Our goal is to find b_{i} for every i. We try the k_{1} key in the first few locks until we determine which one is b_{1}. This requires at most n-1 attempts, because as soon as we have tried and failed (n-1) times, we immediately know that k_{1} must open the last untried lock. We do the same with the k_{2} key, with the restriction that we do not try the b_{1} lock. For similar reasons, we make at most n-2 attempts until we find b_{2}. Generally, after finding b_{1}, b_{2}, ldots, b_{i-1}, we find b_{i} by trying the k_{i} key in the remaining n-(i-1)=n-i+1 locks. Clearly, we will find b_{i} in at most n-i attempts. In total, we perform no more than sum_{i=1}^{n}(n-i)=binom{n}{2} attempts.On the other hand, we will show that p(n) geq binom{n}{2}, i.e., with fewer than binom{n}{2} attempts, we cannot be certain that we will always find the matching lock-key pairs. Suppose we try the keys in the locks according to a method that identifies the matching lock-key pairs and also minimizes the maximum number of attempts required. It is clear that using this strategy, we will never try a key in a lock if we are already certain that the key opens that lock. This means we must be prepared to confirm all matching left(b_{i}, k_{i}right) lock-key pairs based on a series of failed attempts.If this happens and for some 1 leq i < j leq n we have not tried either the k_{i} key in the b_{j} lock or the k_{j} key in the b_{i} lock, then based on the attempts we have made, we cannot rule out the possibility that the k_{i} key opens the b_{j} lock and the k_{j} key opens the b_{i} lock, while the other keys open the locks we thought they did. This would mean that we cannot be certain about the correct pairing of keys and locks. Therefore, for any 1 leq i < j leq n, we must perform at least one of the k_{i}-b_{j} or k_{j}-b_{i} attempts. Since these attempts are different for different (i, j) pairs, we need at least as many attempts as there are ways to choose different i and j, i.e., at least binom{n}{2}. This shows that p(n) geq binom{n}{2}, and combining this with the previously proven p(n) leq binom{n}{2}, we get the desired result p(n)=binom{n}{2}.Remarks. 1. The key step in the above proof is the proof of the lower bound, particularly the use of the \\"adversary method,\\" where we show that even with all negative attempts, we must still be able to pair the keys and locks correctly.2. The lower bound can also be stated in graph-theoretic terms. Consider the graph G whose vertices are the locks and keys, and edges represent the matching pairs. Clearly, each attempt corresponds to querying whether a potential lock-key edge is in G, and our goal is to determine G. The argument using the adversary method (adversary method) justifies that we must be able to determine G even if every meaningful query reveals that the edge is not in G. The proof given above can also be stated as follows: if G can be determined from the negative results of the queries, then for any i neq j, at least one of the k_{i} b_{j} or k_{j} b_{i} edges must have been queried.There is another way to prove the lower bound. If the negative results of the queries uniquely determine G, then the unqueried k-b edges cannot form an alternating cycle with the edges of G. Otherwise, it would not be possible to rule out that the keys and locks are paired along the edges of this cycle that are not in G. (In the above proof, we worked with a 4-length alternating cycle.) From this, it can be easily shown that some lock or key must have been involved in at least n-1 attempts. Suppose this is k_{n} or b_{n}. Similarly, it can be shown that among the b_{1}, b_{2}, ldots, b_{n-1} locks or the k_{1}, k_{2}, ldots, k_{n-1} keys, some (say the (n-1)-th) must have been involved in at least n-2 attempts where neither b_{n} nor k_{n} was used. Continuing this line of reasoning, it can be shown that the matching b_{i} k_{i} lock-key pairs can be indexed such that for every 1 leq i leq n, b_{i} or k_{i} was involved in at least i-1 attempts where b_{i+1}, ldots, b_{n} and k_{i+1}, ldots, k_{n} were not used.3. Several people attempted a similar line of reasoning. Some made the mistake of trying to prove that the graph of unqueried edges is acyclic. Unfortunately, this is generally not true. In fact, this graph cannot contain an alternating cycle with the edges of G. Fortunately, as the outline of the proof in the previous remark shows, this is sufficient for the lower bound."},{"problem":"12.

Let the 3-digit number be represented as overline{abc}, where a, b, and c are the hundreds, tens, and ones digits respectively.2. According to the problem, the hundreds digit a must be triple the ones digit c. Therefore, we have the relationship a = 3c.3. Since a is a digit in the hundreds place of a 3-digit number, it must be between 1 and 9. Similarly, c must be a digit between 0 and 9.4. We need to find the valid values of c such that a = 3c is also a valid digit (i.e., between 1 and 9). 5. The possible values for c are:   - If c = 1, then a = 3 times 1 = 3.   - If c = 2, then a = 3 times 2 = 6.   - If c = 3, then a = 3 times 3 = 9.6. Therefore, the valid pairs (a, c) are (3, 1), (6, 2), and (9, 3). This gives us 3 possible values for a.7. The tens digit b can be any digit from 0 to 9, giving us 10 possible values for b.8. Thus, the total number of 3-digit numbers where the hundreds digit is triple the ones digit is 3 times 10 = 30.9. The total number of 3-digit numbers is 900 (from 100 to 999 inclusive).10.

The second equation is satisfied by (mathrm{n}) (=9), although it is easier to see that there is a quadrilateral with the longest diagonal and shortest diagonals as one pair of opposite sides, and 9 -gon sides as the other pair of opposite sides. The angle between the longest side and an adjacent side is 60 , so that its length is the length of the shortest diagonal plus (2 times 9)-gon side (mathrm{x} cos 60). Hence that is the only solution for n odd.For (mathrm{n}=8) we have the same quadrilateral as for the 9 -gon except that the angle is 67.5 and hence the difference is less than 1 . For (n=10), (sin 2 pi / 10+sin pi / 10=sin pi / 10(2 cos pi / 10+1)) (<3 sin pi / 10<3 pi / 10<1). So there are no solutions for (n) even (geq 10), and hence no solutions for n even."},{"problem":"Given the function f(x)= begin{cases} 3^x, & x leq 0  log_{2}x, & x > 0 end{cases}, calculate f[f(frac{1}{4})].","solution":"We start with the inner function f(frac{1}{4}). Since frac{1}{4} is greater than 0, we use the definition of f(x) for x > 0, which is log_{2}x.Therefore, we find that fleft(frac{1}{4}right) = log_{2}left(frac{1}{4}right).Recall that log_{2}left(frac{1}{4}right) is the power to which 2 must be raised to get frac{1}{4}. As 2^{-2} = frac{1}{4}, this gives us fleft(frac{1}{4}right) = -2.Now, we calculate the outer function f[-2]. Since -2 leq 0, we use the definition of f(x) for x leq 0, which is 3^x.Hence, f[-2] = 3^{-2} = frac{1}{3^2} = frac{1}{9}.Therefore, f[fleft(frac{1}{4}right)] = frac{1}{9}.To summarize the process, calculate the value of the inner function first, then substitute that result into the outer function. It is important to pay attention to the range of the function's domain to avoid mistakes.boxed{text{The final answer is } frac{1}{9}.}"},{"problem":"A ball is floating on the surface of a lake. After the water freezes and the ball is removed, a hole with a diameter of 12 cm and a depth of 2 cm is left in the ice. The radius of the ball is ____ cm, and its surface area is ____ cm².","solution":"Let r be the radius of the ball. The hole represents a cap of the sphere that was submerged in water.1. The radius of the hole is half of its diameter, so it is 12 text{ cm} div 2 = 6 text{ cm}.2. Using the right-angled triangle composed of the radius of the ball (r), the radius of the hole (6 cm), and the segment from the center of the ball to the rim of the hole (r - 2 cm, which is the depth of the hole subtracted from the radius of the ball), we can apply the Pythagorean theorem:    (r - 2)^2 + 6^2 = r^23. Simplifying the equation yields:    r^2 - 4r + 4 + 36 = r^2     r^2 - r^2 - 4r + 40 = 0     -4r + 40 = 0     r = frac{40}{4}     r = 10 text{ cm} 4.

Find the sum of the elements of mathcal{S}.","solution":"1. We start by understanding the set mathcal{S}, which consists of numbers that can be written as repeating decimals of the form 0.overline{abc}, where a, b, c are distinct digits. Each number in mathcal{S} can be expressed as a fraction:   [   0.overline{abc} = frac{abc}{999}   ]   where abc is a three-digit number formed by the digits a, b, c.2. The total number of such three-digit numbers abc where a, b, c are distinct digits is calculated as follows:   - There are 10 choices for a (0 through 9).   - There are 9 remaining choices for b (excluding the digit chosen for a).   - There are 8 remaining choices for c (excluding the digits chosen for a and b).   Therefore, the total number of distinct three-digit numbers abc is:   [   10 times 9 times 8 = 720   ]3. Next, we need to find the sum of all elements in mathcal{S}. Notice that for each k in the set {012, 013, ldots, 986, 987}, there is a corresponding (1000 - k) such that:   [   frac{k}{999} + frac{1000 - k}{999} = frac{1000}{999} = 1   ]   This means that each pair (k, 1000 - k) sums to 1.4. Since there are 720 elements in mathcal{S}, there are frac{720}{2} = 360 such pairs. Each pair sums to 1, so the total sum of all elements in mathcal{S} is:   [   360 times 1 = 360   ]The final answer is boxed{360}."},{"problem":"3.

It is known that the minimum number of moves it takes for the knight to reach the upper right corner is equal to the minimum number of moves it takes to reach the lower right corner. Find n.#","solution":"Let n be even. In this case, the lower left field has the same color as the upper right, while the lower right has a different color. After each move, the knight lands on a field of the opposite color. Therefore, any path from the lower left corner to the upper right consists of an even number of moves, and to the lower right - of an odd number.Thus, their lengths are different.: Let n=4 k+1. Then, by moving alternately along the fields of the two lower rows, the knight will reach the lower right corner in 2 k moves.We will show that the path to the upper right corner is longer. Each move shifts the knight by a total of 3 fields horizontally and vertically. Even moving consistently to the right-up, the knight will move 6 k fields in 2 k moves. The total distance horizontally and vertically from the lower left corner to the upper right is 2 n-2 = 8 k > 6 k. Therefore, the shortest path to the upper right field is longer.Let n=4 k-1. Then the lower right field can be reached in 2 k moves as follows: the first move is one field to the right and two up, the second is one to the right and two down, and then, as in the previous case, move alternately along the fields of the two lower rows. It is impossible to get there in fewer moves.Indeed, the knight needs to move n-1=4 k-2 cells to the right, and each move shifts it a maximum of two cells to the right. Therefore, the number of moves is at least 2 k-1. But after 2 k-1 moves, the knight will land on a field of the opposite color, and in our case, the lower right corner has the same color as the lower left, so at least one more move is needed, meaning the number of moves is at least 2 k.The maximum total shift to the right and up in 2 k moves remains 6 k. The total distance horizontally and vertically from the lower left field to the upper right is 2 n-2 = 8 k-4. For k>2, this is more than 6 k. For k=1 (n=3), it is easy to check all options and see that this case does not work. However, for k=2 (n=7), both shortest paths consist of four moves, and this is also easy to verify.## Answern=7.Send a comment"},{"problem":"Problem 5.8.
