How many spheres exist that touch all the faces of the given triangular pyramid T?","solution":"3. The task is to determine how many points (centers of the sought spheres) are equidistant from the four faces of the pyramid.The geometric locus of points equidistant from the faces of a given dihedral angle is a plane passing through the edge of the dihedral angle and bisecting this angle — the bisector plane of the dihedral angle.Since two intersecting planes form two pairs of vertical dihedral angles, the geometric locus of points equidistant from two intersecting planes consists of two planes passing through the line of intersection of the first two planes.The geometric locus of points equidistant from the faces of a trihedral angle is the line of intersection of the bisector planes of the three dihedral angles of the trihedral angle — the bisector line of the trihedral angle.Since three intersecting planes form four pairs of vertical trihedral angles, the geometric locus of points equidistant from three intersecting planes consists of four lines passing through the point of intersection of the three planes.Let mathrm{II}_{1}, mathrm{II}_{2}, mathrm{II}_{3}, and mathrm{II}_{4} be the planes of the faces of the pyramid. Consider the trihedral angle of the pyramid formed by the planes mathrm{II}_{1}, mathrm{II}_{2}, and mathrm{II}_{3}. The geometric locus of points equidistant from the three faces of this angle consists of four lines beta_{1}, beta_{2}, beta_{3}, and beta_{4}. Further, the geometric locus of points equidistant from the planes mathrm{II}_{1} and mathrm{II}_{4} consists of two planes B_{1} and B_{2}. It is clear that each of the points of intersection of one of the lines beta_{1}, beta_{2}, beta_{3}, and beta_{4} with one of the planes B_{1} and B_{2} (and only these points) will be equidistant from the planes mathrm{II}_{1}, mathrm{II}_{2}, mathrm{II}_{3}, and mathrm{II}_{4}. Thus, in general, we obtain eight points equidistant from the planes of the faces of the pyramid, and consequently, eight spheres tangent to these faces.

For example, a regular tetrahedron has only five such spheres (spheres of only the types shown in Fig. 35, a and b). This is because in some cases, some of the lines beta_{1}, beta_{2}, beta_{3}, and beta_{4} may be parallel to some of the planes B_{1} and B_{2}.Remark. It can be shown that if the sum of the areas of two faces of a triangular pyramid is equal to the sum of the areas of the other two faces, then there are only 7 spheres tangent to the planes of all the faces; if the areas of the faces are pairwise equal, then there are 6 such spheres; finally, if all the faces of the pyramid are equal in area (and therefore equal; see, for example, problem 29 in the book by D.

The formation cannot consist of only liars (in such a case, 4-8 would be telling the truth). Consider the tallest knight, let's call him R.

Initial Conditions and Sequence Definition:   - Given ( a_0 = 1 ) and ( a_1 = 3 ).   - The sequence satisfies ( a_0 + a_1 + cdots + a_{n-1} geq 3a_n - a_{n+1} ) for any integer ( n geq 1 ).2.

Inductive Step:   - We need to show that ( S_n > 2S_{n-1} ) for all ( n geq 1 ).   - Base case: ( S_0 = 1 ) and ( S_1 = 4 ) (since ( S_1 = a_0 + a_1 = 1 + 3 = 4 )).   - Assume ( S_k > 2S_{k-1} ) for some ( k geq 1 ).4.

Ratio of Consecutive Terms:   - From ( S_n > 2S_{n-1} ), we have:     [     a_{n+1} - 2a_n geq a_n - S_{n-1} = S_n - 2S_{n-1} > 0     ]   - Thus, ( frac{a_{n+1}}{a_n} > 2 ).7. Upper Bound for ( M ):   - To show that ( M > 2 ) does not hold, consider ( a_{n+1} = 3a_n - S_{n-1} ).   - Then ( S_{n+1} = 4S_n - 4S_{n-1} ).   - Given ( S_0 = 1 ) and ( S_1 = 4 ), we have ( S_n = 2^n + n cdot 2^n = (n+2) cdot 2^n ).   - Therefore, ( a_n = S_n - S_{n-1} = (n+2) cdot 2^{n-1} ).8.

Therefore, for A and B to be equal, frac{y}{x} must correspond to 0 in set A.   - This leads to frac{y}{x} = 0, which simplifies to y = 0.3. To find the value of x, we look at the condition |x| = 2. This implies x = pm 2.   - If x = 2, then frac{1}{x} = frac{1}{2}, which does not satisfy the condition for equality of sets A and B because there is no frac{1}{2} in set A.   - If x = -2, then frac{1}{x} = -frac{1}{2}, which again does not satisfy the condition for equality of sets A and B.4. The condition |x| = x indicates that x is a non-negative number. Given frac{1}{x} = 2, we solve for x to get x = frac{1}{2}, which is a non-negative number and satisfies the condition for equality of sets A and B.5. Therefore, we find x = frac{1}{2} and y = 0.

We will call a point a finishing point if Kolya can reach it after the 2020th jump. For what largest number  N  can there be an initial arrangement of grasshoppers for which there are exactly  N  different possible finishing points?","solution":"Evaluation. Method 1. Introduce a coordinate system on the plane so that Kolya is sitting at the point (0,0) . Let (mid operatorname{vec}{mathrm{a}}_1 ), (mid operatorname{vec}{mathrm{a}}_2 ), (ldots), (mid operatorname{vec}{mathrm{a}}_{2020} ) be the radius vectors of the grasshoppers in the order of their jumping over Kolya.

The number of different sums is (C_{2020} text{ choose } 1010) (selecting 1010 terms from the odd positions).Method 2. Notice that if a grasshopper jumps over some point (A) and then over some point (B), it will ultimately move by the vector (2overrightarrow{AB} = 2(overrightarrow{OB} - overrightarrow{OA})). Each finish point can be associated with a sequence in which Kolya jumps over his friends to end up in this point after 2020 jumps—i.e., a permutation of the numbers from 1 to 2020 (consider all grasshoppers, except Kolya, numbered). Suppose Kolya at some point is at point (0) and is about to jump over grasshoppers located at points (A), (B), (C) (considering only three consecutive jumps). If Kolya makes these jumps in the order (ABC), he will first move by the vector (2overrightarrow{OA}) and then by the vector (2overrightarrow{BC} = 2(overrightarrow{OC} - overrightarrow{OB})), so in total, after three jumps, he will move by the vector (2(overrightarrow{OA} + overrightarrow{OC} - overrightarrow{OB})). If Kolya makes these jumps in the order (CBA), he will similarly move by the vector (2(overrightarrow{OC} + overrightarrow{OA} - overrightarrow{OB})), ending up in the same point as in the previous case. Thus, in the sequence of Kolya's jumps, any two grasshoppers standing one apart can be swapped without changing the finish point. Therefore, the finish point is characterized not by the permutation of the numbers from 1 to 2020 (of which there are 2020!), but only by which numbers stand in the odd positions in such a permutation. Accordingly, the number of different finish points cannot exceed (C_{2020}^{1010}).Example. Place the grasshoppers at points on the number line with coordinates 0 (Kolya's position), 1, 3, (3^2), ..., (3^{2019}). Prove that all sums of powers of three with coefficients (pm 1) are different. By adding the constant sum (1 + 3 + 3^2 + ldots + 3^{2019}) to such a sum, we get a sum with coefficients 0 and 2. It corresponds to a 2020-digit ternary number consisting of zeros and twos, and all such numbers are different.## [ Examples and counterexamples.

What is the probability that no three heads follow each other?","solution":"I. Solution. The probability to be calculated is the ratio of the number of favorable elementary events to the total number of elementary events.The total number of elementary events is the number of 12-long head-tail sequences. There are 2^{12}=4096 such sequences, since at each of the 12 tosses, we can get either a head or a tail with equal probability.The number of favorable elementary events is the number of head-tail sequences in which three heads do not follow each other. Let's count these cases.Let's count according to how many tails are in them. Let i be the number of tails, i takes values from 0 to 12.The i tails divide the sequence into i+1 \\"parts\\". In these i+1 parts, 12-i heads are distributed such that in each part there can be 0, 1, or 2 of them.If i=12, then three heads definitely do not follow each other. Therefore, 12 tails have 1 possible arrangement.If i=11, then the 1 head can stand in any of the 12 parts, which is binom{12}{1}=12 possibilities.If i=10, then the 2 heads can be placed in a pair in 11 parts, which is binom{11}{1}=11 possibilities; or separately, which is binom{11}{2}=55 possibilities. Together, this is11+55=66possibilities.If i=9, then in the 10 parts created, the 3 heads can stand in a pair and one separately, which is binom{10}{1} cdotbinom{9}{1}=90 possibilities; or separately, which is binom{10}{3}=120 possibilities. Together, this is120+90=210possibilities.If i=8, then 9 parts are created. The 4 heads can stand in two pairs, which is binom{9}{2}=36 sequences; in one pair and two separately, which is binom{9}{2} cdotbinom{7}{1}=252 sequences; or separately, which is binom{9}{4}=126 possibilities. Together, this is126+252+36=414sequences.Similarly, for any i, it is useful to count the number of possibilities according to how many parts there are where the heads stand in pairs. Since 12-i heads fall into i+1 parts, the number of pairs of heads is at most left[frac{12-i}{2}right]. If the number of pairs of heads is 0 leq k leqleft[frac{12-i}{2}right], then the number of possibilities is binom{i+1}{k}binom{i+1-k}{12-i-2 k}, because from the i+1 parts, we can choose binom{i+1}{k} ways to select which parts the heads stand in pairs, and from the remaining i+1-k places, there are binom{i+1-k}{12-i-2 k} possibilities to choose where to place the remaining 12-i-2 k heads.Based on this, the number of possibilities for i=7 (where 0 leq k leq 2) is:binom{8}{0}binom{8}{5}+binom{8}{1}binom{7}{3}+binom{8}{2}binom{6}{1}=56+280+168=504If i=6, then 0 leq k leq 3 and the number of possibilities isbinom{7}{0}binom{7}{6}+binom{7}{1}binom{6}{4}+binom{7}{2}binom{5}{2}+binom{7}{3}binom{4}{0}=7+105+210+35=357If i=5, then 0 leq k leq 3, and for thisbinom{6}{0}binom{6}{7}+binom{6}{1}binom{5}{5}+binom{6}{2}binom{4}{3}+binom{6}{3}binom{3}{1}=0+6+60+60=126possibilities exist.For i=4, the number of possibilities (where 0 leq k leq 4) is:begin{gathered}binom{5}{0}binom{5}{8}+binom{5}{1} binom{4}{6}+binom{5}{2}binom{3}{4}+binom{5}{3}binom{2}{2}+binom{5}{4}binom{1}{0}= =0+0+0+10+5=15end{gathered}If i leq 4, then every term in the sum is 0. (This also follows from the fact that at most 4 parts are created, but at least 9 heads are tossed, and for the placement of these heads in pairs, at least 5 parts would be needed.) Therefore, for fewer than 4 tails, no suitable sequence can be formed.In total,1+12+66+210+414+504+357+126+15=1705suitable sequences exist, so the desired probability is frac{1705}{4096} approx 0.416.II. Solution. Let's try to determine how many sequences of length n do not contain three consecutive heads. Let's call such sequences \\"good sequences\\" and denote their number by D_{n}.Consider the last element of a good sequence of length n.If this is a tail, then the sequence is good exactly when the first (n-1) elements form a good sequence. The number of such sequences is therefore D_{n-1}.If the last element is a head and the second-to-last is a tail, then the sequence is good exactly when the first (n-2) elements form a good sequence. The number of such sequences is therefore D_{n-2}.If the last and the second-to-last elements are heads, then the sequence is good only if the (n-2)-th element is not a head and the sequence formed by the first (n-3) elements does not contain three consecutive heads, i.e., it is a good sequence. The number of such sequences is therefore D_{n-3}.A sequence of length n falls into exactly one of the above cases, so it holds that D_{n}=D_{n-3}+D_{n-2}+D_{n-1}.Since the tosses are independent, and at each toss, the probability of getting a tail or a head is 1/2, the probability that a sequence of n tosses is good is frac{D_{n}}{2^{n}}.In the problem, n=12, so we need to determine D_{12} using the recursive formula. For 1 or 2 tosses, three consecutive heads definitely do not appear, so D_{1}=2^{1}=2 and D_{2}=2^{2}=4. For 3 tosses, the HHH sequence is not good, so D_{3}=2^{3}-1=7. From here, D_{4}=D_{1}+D_{2}+D_{3}=2+4+7=13 ; D_{5}=D_{2}+D_{3}+D_{4}=4+7+13=24 ; D_{6}=44 ; D_{7}=81 ; D_{8}=149 ; D_{9}=274 ; D_{10}=504 ; D_{11}=927 ; D_{12}=274+504+927=1705.The desired probability is frac{1705}{2^{12}}=frac{1705}{4096} approx 0.42."},{"problem":"Given that S_n is the sum of the first n terms of an arithmetic sequence {a_n}, if a_5=5a_3, then frac{S_9}{S_5}=　　()A: frac{18}{5}B: 5C: 9D: frac{9}{25}","solution":"Since a_5=5a_3,  we have frac{S_9}{S_5}= frac{frac{9(a_1+a_9)}{2}}{frac{5(a_1+a_5)}{2}}= frac{9a_5}{5a_3}= frac{9×5}{5}=9.

(We are temporarily ignoring the size ordering condition in the original question.)Since the product a b c has two factors of 2 , then a, b and c have a total of two factors of 2.There are 6 ways in which this can happen: both factors in a, both factors in b, both in c, one each in a and b, one each in a and c, and one each in b and c.Similarly, there are 6 ways of distributing each of the other squares of prime factors.Since a b c includes exactly 8 squares of prime factors and each can be distributed in 6 ways, there are 6^{8} ways of building triples (a, b, c) using the prime factors, and so there are 6^{8} triples (a, b, c) with the required product.Next, we include the condition no pair of a, b and c should be equal. (We note that a, b and c cannot all be equal, since their product is not a perfect cube.)We count the number of triples with one pair equal, and subtract this number from 6^{8}.We do this by counting the number of these triples with a=b.

On an 8 times 8 chessboard, tokens are placed according to the following rule. Initially, the board is empty. A move consists of placing a token on any free square. With this move, exactly one of the tokens that ends up adjacent to it is removed from the board (if there is such an adjacent token). What is the maximum number of tokens that can be placed on the board, considering the specified rule? Adjacent squares are those that are nearest horizontally, vertically, and diagonally. Solution.The number of tokens on the board can be increased by one only when a new token is placed on a completely free square, i.e., a square all of whose adjacent squares are free of tokens.![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_05_06_cca78509636089d39cb9g-1.jpg?height=748&width=1678&top_left_y=1022&top_left_x=201)Let's highlight one horizontal row A1-H1, see the figure. We can fill this row with tokens from left to right. To do this, we will place the tokens in sequence, as shown in the figure. The numbers in circles indicate the sequence of placing the tokens. A crossed-out number means removing a token when placing an adjacent one. When filling the bottom row, each subsequent token removes the previous one from the board, so placing a token with an odd number in the row A1-H1 removes the previous even-numbered token from the row A2-H2. To place a token on the H1 field, we first need to place token number 14 on the H3 field, then token number 15 on the H2 field, removing the previous one. Finally, we can place token number 16 on the corner field H1, removing token number 15 from the board.Next, we can fill all the horizontal rows up to A6-H6 in a similar manner. Rows A7-F7 and A8-F8 will have to be filled differently, as there are not enough free squares above them. The order of filling the two vertical squares A7 and A8 is shown in the second figure. To fill them, we need to start twice from the C8 field. This way, we will reach the F7 and F8 fields. We cannot move further to the right, as there is no free field except for the H8 field. We can place a token on this field and, if we wish to fill the G8 field, remove the token from the H8 field. Thus, we have shown how to fill the board with 61 tokens.

Suppose 61 tokens are placed on the board. The three free squares do not allow us to select one that does not have any adjacent occupied squares. The minimum number of sides of a free square that can adjoin another free square is two, in the corner of the board.

The function (x - 1)^2 - 6 is a parabola opening upwards, which has a minimum value at x = 1 and is equal to -6.Since ln x is always increasing and the parabola has only one minimum, the graph of ln x will intersect the graph of (x - 1)^2 - 6 at two points.

Tangent and Normal to a Plane Curve. Angle Between Two CurvesIf a plane curve is referred to a rectangular coordinate system (Fig. 33), then the equations of the tangent and normal to it at the point Mleft(x_{0}, y_{0}right) are:y-y_{0}=y_{0}^{prime}left(x-x_{0}right) ; quad y-y_{0}=-frac{1}{y_{0}^{prime}}left(x-x_{0}right)where y_{0}^{prime} is the value at the point x_{0} of the derivative frac{d y}{d x} from the equation of the curve.The direction of the curve at each of its points is determined by the direction of the tangent to it at that point. The angle between two intersecting curves is defined as the angle between two lines tangent to the curves at their point of intersection (Fig. 34) by the formulaoperatorname{tg} varphi=frac{k_{1}-k_{2}}{1+k_{1} k_{2}}where k_{1} and k_{2} are the slopes of the tangents to the curves at their point of intersection Pleft(x_{0}, y_{0}right), i.e., the particular values at the point x_{0} of the derivatives of y with respect to x from the equations of these curves:k_{1}=operatorname{tg} alpha_{1}=left(frac{d y_{1}}{d x}right)_{x=x_{0}} ; k_{2}=operatorname{tg} alpha_{2}=left(frac{d y_{2}}{d x}right)_{x=x_{0}}![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_05_22_8a069bcd8684ea7ea3dbg-080.jpg?height=223&width=347&top_left_y=215&top_left_x=192)Fig. : 3![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_05_22_8a069bcd8684ea7ea3dbg-080.jpg?height=210&width=315&top_left_y=225&top_left_x=763)Fig. 34"},{"problem":"## Task A-4.1.Determine all complex numbers z for which z^{2}=(1+i) cdot bar{z}.","solution":"## First Solution.Let z=x+i y, where x and y are real numbers.

Denote the incircle of triangle ABC as w = C(r), where r is the inradius. Let the points where the incircle touches the sides BC, CA, and AB be D, E, and F respectively.2. Consider the tangents to the incircle that are parallel to the sides of triangle ABC. These tangents form three smaller triangles, each sharing one vertex with triangle ABC. For instance, let M in AB and N in AC such that MN parallel BC and MN is tangent to w.3. Denote the incircle of triangle AMN as w_1 = C(r_1) and its semiperimeter as p_1. Since triangle AMN sim triangle ABC, we have p_1 = p - a, where p is the semiperimeter of triangle ABC.4. The similarity ratio between triangle AMN and triangle ABC gives frac{r_1}{r} = frac{p_1}{p}. Therefore, r_1 = frac{r(p - a)}{p}.5. The area of the incircle of triangle ABC is pi r^2. The area of the incircle of triangle AMN is pi r_1^2 = pi left(frac{r(p - a)}{p}right)^2 = pi frac{r^2 (p - a)^2}{p^2}.6. Similarly, for the other two smaller triangles, we have r_2 = frac{r(p - b)}{p} and r_3 = frac{r(p - c)}{p}, and their areas are pi r_2^2 = pi frac{r^2 (p - b)^2}{p^2} and pi r_3^2 = pi frac{r^2 (p - c)^2}{p^2}.7. Summing the areas of the incircles of the three smaller triangles and the incircle of triangle ABC, we get:   [   pi r^2 + pi r_1^2 + pi r_2^2 + pi r_3^2 = pi r^2 + pi frac{r^2 (p - a)^2}{p^2} + pi frac{r^2 (p - b)^2}{p^2} + pi frac{r^2 (p - c)^2}{p^2}   ]   [   = pi r^2 left(1 + frac{(p - a)^2 + (p - b)^2 + (p - c)^2}{p^2}right)   ]8.

Since r = frac{A}{p}, where A is the area of triangle ABC, we have r^2 = frac{A^2}{p^2}.

What are its digits?(Paolo Leonetti)","solution":"1. Let ( n ) be the positive integer with 7 distinct digits, and let ( S ) be the set of its digits. Since ( n ) is a positive integer, ( 0 notin S ) because no positive integer can be a multiple of ( 0 ).2. Note that ( S ) must contain an even number. If ( S ) did not contain an even number, it would have at most five elements (1, 3, 5, 7, 9), which is less than 7. Therefore, ( S ) must contain at least one even number.3. Since ( S ) must contain an even number, ( 5 notin S ). If ( 5 ) were in ( S ), ( n ) would be a multiple of both ( 5 ) and some even number, which would make ( n ) end in ( 0 ). This is not possible because ( 0 notin S ).4. Consider the sum of the digits in ( S ). If ( 9 ) were not in ( S ), the sum of the digits would be:   [   1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 6 + 7 + 8 = 31   ]   Since 31 is not a multiple of 9, ( n ) would not be divisible by 9, which contradicts the requirement that ( n ) is a multiple of each of its digits. Therefore, ( 9 in S ).5. Since ( 9 in S ), the sum of the digits in ( S ) must be a multiple of 9. The sum of all digits from 1 to 9 is:   [   1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8 + 9 = 45   ]   To make the sum of the digits in ( S ) a multiple of 9, we need to exclude one digit such that the remaining sum is still a multiple of 9. We need to exclude a digit such that the sum of the remaining digits is 36 (since 45 - 36 = 9, which is a multiple of 9).6. Excluding 4 from the set of digits gives:   [   1 + 2 + 3 + 6 + 7 + 8 + 9 = 36   ]   Since 36 is a multiple of 9, the set ( S ) must be:   [   S = {1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 8, 9}   ]The final answer is ( boxed{ {1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 8, 9} } )"},{"problem":"7.

There are 100 colors available.2. Initial Observations:   - Each color must appear at least once.   - If a color appears only once, it must be positioned such that it satisfies the condition for all other colors.3. Analyzing the Constraints:   - If a color ( c_1 ) appears only once, it must be to the left of every other color ( c_2, c_3, ldots, c_{100} ).   - However, if another color ( c_2 ) also appears only once, it must be to the left of ( c_1 ) to satisfy the condition for ( c_2 ) and ( c_1 ).

Factor the difference of squares:   [   315^2 - n^2 = (315 + n)(315 - n)   ]2. Factor the difference of cubes:   [   315^3 - n^3 = (315 - n)(315^2 + 315n + n^2)   ]3. Determine the divisibility condition:   For ( 315^2 - n^2 ) to divide ( 315^3 - n^3 ), the expression ( (315 + n)(315 - n) ) must divide ( (315 - n)(315^2 + 315n + n^2) ).4. Simplify the divisibility condition:   Since ( 315 - n ) is a common factor, we need ( 315 + n ) to divide ( 315^2 + 315n + n^2 ):   [   315 + n mid 315^2 + 315n + n^2   ]5. Evaluate the divisibility:   We need to check when ( 315 + n ) divides ( 315^2 ):   [   315 + n mid 315^2   ]6. Find the smallest ( n ):   We need to find the smallest positive integer ( n ) such that ( 315 + n ) is a divisor of ( 315^2 ). The prime factorization of ( 315 ) is:   [   315 = 3 times 3 times 5 times 7 = 3^2 times 5 times 7   ]   Therefore, the prime factorization of ( 315^2 ) is:   [   315^2 = (3^2 times 5 times 7)^2 = 3^4 times 5^2 times 7^2   ]   The divisors of ( 315^2 ) are all the products of the form ( 3^a times 5^b times 7^c ) where ( 0 leq a leq 4 ), ( 0 leq b leq 2 ), and ( 0 leq c leq 2 ).7. Check the smallest ( n ):   We need to find the smallest ( n ) such that ( 315 + n ) is one of these divisors. The smallest divisor greater than 315 is:   [   315 + 1 = 316   ]   However, 316 is not a divisor of ( 315^2 ). The next smallest divisor is:   [   315 + 5 = 320   ]   Again, 320 is not a divisor of ( 315^2 ). Continuing this process, we find:   [   315 + 45 = 360   ]   360 is not a divisor of ( 315^2 ). Finally, we find:   [   315 + 90 = 405   ]   405 is a divisor of ( 315^2 ) because:   [   405 = 3^4 times 5   ]Thus, the smallest positive integer ( n ) for which ( 315^2 - n^2 ) evenly divides ( 315^3 - n^3 ) is ( n = 90 ).The final answer is ( boxed{90} )"},{"problem":"The graphs of the functions y=k x+b and y=b x+k intersect.

We draw the perpendicular bisectors of the segments determined by them. In how many points can these lines intersect at most?","solution":"In the intersection points that arise, the perpendicular bisectors of segments whose endpoints form either a triangle or a quadrilateral intersect. Since the perpendicular bisectors of the sides of a triangle intersect at a single point, we get one intersection point per triangle. For each quadrilateral, up to 3 intersection points can arise, as we can choose pairs of non-adjacent sides from the 6 segments connecting the vertices of a quadrilateral in 3 different ways. The number of intersection points thus arising is at most binom{n}{3} + 3binom{n}{4} for n points, which is 750 for n=10.We will show that this upper bound is achievable for every n. For this, it is necessary that the possible binom{n}{3} triangles and binom{n}{4} quadrilaterals are formed, and that no intersection point is counted more than once in the above calculation. One might think that by placing the points in a \\"general position,\\" the circumcenters of the triangles do not coincide with other intersection points; however, this must be proven, which we do by induction on the number of points.For three points placed at the vertices of a triangle, we clearly get a suitable set of points. Now let n > 3 and suppose we have already successfully placed the points P_{1}, P_{2}, ldots, P_{n-1}. Denote the perpendicular bisector of the segment P_{i} P_{j} by f_{i j}. The new point P_{n} must be chosen such that:a) the new f_{n i} lines intersect every new f_{n j} and every old f_{i j} line;b) the new perpendicular bisectors do not pass through any old intersection points (Figure 1);1986-10-310-1.epsFigure 1c) the intersection point of the new perpendicular bisectors does not lie on any old perpendicular bisector (Figure 2), except for the circumcenter of the new P_{n} P_{i} P_{j} triangles (so in the figure, f is not the same as f_{i j});# 1986-10-310-2.epsFigure 2d) no three new perpendicular bisectors pass through the same point (Figure 3).1986-10-310-3.epsFigure 3The perpendicular bisectors of given segments intersect if and only if the segments are not parallel. Therefore, P_{n} cannot lie on the lines connecting any two previous points (so that the new perpendicular bisectors intersect each other) or on lines parallel to the lines connecting two previous points and passing through a previous point (so that the new perpendicular bisectors intersect the old ones). If P_{n} is chosen outside these finitely many lines, then all necessary intersection points will be formed.If Q is an old intersection point (Figure 1), then f_{n i} passes through Q if and only if P_{n} lies on the circle centered at Q with radius Q P_{i}. There are only finitely many such circles, so P_{n} can be chosen so that it does not lie on any of these circles or on the previously excluded lines.Finally, we claim that with this choice of P_{n}, neither the situation in Figure 2 nor the situation in Figure 3 can occur. In Figure 2, the new f_{n i} and f_{n j} lines intersect at Q, and the old f_{i j} also passes through Q, so Q is the intersection of two old perpendicular bisectors, f_{i j} and f. By the choice of P_{n}, no new perpendicular bisector passes through such a point. The point Q in Figure 3, being the circumcenter of the old P_{i} P_{j} P_{k} triangle, is also the intersection of old perpendicular bisectors and thus cannot lie on a new perpendicular bisector.We have thus shown that the above choice of P_{n} is suitable, and this completes the proof.Therefore, it is possible to place 10 points in the plane such that all 750 intersection points arise.Remark. Most solutions only contained the initial calculation, and generally lacked the proof that the given bound is indeed achievable. Many were satisfied with ensuring that no three of the given points are collinear and no four lie on a circle. This is insufficient, as it is still possible to choose 3 segments such that their perpendicular bisectors intersect at a single point."},{"problem":"In triangle △ABC, if ∠A = 60° and a= sqrt{3}, then the value of frac{a+b}{sin A+sin B} is __________.","solution":"Given that ∠A = 60° and a= sqrt{3}, we apply the law of sines to find the ratio frac{a}{sin A}.Step 1: Compute sin A knowing that ∠A = 60°.

The expression frac{a+b}{sin A+sin B} suggests that we are essentially adding a term related to side b and sin B. To maintain equivalence, the addition of b to a in the numerator must be balanced by the addition of sin B to sin A in the denominator, thus leaving our ratio unchanged.Step 4: Therefore, by the proportionality and the law of sines, we get: frac{a+b}{sin A+sin B} = frac{a}{sin A} = boxed{2}.

Let's set the equation of the ellipse as  frac {x^{2}}{2b^{2}}+ frac {y^{2}}{b^{2}}=1.  The equation can be rewritten as x^{2}+2y^{2}-2b^{2}=0. Substituting the line equation l, we have the system:begin{cases} x^2 + 2y^2 = 2b^2 y = -x + 3 end{cases}.Combining these two equations gives us 3x^2 - 12x + 18 - 2b^2 = 0.  By setting the discriminant to zero Delta = 12^2 - 12(18 - 2b^2) = 0, we find that b^2 = 3.  Therefore, the equation of ellipse E is frac{x^2}{6} + frac{y^2}{3} = 1.

By substituting the equations of l and l', we find that P(2 - frac{2}{3}m, 1 + frac{2}{3}m), thus |PT|^2 = frac{8}{9}m^2.  From the system of equations:begin{cases}y = frac{1}{2}x + m frac{x^2}{6} + frac{y^2}{3} = 1end{cases}, we get 3x^2 + 4mx + (4m^2 - 12) = 0.  The discriminant must be positive for two intersections: Delta = 16(9 - 2m^2) > 0.  Thus x_1 + x_2 = -frac{4}{3}m and x_1x_2 = frac{4m^2 - 12}{3}.  |PA| = sqrt{1 + (frac{1}{2})^2}|2 - frac{2m}{3} - x_1| = frac{sqrt{5}}{2}|2 - frac{2m}{3} - x_1|,  and similarly, |PB| = frac{sqrt{5}}{2}|2 - frac{2m}{3} - x_2|.

According to the problem, the hundreds digit a must be triple the ones digit c. Therefore, we have the relationship a = 3c.3. Since a is a digit in the hundreds place of a 3-digit number, it must be between 1 and 9. Similarly, c must be a digit between 0 and 9.4. We need to find the valid values of c such that a = 3c is also a valid digit (i.e., between 1 and 9). 5.

Thus, ( f(1) = 1 ).   - For ( n = 2 ), the only way to express 2 as a sum of positive odd integers is ( 1 + 1 ). Thus, ( f(2) = 1 ).3. Recursive relation:   - Consider the first number in the sum. It can be any positive odd integer less than or equal to ( n ). Let the first number be ( k ), where ( k ) is an odd integer.   - If the first number is ( k ), then the remaining sum is ( n - k ).

Who can win regardless of how the opponent plays?## SolutionChekalin's winning strategy is to flip the same card (for example, the Queen of Spades) every time. All possible positions can be divided into pairs that differ only by the position of the Queen of Spades. If, in response to Chekalin's move, Germann also flips the Queen of Spades, the previous position will repeat, and he will lose. Therefore, he is forced to flip another card.

How many rounds did the competition include? How many medals were awarded in total?(2) Divide a circle into n different sectors (n geqslant 2), denoted as S_{1}, S_{2}, cdots, S_{n}. Each sector can be painted with any of three colors: red, blue, or white, with the requirement that adjacent sectors must have different colors. How many ways are there to paint the sectors?","solution":"Analysis: For the 1st question, the number of medals awarded in each round follows a certain pattern, so we can establish a relationship for the number of medals awarded in each round or the number of medals remaining after each round; For the 2nd question, we need to establish a recursive relationship for the total number of coloring methods and find the initial value, thereby obtaining the total number of coloring methods.Solution (1) Let the number of medals remaining after k rounds of the competition be a_{k}. Since the number of medals awarded in the kth round is k + frac{1}{7}(a_{n-1} - k), we have a_{k} = a_{k-1} - left[k + frac{1}{7}(a_{k-1} - k)right], which simplifies to a_{k} = frac{6}{7} a_{k-1} - frac{6}{7} k with a_{0} = m, a_{n} = 0. Further transformation gives a_{k} + 6k - 36 = frac{6}{7}[a_{k-1} + 6(k-1) - 36], thus a_{n} + 6n - 36 = (a_{0} - 36)left(frac{6}{7}right)^{n} = (m - 36)left(frac{6}{7}right)^{n}, which means a_{n} = (m - 36)left(frac{6}{7}right)^{n} - (6n - 36). Since a_{n} = 0, we have (m - 36) = (n - 6) frac{7^{n}}{6^{n-1}}. Given that n - 6 < 6^{n-1} and 7^{n} and 6^{n-1} are coprime, and m, n in mathbf{N}_{+}, we conclude n = 6, m = 36. Therefore, the competition consists of 6 rounds, and a total of 36 medals are awarded.(2) Let the total number of coloring methods be a_{n} (n geqslant 2). When n = 2, first color S_{1}, which has 3 coloring methods, and then S_{2} has 2 coloring methods, so a_{2} = 6. When n geqslant 3, S_{1} has 3 coloring methods, S_{2} has 2 coloring methods, S_{3} has 2 coloring methods, ..., S_{n-1} has 2 coloring methods, and S_{n} still has 2 coloring methods (regardless of whether S_{n} is the same color as S_{1}), thus there are 3 times 2^{n-1} coloring methods. However, these 3 times 2^{n-1} coloring methods can be divided into two categories: one where S_{n} is the same color as S_{1}, in which case S_{n} and S_{1} are considered as one sector, and there are a_{n-1} coloring methods; the other where S_{n} is a different color from S_{1}, in which case there are a_{n} coloring methods, so we have a_{n} + a_{n-1} = 3 times 2^{n-1} (n geqslant 3). Let p_{n} = frac{a_{n}}{2^{n}}, then 2 p_{n} + p_{n-1} = 3 (n geqslant 3), thus p_{n} - 1 = -frac{1}{2}(p_{n-1} - 1) (n geqslant 3), p_{2} = frac{a_{2}}{2^{2}}, so p_{n} - 1 = left(-frac{1}{2}right)^{n-2}(p_{2} - 1) = -left(-frac{1}{2}right)^{n-1}. Therefore, p_{n} = 1 - left(-frac{1}{2}right)^{n-1}, and we get a_{n} = 2^{n} p_{n} = 2^{n} + (-1)^{n} cdot 2 (n geqslant 3). But when n = 2, the formula also holds, so we have a_{n} = 2^{n} + (-1)^{n} cdot 2 (n geqslant 2).

The formula for the arc length of a sector is given by frac{theta}{360} cdot 2pi r, where theta is the central angle in degrees and r is the radius of the circle.

Substitution shows that x_{1}, x_{2}, x_{3}, x_{4}, x_{5} all satisfy (1).Since a fifth-degree equation can have at most 5 distinct roots, the solution is complete.Ámon Magdolna (Győr, Zrínyi I. lg. III. o. t.)II. solution. It is sufficient to deal with equation (2) from the first solution. Since all the coefficients of this equation are integers, we can find its rational roots, if any, by a finite number of substitution trials. It is well known that a rational root of an equation with integer coefficients, in its simplest form, must have a numerator that is a divisor of the constant term and a denominator that is a divisor of the coefficient of the highest power of the variable. In (2), both this coefficient and the constant term are 6, so only 1, 2, 3, and 6, as well as their negatives, can be the numerator and denominator, respectively. Therefore, (2) can only be satisfied by the following rational numbers:[pm 1, pm 2, pm 3, pm 6, pm frac{1}{2}, pm frac{3}{2}, pm frac{1}{3}, pm frac{2}{3}, pm frac{1}{6}]Among these, the value of the left side is 0 for x_{2}=2 and x_{3}=-3, so the remaining two roots are their reciprocals: x_{4}=1 / 2, x_{5}=-1 / 3.Farkas Zoltán (Hódmezővásárhely, Bethlen G. g.

If we do not know the property of reciprocal equations used here, we can find the remaining two roots either by further trial and error or by determining them as the roots of the equation that results from dividing (2) by the product of the factors corresponding to the roots we have found, (x-2)(x+3).[^0][^0]:    { }^{1} See K.

Substituting C(0,1) into frac{x^2}{a^2} + frac{y^2}{b^2} = 1, we get frac{0}{a^2} + frac{1}{b^2} = 1. This simplifies to b^2 = 1, so b = 1 because b > 0.2. The eccentricity e = frac{c}{a} = frac{sqrt{2}}{2}. Since e = frac{sqrt{a^2 - b^2}}{a}, we can substitute b = 1 into this equation to find a and c:   - e = frac{sqrt{a^2 - 1}}{a} = frac{sqrt{2}}{2}   - Squaring both sides gives frac{a^2 - 1}{a^2} = frac{1}{2}   - Solving for a^2 gives a^2 = 2, so a = sqrt{2}   - Since e = frac{c}{a}, we find c = e cdot a = frac{sqrt{2}}{2} cdot sqrt{2} = 1Therefore, the equation of the ellipse is boxed{frac{x^2}{2} + y^2 = 1}.

Rewrite the equation of the circle in the standard form to find its center and radius. The given equation is x^{2}+y^{2}+2x+2y-2=0. Completing the squares, we get:   [   (x+1)^{2} - 1 + (y+1)^{2} - 1 - 2 = 0 implies (x+1)^{2} + (y+1)^{2} = 4   ]   Therefore, the center of the circle C is (-1,-1) and the radius r=2.2.

Therefore, the equation of line l in this case is 3x+4y+2=0.4.

Suppose that for all m times m sub-tables from the table (m > 1), the number of black squares is not more than white squares. Find the maximum number of black squares.","solution":"1. Understanding the Problem:   We need to find the maximum number of black squares in an ( n times n ) table such that for any ( m times m ) sub-table (where ( m > 1 )), the number of black squares is not more than the number of white squares. Given that ( n ) is divisible by 3, we can write ( n = 3k ) for some integer ( k ).2. Construction of the Table:   We color the cells with coordinates ((a, b)) black if and only if ((a, b)) are ((1,2), (2,1), (3,2), (2,3)) modulo 3. This means:   - A cell ((a, b)) is black if ( a equiv 1 pmod{3} ) and ( b equiv 2 pmod{3} )   - A cell ((a, b)) is black if ( a equiv 2 pmod{3} ) and ( b equiv 1 pmod{3} )   - A cell ((a, b)) is black if ( a equiv 3 pmod{3} ) and ( b equiv 2 pmod{3} )   - A cell ((a, b)) is black if ( a equiv 2 pmod{3} ) and ( b equiv 3 pmod{3} )3. Counting the Black Squares:   Each ( 3 times 3 ) block in the table will have exactly 4 black squares. Since the table is ( n times n ) and ( n = 3k ), there are ( k^2 ) such ( 3 times 3 ) blocks in the table. Therefore, the total number of black squares is:   [   4 times k^2 = 4 times left(frac{n}{3}right)^2 = frac{4n^2}{9}   ]4. Verification:   We need to verify that any ( m times m ) sub-table (where ( m > 1 )) has at most half of its cells black. Consider any ( 2 times m ) or ( 3 times m ) rectangle:   - For ( 2 times m ) rectangles, since ( m ) can be written as ( 2a + 3b ) for non-negative integers ( a ) and ( b ), the number of black squares will be at most half of the total cells.   - For ( 3 times m ) rectangles, the same logic applies, ensuring that the number of black squares is at most half of the total cells.

Since Delta =b^{2}+8a > 0, we havex_{2}= frac{-b+sqrt{b^{2}+8a}}{4a} and x_{1}= frac{-b-sqrt{b^{2}+8a}}{4a}.Clearly, x_{1}  0,so on the interval (0, frac{-b+sqrt{b^{2}+8a}}{4a}), the derivative is less than 0, and the function is decreasing; on the interval (frac{-b+sqrt{b^{2}+8a}}{4a},+infty), the derivative is greater than 0, and the function is increasing.In summary, when a=0 and bleqslant 0, the function is monotonically decreasing on (0,+infty); when a=0 and b > 0, the function is monotonically decreasing on (0, frac{1}{b}) and monotonically increasing on (frac{1}{b},+infty); when a > 0, the function is monotonically decreasing on (0, frac{-b+sqrt{b^{2}+8a}}{4a}) and monotonically increasing on (frac{-b+sqrt{b^{2}+8a}}{4a},+infty).(II) According to the problem, the function f(x) attains its minimum value at x=1,from (I), we know that frac{-b+sqrt{b^{2}+8a}}{4a} is the unique point of local minimum, thus frac{-b+sqrt{b^{2}+8a}}{4a}=1.Rearranging gives 2a+b=1, i.e., b=1-2a.Let g(x)=2-4x+ln x, then g'(x)=frac{1-4x}{x}.Setting g'(x)=frac{1-4x}{x}=0 yields x=frac{1}{4}.When 0  0, the function is monotonically increasing; when frac{1}{4} < x < +infty, g'(x) < 0, the function is monotonically decreasing.Since g(x)leqslant g(frac{1}{4})=1-ln 4 < 0,thus g(a) < 0, i.e., 2-4a+ln a=2b+ln a < 0, which means ln a < -2b.

For the fraction to be positive, since a > 0, the denominator (1-a) must be negative, which means that a < 1. Therefore, for b to be positive, the numerator (a^2 - 3a) should also be negative, this gives us the range 1 < a < 3. Now, we consider the expression we want to minimize:begin{align*}2a + b &= 2a + frac{a^2 - 3a}{1 - a}&= frac{2a(1 - a) + a^2 - 3a}{1 - a}&= frac{-a^2 + a + 2a}{1 - a}&= frac{-a^2 + 3a}{1 - a}&= a - 1 + frac{2}{1 - a} + 3&= a - 1 + frac{2}{a - 1} + 3.end{align*}Using the AM-GM inequality (Arithmetic Mean - Geometric Mean inequality), we can assert that for any positive numbers x and y: frac{x + y}{2} geq sqrt{xy}, with equality if and only if x = y.Applying this inequality to the terms a - 1 and frac{2}{a - 1}, we have:begin{align*}a - 1 + frac{2}{a - 1} &geq 2sqrt{(a - 1) cdot frac{2}{a - 1}} &= 2sqrt{2},end{align*}with equality if and only if a - 1 = frac{2}{a - 1}.Solving this equation, we get a - 1 = sqrt{2} Rightarrow a = 1 + sqrt{2}.So the minimum value of 2a + b is 2sqrt{2} + 3 and occurs when a = 1 + sqrt{2} and thus b = 1.Therefore, the minimum value of 2a + b is boxed{2sqrt{2} + 3}.

Analyze the line passing through ( P ):   - Let ( P = (x_1, y_1) ).   - The equation of the line through ( P ) with slope (frac{1}{2}) is ( y - y_1 = frac{1}{2}(x - x_1) ), which simplifies to ( y = frac{1}{2}x + b ) where ( b = y_1 - frac{1}{2}x_1 ).4. Condition for the line to pass through both squares:   - The line must intersect the vertical line ( x = 1 ) within the interval ( 0 leq y leq 1 ).   - Substitute ( x = 1 ) into the line equation: ( y = frac{1}{2}(1) + b = frac{1}{2} + b ).   - For the line to intersect within the interval ( 0 leq y leq 1 ), we need ( 0 leq frac{1}{2} + b leq 1 ).5.

Calculate the probability:   - The probability that ( b ) falls within the desired range is the length of the desired range divided by the total range: (frac{frac{1}{2}}{1} = frac{1}{2}).8. Combine probabilities for both squares:   - If ( P ) is in the right square, the line will always pass through both squares.   - If ( P ) is in the left square, the probability is (frac{1}{2}).   - The total probability is the sum of the probabilities for each case, weighted by the probability of ( P ) being in each square:     [     frac{1}{2} cdot 1 + frac{1}{2} cdot frac{1}{2} = frac{1}{2} + frac{1}{4} = frac{3}{4}.     ]The final answer is (boxed{frac{3}{4}})."},{"problem":"For real numbers a and b, define the operation \\"*\\" as follows: a*b= begin{cases} a^{2}-ab & text{if } aleq b  b^{2}-ab & text{if } a>b end{cases} Let f(x) = (2x-1)*(x-1), and suppose the equation f(x)=m (m in mathbb{R}) has exactly three distinct real roots x_1, x_2, x_3.

However, the total score of s participating teams is 2 C_{s}^{2} = s(s-1) points, leading to a contradiction.Thus, m geqslant 4, n geqslant 1, meaning the winning team A must play at least 5 matches, which implies there should be no fewer than 6 teams in the competition.We can construct a match points table, which includes six teams A, B, C, D, E, F, and meets the requirements of the problem: the winning team A wins the fewest matches but has the highest score.In summary, there must be at least 6 teams participating."},{"problem":"3.

Therefore, choosing either AC or BD first does not ensure victory.3.

Each class contains k! permutations with the same element a_{i} as the first element. The last factor in these permutations is always Sleft(=a_{1}+right. left.a_{2}+cdots+a_{k+1}right), and the first k factors are all possible permutations of the remaining k elements.

The period is given by T = frac{2pi}{omega}, so we have pi = frac{2pi}{omega}. Solving for omega, we obtain omega = 2. Therefore, the explicit formula for f(x) isf(x) = 2sin(2x + frac{pi}{3}).(2) For the function to be monotonically increasing, the argument of the sine function must be in the interval left[2kpi - frac{pi}{2}, 2kpi + frac{pi}{2}right] for k in mathbb{Z}.

How many points are there in the plane that, when reflected successively over the lines A B, B C, C D and D A, finally return to their original position?","solution":"It is known that the successive reflection over two lines is either a rotation or a translation. If the lines e and f intersect at point M and the angle between them is alpha, then the 2alpha-degree rotation about M is equivalent to the successive reflections over e and f (Figure 1); if the two lines are parallel and the distance between them is d, then the result of the successive reflections over the lines is a translation perpendicular to the lines, with a distance of 2d (Figure 2). The direction of the rotation or translation depends on which of the lines e and f is reflected over first.Therefore, the reflections over AB and then BC can be replaced by a 2angle ABC-degree rotation about B, and the reflections over CD and then DA can be replaced by a 2angle CDA-degree rotation about D. These rotations can be replaced by two successive reflections over axes, and we can assume that one of the axes is the line BD in both cases. Let g be the line through B and h be the line through D, such that the successive reflections over g and BD, and over BD and h are equivalent to the 2angle ABC-degree rotation about B and the 2angle CDA-degree rotation about D, respectively. The lines g and h can be constructed simply by considering the angle equalities shown in Figure 3. Thus, the successive reflections over the four sides of the quadrilateral ABCD can be replaced by the successive reflections over g, BD, BD again, and h. However, this is the same as reflecting over g and then h, because reflecting over the same line twice in succession is the identity transformation. Therefore, our problem is reduced to finding how many fixed points the successive reflections over g and h have.The successive reflections over two lines are a translation if g parallel h. This happens precisely when angle ABC + angle CDA = 180^circ (Figure 4), which means that ABCD is a cyclic quadrilateral. A (non-identity) translation has no fixed points, so in this case, there is no point in the plane that returns to its original position after the transformations. If g and h intersect at point P (Figure 3), then the transformation is a rotation about P by an angle less than 360^circ, which has P as its only fixed point.In summary, there is either no point or exactly one point in the plane that returns to its original position after the successive reflections over the lines AB, BC, CD, and DA, depending on whether ABCD is a cyclic quadrilateral or not.![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_05_02_2b6f0b1c8db572ba6271g-1.jpg?height=1278&width=610&top_left_y=1072&top_left_x=736)![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_05_02_2b6f0b1c8db572ba6271g-2.jpg?height=1340&width=686&top_left_y=159&top_left_x=709)"},{"problem":"Example 1 Let the quadratic function f(x) satisfyf(x+2)=f(-x+2)and its graph intersects the y-axis at the point (0,1), and the segment it intercepts on the x-axis is 2 sqrt{2}.

Therefore, we can use the zero-product form to solve.Let f(x)=a(x-2+sqrt{2})(x-2-sqrt{2}).Since the graph of the quadratic function passes through the point (0,1), substituting into the undetermined form gives a=frac{1}{2}.

Recognize that 4 can be written as 2^2. This gives us the inequality 2^{x^2-x} < 2^2.2. Given that the function y = 2^x is monotonically increasing (meaning it never decreases as x increases), we can compare the exponents directly when the bases are the same and the inequality direction remains unchanged. Therefore, from 2^{x^2-x} < 2^2, we deduce that x^2 - x < 2.3. Rearrange the inequality to standard quadratic form: x^2 - x - 2 < 0.4. Factor the quadratic expression: (x-2)(x+1) < 0.5. Solve the inequality (x-2)(x+1) < 0. The critical points, where the expression changes sign, are at x = 2 and x = -1. Testing intervals around these points, we find that the expression is negative (and thus the original inequality is satisfied) when x is between -1 and 2.Therefore, the solution set of the inequality 2^{x^2-x} < 4 is x in (-1, 2).

It is known that after selling all the pure milk and yogurt, a total profit of 2150 yuan was made. Find the number of boxes of yogurt sold at a 10% discount.","solution":" Step-by-Step Solution# Part (1): Finding the Quantity of Pure MilkLet's denote the number of boxes of pure milk purchased as x. Given that the quantity of yogurt is 1.5 times the quantity of pure milk, the number of boxes of yogurt purchased can be represented as 1.5x.Given the price difference and the total cost for each, we can set up an equation to find the cost per box for each type of milk. The price of each box of yogurt is 30 yuan more expensive than each box of pure milk. Therefore, we can express the cost per box of pure milk as frac{2000}{x} and the cost per box of yogurt as frac{4800}{1.5x}. The difference between these costs is 30 yuan, leading to the equation:[frac{4800}{1.5x} - frac{2000}{x} = 30]Solving this equation for x:[x = 40]After verifying, x=40 is indeed a solution that satisfies the conditions of the problem.Therefore, the quantity of pure milk purchased this time is boxed{40 text{ boxes}}.# Part (2): Finding the Number of Boxes of Yogurt Sold at a 10% DiscountFirst, we calculate the cost price of each box of pure milk and yogurt. The cost price of each box of pure milk is frac{2000}{40} = 50 yuan, and the cost price of each box of yogurt is frac{4800}{1.5 times 40} = 80 yuan.Let y represent the number of boxes of yogurt sold at a 10% discount. The total revenue from selling all the pure milk and yogurt, including the markup and discount, can be calculated as follows:- Revenue from selling pure milk: 80 times 40- Revenue from selling yogurt at a 25% markup (excluding the y boxes sold at a discount): 80 times (1+25%) times (1.5 times 40 - y)- Revenue from selling y boxes of yogurt at a 10% discount after a 25% markup: 80 times (1+25%) times 0.9yThe total profit made, given as 2150 yuan, is the difference between the total revenue and the total cost (2000 + 4800 yuan). Therefore, we have the equation:[80 times 40 + 80 times (1+25%)(1.5 times 40 - y) + 80 times (1+25%) times 0.9y - 2000 - 4800 = 2150]Solving this equation for y gives:[y = 25]Thus, the number of boxes of yogurt sold at a 10% discount is boxed{25 text{ boxes}}."},{"problem":"In the diagram, P Q R S is a rectangle with P Q=5 and Q R=3 . quad P R is divided into three segments of equal length by points T and U.

We start with the given information: log_{10} 2 approx 0.30103.2. We need to find the smallest positive integer n such that the decimal representation of 2^{10n} does not begin with the digit 1.3. Consider the expression log_{10} (2^{10n}). Using the properties of logarithms, we have:   [   log_{10} (2^{10n}) = 10n log_{10} 2   ]4. Substituting the given value of log_{10} 2, we get:   [   10n log_{10} 2 approx 10n times 0.30103 = 3.0103n   ]5. For 2^{10n} to not begin with the digit 1, the fractional part of 3.0103n must be greater than log_{10} 2 approx 0.30103. This is because if the fractional part is less than log_{10} 2, then 2^{10n} will begin with 1.6. Therefore, we need:   [   {3.0103n} > 0.30103   ]   where {x} denotes the fractional part of x.7.

How many children have a left neighbor wearing a jacket of the same color?","solution":"Answer: 126.Solution I. Let each of the children say whether the color of their jacket is the same as that of the child to their left. We need to find out how many children will say \\"The same.\\"Let's find out how many children said \\"Different.\\" Note that if we go around the circle, the jacket colors of such children alternate. Indeed, if someone has a red jacket and their left neighbor has a blue one, then further on, there are several (possibly one) children in blue jackets until someone says that their left neighbor has a red jacket. Similarly, if someone has a blue jacket and their left neighbor has a red one. Therefore, among the children who said \\"Different,\\" there are an equal number of children in red and blue jackets. According to the problem, there are 12 children in red jackets. Thus, the total number of children who said \\"Different\\" is twice as many, i.e., 24. Therefore, the answer is 150 - 2 cdot 12 = 126.Solution II. We know that 12 children in blue jackets have a neighbor to their left dressed in a red jacket. This means that in the circle, there are 12 pairs of adjacent children, where the right one is in a red jacket and the left one is in a blue jacket. We will denote such pairs as BK. What do we need to find? We need to find the number of pairs of adjacent children whose jackets are of the same color, i.e., pairs RR and BB.The main observation for this solution is as follows: the total number of pairs BK and BB equals simply the number of children in blue jackets, since each of them has some neighbor to their right. If this neighbor is in a red jacket, we count them in pairs BK, and if they are in a blue jacket, we count them in pairs BB. So, let the total number of children in blue jackets be s. There are 12 pairs BK, so there are s - 12 pairs BB.Similarly, the total number of pairs BK and RR equals the number of children in red jackets. The number of children in red jackets is 150 - s, and there are 12 pairs BK, so there are 138 - s pairs RR. Therefore, the total number of pairs BB and RR is (s - 12) + (138 - s) = 126."},{"problem":"In a triangle, the lengths of the three sides are 4, x, and 12-x.(1) The range of values for x is ______;(2) If this is an isosceles triangle, then the perimeter of the isosceles triangle is ______.","solution":"To solve the given problem, we proceed as follows:Part (1): Finding the range of values for xGiven the sides of the triangle are 4, x, and 12-x, we apply the triangle inequality theorem which states that the sum of the lengths of any two sides of a triangle must be greater than the length of the remaining side. This gives us three inequalities:1. 4 + x > 12 - x2. 4 + (12 - x) > x3. x + (12 - x) > 4Solving these inequalities step by step:1. For 4 + x > 12 - x, adding x to both sides and subtracting 4 from both sides gives 2x > 8, which simplifies to x > 4.2. For 4 + (12 - x) > x, simplifying gives 16 - x > x, which leads to 16 > 2x, and further simplification gives x  4, this simplifies to 12 > 4, which is always true and does not provide a new constraint on x.Combining the results from 1 and 2, we find that the range of values for x is 4 < x < 8. Therefore, the answer to part (1) is boxed{4 < x < 8}.Part (2): Finding the perimeter of the isosceles triangleFor the triangle to be isosceles, two sides must be equal. We consider three cases based on which sides could be equal:1. If 4 = x, then 12 - x = 8. This does not satisfy the triangle inequality theorem for an isosceles triangle, so we discard this case.2. If 4 = 12 - x, then x = 8. This also does not satisfy the triangle inequality theorem for an isosceles triangle, so we discard this case.3. If x = 12 - x, solving for x gives x = 6. This satisfies the condition for an isosceles triangle where the sides are x, 12-x, and 4.Therefore, the value of x that makes the triangle isosceles is x = 6. This means the two equal sides are x = 6 and 12 - x = 6. The third side is 4.The perimeter of the isosceles triangle is the sum of its sides, which is 4 + 6 + 6 = 16.

Understand the Relationship: The sales volume y is inversely proportional to the selling price x. This means y = k/x, where k is a constant.2. Find the Constant of Proportionality: From the table, when x = 400, y = 20. We can use these values to find k.   [   k = x times y = 400 times 20 = 8000   ]3. Express Sales Volume in Terms of x: Now that we know k = 8000, the sales volume as a function of x is:   [   y = frac{8000}{x}   ]4. Calculate the Desired Profit: The profit from selling one unit is the selling price minus the cost price, which is (x - 180). To achieve a total profit of 3500, the profit per unit times the number of units sold must equal 3500:   [   (x - 180) times frac{8000}{x} = 3500   ]5.

All pin codes in this list must receive a different color. For this list, you already need 37 colors.We will now show that 37 colors are sufficient to color all possible pin codes. If we add up all four digits of a pin code, we get a number which we call the strength of the pin code. Pin code 0000 has strength 0 and 9999 has strength 36. All pin codes have a strength between 0 and 36. If pin code A is dominated by another pin code, say B, then the strength of B is greater than the strength of A.

For example, consider 2021 with strength 5 and 0089 with strength 17: 2021 is not dominated by 0089.)We will use the strength to color the pin codes. We use one color per strength. Thus, all pin codes with the same strength receive the same color, and pin codes with different strengths always receive different colors. In this way, it can never happen that pin code A is dominated by another pin code B, but A and B have the same color. The strength of a pin code is a number from 0,1, ldots, 36.

Relate the segments using the properties of the rhombus:   - Since (P) and (Q) are on (AD) and the lines through (M) are perpendicular to (BD) and (AC), we can use the properties of perpendiculars and the symmetry of the rhombus.   - Let (frac{BM}{MC} = x).4.

Set up the ratio using the concurrency condition:   - Given that (PB), (QC), and (AM) are concurrent, we can use the fact that the ratio of segments created by the concurrency point is equal.   - Therefore, (frac{BM}{MC} = frac{PA}{AQ}).6.

Identify the Symmetry Group:   The symmetry group of the hexagon consists of 6 elements: 3 rotations (0°, 120°, 240°) and 3 reflections (across axes passing through opposite vertices or midpoints of opposite sides).2. Calculate Fixed Points for Each Symmetry:   - 0° Rotation (Identity):     Every coloring is fixed under the identity rotation. The number of ways to color the disks with 2 black, 2 white, and 2 blue is given by the multinomial coefficient:     [     binom{6}{2,2,2} = frac{6!}{2!2!2!} = 90     ]   - 120° and 240° Rotations:     For a coloring to be fixed under a 120° or 240° rotation, each set of 2 disks of the same color must be positioned 120° apart. This is impossible with 2 disks of each color, so there are no fixed points:     [     text{Fixed points} = 0     ]   - Reflections:     Each reflection axis divides the hexagon into two sets of 3 disks. For a coloring to be fixed under reflection, each pair of disks on either side of the axis must be the same color. There are 3 reflection axes, and for each axis, we can choose 2 out of the 3 positions on one side to be black, white, or blue. This gives:     [     binom{3}{1,1,1} = frac{3!}{1!1!1!} = 6     ]     Since there are 3 reflection axes, the total number of fixed points for reflections is:     [     3 times 6 = 18     ]3. Apply Burnside's Lemma:   Burnside's Lemma states that the number of distinct colorings is the average number of fixed points of the group actions:   [   text{Number of distinct colorings} = frac{1}{|G|} sum_{g in G} text{Fixed points of } g   ]   Here, (|G| = 6) (the number of symmetries), and the sum of fixed points is:   [   90 (text{identity}) + 0 (text{120° rotation}) + 0 (text{240° rotation}) + 18 (text{reflections}) = 108   ]   Therefore, the number of distinct colorings is:   [   frac{108}{6} = 18   ]The final answer is (boxed{18})."},{"problem":"Given that {a_n} is an arithmetic sequence, and a_1+a_2+a_3=156, a_2+a_3+a_4=147, with the sum of the first n terms of {a_n} denoted as S_n, then the value of n that maximizes S_n is (　　)  A: 19  B: 20  C: 21  D: 22","solution":"Let the common difference of the sequence {a_n} be d.

Determine the total number of ways to select 3 students out of 5: This is a combination problem where we are choosing 3 students from a group of 5 without regard to the order in which they are chosen. The formula for combinations is {C}_{n}^{r} = frac{n!}{r!(n-r)!}, where n is the total number of items, and r is the number of items to choose. Applying this formula, we get the total number of ways to select 3 students from 5 as {C}_{5}^{3} = frac{5!}{3!(5-3)!} = frac{5 times 4}{2} = 10.2. Determine the number of ways A and B can both be selected along with one other student: Since A and B must both be selected, we only need to choose 1 more student from the remaining 3 students. Again, using the combination formula, we find the number of ways to choose 1 student from 3 as {C}_{3}^{1} = frac{3!}{1!(3-1)!} = 3.3. Calculate the probability that both A and B are selected: The probability is the ratio of the number of favorable outcomes to the total number of possible outcomes. The number of favorable outcomes is the number of ways to select A and B along with one other student, and the total number of possible outcomes is the total number of ways to select any 3 students from 5. Therefore, the probability P is given by P = frac{{C}_{3}^{1}}{{C}_{5}^{3}} = frac{3}{10}.Thus, the probability that both A and B are selected when 3 students are chosen at random from 5 is boxed{frac{3}{10}}."},{"problem":"5.

Event B is \\"the sum of the numbers on both dice is greater than 8.\\" The possible outcomes that satisfy this condition are (considering the blue die first): 4+5, 4+6, 6+3, 6+4, 6+5, and 6+6. There are 6 outcomes that satisfy both A and B. However, since event A has already occurred, we only consider the outcomes of the red die when combined with A. This means that for the blue die being 4, the red die can be 5 or 6, and for the blue die being 6, the red die can be 3, 4, 5, or 6.

Since events A and B are complementary (either the group includes at least one female or it doesn't, meaning it's all males), the sum of their probabilities equals 1.

For the total number of shirts: x + y = 200.2. For the total cost: 25x + 15y = 3500.To solve this system, we can use the method of substitution or elimination. Here, we'll use elimination for simplicity:- Multiply the first equation by 15 to align the coefficients of y: 15x + 15y = 3000.- Subtract this new equation from the second equation to eliminate y: (25x + 15y) - (15x + 15y) = 3500 - 3000.- Simplifying, we get 10x = 500 Rightarrow x = 50.Substituting x = 50 back into the first equation to find y:- 50 + y = 200 Rightarrow y = 150.Therefore, the school purchased boxed{50} black shirts and boxed{150} white shirts.# Part 2: Calculating the Total ProfitTo calculate the profit, we need to consider the difference between the retail price and the wholesale price for each shirt, multiplied by the number of shirts sold:- Profit from black shirts: (50 - 25) times 50 = 25 times 50 = 1250 yuan.- Profit from white shirts: (35 - 15) times 150 = 20 times 150 = 3000 yuan.Adding these together gives the total profit:- Total profit = 1250 + 3000 = 4250 yuan.Therefore, the school made a total profit of boxed{4250} yuan from this charity sale."},{"problem":"Calculate:  (1) (x-2)^{2}-(x-3)(x+3);  (2) frac{x^2+2x}{x^2-1}÷(x+1+frac{2x+1}{x-1}).","solution":"To solve the given problems in a step-by-step format, we proceed as follows: Problem 1:Calculate (x-2)^{2}-(x-3)(x+3).# Solution:begin{align*}(x-2)^{2}-(x-3)(x+3) &= (x^2-4x+4) - (x^2-9) &= x^2 - 4x + 4 - x^2 + 9 &= -4x + 13.end{align*}Thus, the simplified expression is boxed{-4x + 13}.

A polyhedron is called regular if all its faces are regular and congruent polygons to each other and all its polyhedral angles are also regular and congruent to each other { }^{2}.

If a regular n-sided pyramid is constructed from the found magnitude of the dihedral angle, with the base being a regular n-sided polygon - a face of the desired polyhedron, then from such congruent pyramids, a regular polyhedron can be assembled (for example, a cube is assembled from six regular quadrilateral pyramids with a common vertex at the center of the cube). It can be proven that any regular polyhedron can be obtained by such a construction. (The last remark can be used without proof in solving this and the following problems.)## 44","solution":"36. Let the faces of a regular polyhedron be regular n-gons, and the polyhedral angles at the vertices be regular m-gonal angles; obviously, m geqslant 3, n geqslant 3. Divide the space into f congruent regular n-gonal angles with a common vertex S such that around each edge [S A) there are m angles. Then the magnitude of each of these f polyhedral angles is frac{4 pi}{f}. Since this magnitude is the difference between the sum of the magnitudes of its dihedral angles and the number pi(n-2), the sum of all dihedral angles of the n-gonal angle is frac{4 pi}{f} + pi(n-2) = frac{4 + nf - 2f}{f} pi. One dihedral angle has a magnitude that is n times smaller, i.e., frac{4 + nf - 2f}{nf} pi.On the other hand, since at each of the p edges of our n-gonal angles there are m congruent dihedral angles, the magnitude of each of them is frac{2 pi}{m}. Thus,begin{gathered}frac{2 pi}{m} = frac{4 + nf - 2f}{nf} pi 2nf + 2mf - mnf = 4m f = frac{4m}{2m + 2n - mn}end{gathered}## 168Since f > 0, m > 0, from (1) we have 2m + 2n - mn > 0,frac{2}{m} + frac{2}{n} > 1Thus, the division of space into congruent polyhedral angles is possible only if the numbers m geqslant 3 and n geqslant 3 satisfy the inequality (2). Clearly, only five cases are possible: 1) m=3 and n=3: frac{2}{3} + frac{2}{3} > 1. From (1) we get f=4, the polyhedron is bounded by 4 triangles - this is a tetrahedron. The corresponding values of the numbers a and p are obtained from the formulas in problems 27 and 28: for the tetrahedron a=6, p=4.2) For m=3, n=4 we get: frac{2}{3} + frac{2}{4} > 1, f=6.

For further increases in the values of m and n, the expression on the left side of the inequality (2) becomes even smaller, and it cannot be valid.

Let's evaluate the statements based on this understanding:   - Statement A says there must be 75 data points less than or equal to 9.3 among the 100 data points. While this might seem correct at first glance, consider a scenario where all 100 data points are exactly 9.3. In this case, 9.3 is still the 75th percentile, but not in the way A describes. Thus, we cannot say A is universally correct without exceptions.   - Statement B suggests that 9.3 is the 75th data point when arranged in ascending order. This interpretation is a common misunderstanding. The 75th percentile doesn't necessarily equate to the 75th data point directly but rather indicates a threshold below which 75% of the data lies.   - Statement C claims that when arranging the 100 data points in ascending order, 9.3 is the average of the 75th and 76th data points. Given that 75% of 100 is exactly 75, and by definition, when a percentile falls on an exact index, the percentile value is typically computed as the average between the value at that index and the next. This aligns with how percentiles are calculated in many statistical contexts, making statement C a correct interpretation of the 75th percentile for a sample size of 100.   - Statement D posits that 9.3 is the average of the 75th and 74th data points. This interpretation misunderstands the percentile calculation, especially when the percentile falls on a precise number within the dataset's range.Given these considerations, the correct statement is C, as it accurately reflects the method for determining the 75th percentile in a dataset of 100 points when the percentile calculation results in an exact integer position within the dataset.Therefore, the correct answer is boxed{C}."},{"problem":"The sets A and B are subsets of the positive integers.

Mathematically, this is expressed as:[r_{2}-r_{1}leqslant C_{1}C_{2}leqslant r_{2}+r_{1}]We calculate the distance between the centers C_{1}C_{2} using the distance formula:[C_{1}C_{2} = sqrt{(a-0)^{2}+(0-2)^{2}} = sqrt{a^{2}+4}]Substituting the values of r_{1} and r_{2} into the inequality, we get:[4 leqslant sqrt{a^{2}+4} leqslant 6]Squaring all parts of the inequality to eliminate the square root (and noting that squaring maintains the inequality since all terms are positive), we obtain:[16 leqslant a^{2} + 4 leqslant 36]Subtracting 4 from all parts of the inequality gives us:[12 leqslant a^{2} leqslant 32]Taking the square root of all parts (and considering a geqslant 0), we find:[2sqrt{3} leqslant a leqslant 4sqrt{2}]Therefore, the range of the real number a is [2sqrt{3}, 4sqrt{2}].

They form an [equilateral triangle](https://artofproblemsolving.com/wiki/index.php/Equilateral_triangle) with the origin.

We then getrho = frac {cos{0}}{sin{frac {pi}{3}}} = frac {2}{sqrt {3}}Then, rho^2 = frac {4}{3}, and the answer is 3+4=boxed{007}.(For a non-calculus way to maximize the function above:Let us work with degrees. Let f(x)=frac{cos x}{sin(x+60)}. We need to maximize f on [0,30]. Suppose k is an upper bound of f on this range; in other words, assume f(x)le k for all x in this range. Then: [cos xle ksin(x+60)=kcdotleft(frac{sqrt{3}}{2}cos x+frac{1}{2}sin xright)][rightarrow 0le left(frac{sqrt{3}k}{2}-1right)cos x+frac{k}{2}sin xrightarrow 0le (sqrt{3}k-2)cos x+ksin x][rightarrow (2-sqrt{3}k)cos xle ksin xrightarrow frac{2-sqrt{3}k}{k}le tan x,]for all x in [0,30]. In particular, for x=0, frac{2-sqrt{3}k}{k} must be less than or equal to 0, so kge frac{2}{sqrt{3}}.The least possible upper bound of f on this interval is k=frac{2}{sqrt{3}}. This inequality must hold by the above logic, and in fact, the inequality reaches equality when x=0. Thus, f(x) attains a maximum of frac{2}{sqrt{3}} on the interval.)Solution 3Consider a [cyclic quadrilateral](https://artofproblemsolving.com/wiki/index.php/Cyclic_quadrilateral) ABCD with angle B = angle D = 90^{circ}, and AB = y, BC = a, CD = b, AD = x. Then[AC^2 = a^2 + y^2 = b^2 + x^2]From [Ptolemy's Theorem](https://artofproblemsolving.com/wiki/index.php/Ptolemy%27s_Theorem), ax + by = AC(BD), so[AC^2 = (a - x)^2 + (b - y)^2 = a^2 + y^2 + b^2 + x^2 - 2(ax + by) = 2AC^2 - 2AC*BD]Simplifying, we have BD = AC/2. Note the [circumcircle](https://artofproblemsolving.com/wiki/index.php/Circumcircle) of ABCD has [radius](https://artofproblemsolving.com/wiki/index.php/Radius) r = AC/2, so BD = r and has an arc of 60^{circ}, so angle C = 30^{circ}. Let angle BDC = theta.frac ab = frac{BC}{CD} = frac{sin theta}{sin(150^{circ} - theta)}, where both theta and 150^{circ} - theta are leq 90^{circ} since triangle BCD must be [acute](https://artofproblemsolving.com/wiki/index.php/Acute_triangle). Since sin is an increasing function over (0, 90^{circ}), frac{sin theta}{sin(150^{circ} - theta)} is also increasing function over (60^{circ}, 90^{circ}).frac ab maximizes at theta = 90^{circ} Longrightarrow frac ab maximizes at frac 2{sqrt {3}}. This squared is (frac 2{sqrt {3}})^2 = frac4{3}, and 4 +  3 = boxed{007}.Note:None of the above solutions point out clearly the importance of the restriction that a, b, x and y be positive. Indeed, larger values of p are obtained when the lower vertex of the equilateral triangle in Solution 2 dips below the x-axis. Take for example -15= theta. This yields p = (1 + sqrt{3})/2 > 4/3Solution 4The problem is looking for an intersection in the said range between parabola P: y = tfrac{(x-a)^2 + b^2-a^2}{2b} and the hyperbola H: y^2 = x^2 + b^2 - a^2. The vertex of P is below the x-axis and it's x-coordinate is a, which is to the right of the vertex of the H, which is sqrt{a^2 - b^2}. So for the intersection to exist with x<a and y geq 0, P needs to cross x-axis between sqrt{a^2 - b^2}, and a, meaning,[(sqrt{a^2 - b^2}-a)^2 + b^2-a^2 geq 0]Divide both side by b^2,[(sqrt{rho^2 - 1}-rho)^2 + 1-rho^2 geq 0]which can be easily solved by moving 1-rho^2 to RHS and taking square roots. Final answer rho^2 leq frac{4}{3}boxed{007}Solution 5The given system is equivalent to the points (a,y) and (x,b) forming an equilateral triangle with the origin. WLOG let this triangle have side length 1, so x=sqrt{1-a^2}. The condition x<a implies (x,b) lies to the left of (a,y), so (x,b) is the top vertex. Now we can compute (by complex numbers, or the sine angle addition identity) that b = frac{sqrt{3}}{2}a + frac{1}{2}sqrt{1-a^2}, so frac{a}{b} = frac{a}{frac{sqrt{3}}{2}a + frac{1}{2}sqrt{1-a^2}} = frac{1}{frac{sqrt{3}}{2} + frac{1}{2a}sqrt{1-a^2}}. Minimizing this is equivalent to minimizing the denominator, which happens when sqrt{1-a^2} = 0 and thus a=1, resulting in rho = frac{2}{sqrt{3}}, so rho^2 = frac{4}{3} and the answer is boxed{007}.As a remark, expressing the condition that the triangle is equilateral purely algebraically instead of using trig eliminates the need for calculus or analyzing the behavior of sine.Solution 6 (Geometry and Trigonometry)Notice that by Pythagorean theorem, if we take a triangle with vertices (0,0), (a,y), and (x,b) forming an equilateral triangle. Now, take a rectangle with vertices (0,0), (a,0), (0,b), (a,b). Notice that (a,y) and (x,b) are on the sides. Let alpha be the angle formed by the points (0,b), (0,0), (x,b). Then, we have that [cos alpha = frac{b}{s},] where s is the side of the equilateral triangle. Also, we have that 30^{circ}-alpha is the angle formed by the points (a,0), (0,0), (a,y), and so [cos (30^{circ}-alpha) = frac{a}{s}.] Thus, we have that [frac{a}{b} = frac{cos (30^{circ}-alpha)}{cos alpha}.] We see that this expression is maximized when alpha is maximized (at least when alpha is in the interval (0,90^{circ}), which it is). Then, alpha ge 30^{circ}, so ew have that the maximum of frac{a}{b} is [frac{cos 0}{cos 30^{circ}} = frac{2}{sqrt{3}},] and so our answer is 4+3 = 7."},{"problem":"25.

Common Denominator Approach:   - We start by finding a common denominator for the fractions. Let's consider the common denominator to be ( 1 + z + zx ).   - To achieve this, we multiply the first fraction by ( frac{z}{z} ) and the second fraction by ( frac{xz}{xz} ).2. Rewriting the Fractions:   - The first fraction becomes:     [     frac{1}{1+x+xy} cdot frac{z}{z} = frac{z}{z(1+x+xy)} = frac{z}{1+z+zx}     ]   - The second fraction becomes:     [     frac{1}{1+y+yz} cdot frac{xz}{xz} = frac{xz}{xz(1+y+yz)} = frac{xz}{1+z+zx}     ]   - The third fraction remains:     [     frac{1}{1+z+zx}     ]3. Combining the Fractions:   - Now, we can combine the fractions since they have a common denominator:     [     frac{z}{1+z+zx} + frac{xz}{1+z+zx} + frac{1}{1+z+zx}     ]   - Combine the numerators:     [     frac{z + xz + 1}{1+z+zx}     ]4. Simplifying the Numerator:   - Notice that the numerator ( z + xz + 1 ) can be factored as:     [     z + xz + 1 = z(1 + x) + 1     ]   - Given the condition ( xyz = 1 ), we know ( z = frac{1}{xy} ). Substituting ( z ) in the numerator:     [     frac{1}{xy}(1 + x) + 1 = frac{1 + x}{xy} + 1     ]   - However, this substitution is not necessary for the final simplification.5. Final Simplification:   - The numerator ( z + xz + 1 ) is exactly the same as the denominator ( 1 + z + zx ):     [     frac{z + xz + 1}{1+z+zx} = frac{1+z+zx}{1+z+zx} = 1     ]Thus, the value of the given expression is:[boxed{1}]"},{"problem":"Evaluate the definite integral int_{0}^{2}(x+e^{x})dx = ______.","solution":"Step 1: Understanding the ProblemThis problem requires us to compute a definite integral involving a sum of two functions, x and e^x.Step 2: Break Down the IntegralWe can break down the given integral into two separate integrals, i.e.,int_{0}^{2}(x+e^{x})dx = int_{0}^{2}xdx + int_{0}^{2}e^{x}dx.Step 3: Evaluate Each IntegralNow, let's evaluate each integral separately.For the first integral, int_{0}^{2}xdx, we have an antiderivative of x, which is frac{1}{2}x^2.

Replacing a with 5-a changes a(a-5) to (5-a) times(-a)=a(a-5). In particular, since a+5-a=5, the maximum of a and 5-a is greater than or equal to frac{a+5-a}{2}=2.5, so as it is an integer, it is greater than or equal to 3. Thus, we can assume a geq 3. Similarly, we can assume b geq 4.Let's first consider the case where C is negative: we have 0 leq a leq 5, so a=3,4 or 5. We then get C=-6,-4,0. We also have 0 leq b leq 8, so b=4,5,6,7 or 8, thus C=-16,-15,-12,-7,0. In particular, the only possible case is C=0, which is indeed possible if a=5 and b=8.Now suppose C>0. Since a geq 3 and b geq 4 and C=a(a-5)=b(b-8), we have a geq 6 and b geq 9. We can then try to compare a and b.If a geq b, a(a-5) geq b(b-5)>b(b-8), which is contradictory. Thus a < b. Since a < b, a(a-5) < b(b-5), so a-5 < b-5, thus a < b. Since a(a-5) = b(b-8), we have a-5 < b-8, so a < b-3. Therefore, since a and b are integers, we have b-1 geq a geq b-2.

It follows that the lowest scoring team can score no more than n-2 points.We now show by induction that it is indeed possible for the lowest scoring team to score n-2 points.The following scoreboard shows this is possible for n=4 :| - | 3 | 1 | 1 | 5 || :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: || 0 | - | 1 | 3 | 4 || 1 | 1 | - | 1 | 3 || 1 | 0 | 1 | - | 2 |Now suppose we have a scoreboard for n teams labelled T_{n-2}, ldots, T_{2 n-3}, where team T_{i} scores i points. Keep the results among these teams unchanged while adding one more team.Write n=3 q+r with r in{1,-1,0}, and let the new team tie with just one of the original teams, lose against q teams, and win against the rest of them. The new team thus wins n-1-q games, and gets 1+3(n-1-q)=3 n-2-3 q=2 n-2+r points.Moreover, we arrange for the q teams which win against the new team to form an arithmetic sequence T_{j}, T_{j+3}, ldots, T_{j+3(q-1)}=T_{j+n-r-3}, so that each of them, itself having gained three points, fills the slot vacated by the next one.(i) If r=1, then let the new team tie with team T_{n-2} and lose to each of the teams T_{n-1}, T_{n+2}, ldots, T_{n-1+n-r-3}=T_{2 n-5}.Team T_{n-2} now has n-1 points and takes the place vacated by T_{n-1}. At the other end, T_{2 n-5} now has 2 n-2 points, just one more than the previous top team T_{2 n-3}. And the new team has 2 n-2+r=2 n-1 points, becoming the new top team. The teams now have all scores from n-1 up to 2 n-1.(ii) If r=-1, then let the new team tie with team T_{2 n-3} and lose to each of the teams T_{n-2}, T_{n+1}, ldots, T_{n-2+n-r-3}=T_{2 n-4}.The old top team T_{2 n-3} now has 2 n-2 points, and its former place is filled by the new team, which gets 2 n-2+r=2 n-3 points. T_{2 n-4} now has 2 n-1 points and is the new top team. So again we have all scores ranging from n-1 up to 2 n-1.(iii) If r=0, then let the new team tie with team T_{n-2} and lose to teams T_{n-1}, T_{n+2}, ldots, T_{n-1+n-r-3}=T_{2 n-4}.Team T_{n-2} now has n-1 points and fills the slot vacated by T_{n-1}. At the top end, T_{2 n-4} now has 2 n-1 points, while the new team has 2 n-2+r=2 n-2 points, and yet again we have all scores from n-1 to 2 n-1.This concludes the proof."},{"problem":"Define a domino to be an ordered pair of distinct positive integers.

(Reasoning for this: Everytime you go to a vertex, you have to leave the vertex, so every vertex reached is equivalent to adding 2 more segments. So the degree of each vertex must be even, with the exception of endpoints) Since there are 39 segments coming from each point it is impossible to touch every segment.But you can get up to 38 on each segment because you go in to the point then out on a different segment.

Case ( n le 10 ):   - For ( n le 10 ), we need to show that all ( beta in (0,1) ) work. We will construct an example for ( n = 10 ).   - Let ( beta = frac{p}{q} ) where ( gcd(p, q) = 1 ).   - Define the integers ( a_1, a_2, ldots, a_{10} ) as follows:     [     begin{aligned}     a_1 &= overbrace{99 ldots 9}^{k text{ digits}} overbrace{00 ldots 1}^{k text{ digits}} ldots overbrace{00 ldots 1}^{k text{ digits}},      a_2 &= overbrace{00 ldots 1}^{k text{ digits}} overbrace{99 ldots 9}^{k text{ digits}} ldots overbrace{00 ldots 1}^{k text{ digits}},      &vdots      a_{10} &= overbrace{00 ldots 1}^{k text{ digits}} overbrace{00 ldots 1}^{k text{ digits}} ldots overbrace{99 ldots 9}^{k text{ digits}},     end{aligned}     ]     where there are 10 blocks of ( k ) digits, each integer has one of these blocks (different for each one) being ( 99 ldots 9 ) and the rest as ( 00 ldots 1 ).   - For any positive integer ( l ), we may add on the end of each ( a_i ) a string of some large length (fixed over all ( a_i )) with digit sum ( l ), making sure to keep no two strings from carrying with each other. This results in a ( beta ) of:     [     beta = frac{18 + l}{18 + 18k + l}.     ]   - If we set ( k = q - p ) and ( l = 18(p - 1) ), this works.2. Case ( n ge 11 ):   - For ( n = 11 ) or above, no ( beta in (0,1) ) exists. The key idea is that for two disjoint subsets ( I_1, I_2 subset {1, 2, ldots, 11} ),     [     Sleft(sum_{i in I_1} a_iright) + Sleft(sum_{i in I_2} a_iright) = beta sum_{i in I_1 cup I_2} S(a_i) = Sleft(sum_{i in I_1 cup I_2} a_iright).     ]   - So when you add ( sum_{i in I_1} a_i ) and ( sum_{i in I_2} a_i ), no carrying occurs.   - Look at the smallest digit ( D ) where ( a_i + a_j ) carry for some ( i, j ). This must exist otherwise ( beta = 1 ).   - We claim there are ( I_1, I_2 ) where ( sum_{i in I_1} a_i ) and ( sum_{i in I_2} a_i ) carry at ( D ), causing contradiction.   - Call ( a_i )'s ( D )th digit ( d_i ). Suppose WLOG ( d_1 ge d_2 ge ldots ge d_{11} ), where ( d_1 + d_2 ge 10 ).   - Take ( I_1 = {1, 10} ) and ( I_2 = {2, 11} ); noting ( d_1 + d_2 + d_{10} + d_{11} ge 10 ), we have ( d_1 + d_{10} ge 10 ). So ( d_{10} ge 1 ) and only one digit can be ( 0 ).   - Call a pair of digits ( d_i, d_j ) *cool* if ( d_i + d_j ) has units digit ( >1 ). Greedily choose cool pairs until there are no more left. Let's say we have chosen ( 0 le m le 5 ) cool pairs leaving ( 11 - 2m ) digits unused, no two of which are cool.   - If there are 3 or more, one of them must be ( 0 ) or ( 5 ). Suppose ( 0 ) is unused. If some unused digit is ( >1 ), it forms a cool pair with ( 0 ). Otherwise, two unused digits are ( 1 ), but then they are cool.   - So ( 5 ) must be unused. No pair of cool unused numbers exists, so either the unused digits are all ( 5 )s, or all ( 5 )s and one ( 6 ).   - Greedily group together triples of unused digits. Each of these sum to ( 5 ) or more. Verify:     [     5 leftlfloor frac{11 - 2m}{3} rightrfloor + 2m ge 10.     ]   - So we have disjoint groups ( B_1, B_2, ldots, B_k ) of multiple digits each, where if we let their sums have units digits of ( b_1, b_2, ldots, b_k ) respectively, we have ( b_1 + b_2 + ldots + b_k ge 10 ).   - Take the smallest index ( i ) where ( b_1 + ldots + b_i ge 10 ). Put ( B_1 ) through ( B_{i-1} ) in ( I_1 ) and ( B_i ) in ( I_2 ); the end.(blacksquare)The final answer is ( boxed{ n le 10 } ) and ( beta in (0,1) )."},{"problem":"If a chord of the ellipse dfrac{{{x}^{2}}}{36}+ dfrac{{{y}^{2}}}{9}=1 is bisected by the point (4,2), then the equation of the line on which this chord lies is _______.","solution":"[Analysis]This problem tests the application of the midpoint formula and the method of finding the slope (k) of a line through subtraction in the context of conic sections, specifically ellipses.

Calculate 10a:   [   10a = 10 cdot sqrt{frac{2013}{2014}} = sqrt{100 cdot frac{2013}{2014}} = sqrt{frac{201300}{2014}}   ]   Since frac{201300}{2014} approx 99.5, we have:   [   sqrt{frac{201300}{2014}} approx sqrt{99.5} approx 9.975   ]   Therefore, [10a] = [9.975] = 9.5. Calculate 9a:   [   9a = 9 cdot sqrt{frac{2013}{2014}} = sqrt{81 cdot frac{2013}{2014}} = sqrt{frac{162117}{2014}}   ]   Since frac{162117}{2014} approx 80.5, we have:   [   sqrt{frac{162117}{2014}} approx sqrt{80.5} approx 8.975   ]   Therefore, [9a] = [8.975] = 8.6. Now, we can find x_9:   [   x_9 = [10a] - [9a] = 9 - 8 = 1   ]The final answer is boxed{1}."},{"problem":"7.135. left{begin{array}{l}lg left(x^{2}+y^{2}right)=2,  log _{2} x-4=log _{2} 3-log _{2} y .end{array}right.The system of equations is:7.135. left{begin{array}{l}lg left(x^{2}+y^{2}right)=2,  log _{2} x-4=log _{2} 3-log _{2} y .end{array}right.","solution":"## Solution.Domain of definition: left{begin{array}{l}x>0,  y>0 .end{array}right.From the first equation of the system, we have x^{2}+y^{2}=100.

For each pair, there are (d) different people who shake hands with both (A) and (B). The number of such pairs ((A, B)) is given by (binom{12k}{2} = frac{12k(12k-1)}{2}). Therefore, the total number of pairs ((A, {B, C})) is:     [     d times binom{12k}{2} = d times frac{12k(12k-1)}{2}     ]   - Second, consider each person (P).

Let point A have coordinates left(x_{1} ; 0right), and point C have coordinates left(x_{2} ; 0right). From the condition, it is clear that x_{1} < 0 and x_{2} > 0. Since x_{1} and x_{2} are the roots of the quadratic trinomial f(x), by Vieta's theorem, we have x_{1} cdot x_{2} = 12b, from which we get b = frac{x_{1} cdot x_{2}}{12} < 0.Let H be the point with coordinates (3 ; 0) (Fig. 11). Clearly, in the isosceles triangle A T C, the segment T H is the height, and therefore it is also the median. Thus, 3 - x_{1} = A H = H C = x_{2} - 3, from which we get x_{1} = 6 - x_{2}.Let M be the point with coordinates (0, 3). Since T H = T M = 3 and T A = T B, the right triangles A T H and B T M are equal by the leg and hypotenuse. Therefore, 3 - x_{1} = H A = M B = 3 - b, that is, x_{1} = b = frac{x_{1} cdot x_{2}}{12} (by Vieta's theorem), from which we find x_{2} = 12. Finally, x_{1} = 6 - x_{2} = 6 - 12 = -6 and b = x_{1} = -6.Another solution. As in the previous solution, let the abscissas of points A and C be x_{1} and x_{2}, respectively; we will also use the fact that point B has coordinates (0 ; b).

The chords A C and B D of the circle intersect at the origin O; from the properties of the circle, we know that O A cdot O C = O B cdot O D.

If z is a root of a polynomial with real coefficients, then bar{z} is also a root. Therefore, we have one of three cases: bar{a}=a^{2}, bar{a}=a^{3}, or bar{a}=a^{4}.If bar{a}=a^{2}, then |a|=|a|^{2}, and since a neq 0, it follows that |a|=1. Furthermore, we get a^{3}=a^{2} cdot a=bar{a} cdot a=|a|^{2}=1.

We can first determine that the distribution can be divided into 2, 2, and 1 books.Step-by-step solution1. First, we will find the number of ways to choose 2 books out of 5 for the first two students who will receive 2 books each. This can be calculated using the combination formula: C_5^2=dfrac{5!}{2!(5-2)!}=10.2. Next, we have 3 books remaining (as the first two students have already received their books), and we will choose 2 books for the second student who will receive 2 books. Again, using the combination formula: C_3^2=dfrac{3!}{2!(3-2)!}=3.3. Now, we have considered the distribution of books to the first two students receiving 2 books each. However, since there are two students receiving the same number of books, we need to divide the result by the number of arrangements of these students (A_2^2 = 2).4. Finally, there is only 1 book left, and it will be given to the last student. There are A_3^3 = 3 ways to choose this last student.5. Combining these results, we find the total number of distribution methods: frac{C_5^2 C_3^2}{A_2^2} cdot A_3^3 = frac{10 cdot 3}{2} cdot 3 = 90Therefore, there are boxed{90} different methods to distribute the books."},{"problem":"Example 10.

By utilizing the given information that one focus of the hyperbola frac{x^2}{9} - frac{y^2}{m} = 1 is at (5, 0), we can derive the equation 9 + m = 25 to find the value of m.Step-by-step Solution1. Recall that the standard equation of a hyperbola with foci on the x-axis is given by frac{(x-h)^2}{a^2} - frac{(y-k)^2}{b^2} = 1. In this problem, the hyperbola is centered at the origin, so h = 0 and k = 0. The equation becomes frac{x^2}{a^2} - frac{y^2}{b^2} = 1.2. The given hyperbola equation is frac{x^2}{9} - frac{y^2}{m} = 1. By comparing it with the standard equation, we can conclude that a^2 = 9 and b^2 = m.3. The distance between the center of the hyperbola and one of its foci is represented by c (the linear eccentricity). In this problem, we are given that one focus lies at (5, 0). Since the center is at (0, 0), we can find c using the distance formula: c = sqrt{(5-0)^2 + (0-0)^2} = 5.4. Recall the relationship between a, b, and c for a hyperbola: c^2 = a^2 + b^2. In this problem, c^2 = 5^2 = 25, a^2 = 9, and b^2 = m. Substituting these values into the relationship, we get 25 = 9 + m.5.

Analyze the transformed sequence:   The recurrence relation for {y_n} is a linear homogeneous recurrence relation.

Since the roots of 2x^{2}-5x+2=0 are x=2 and x=frac{1}{2}, and the eccentricity e in (0,1), we discard x=2.

Otherwise, we can assume sin 70^{circ}=frac{p}{q},(p, q)=1, p, q in mathbf{N}_{+}. Substituting into the triple angle formula and rearranging gives 8 p^{3}- 6 p q^{2}-q^{3}=0. This implies left{begin{array}{l}p mid q^{3}  q^{2} mid 8 p^{3}end{array}right., and since (p, q)=1, we have left{begin{array}{l}p=1  q=1 text { or } 2end{array}right., substituting these values does not hold.Therefore, the pair (a, b) that satisfies the conditions is unique."},{"problem":"9.4.

What is the largest integer mathrm{n} for which this is possible?","solution":"Solution to Exercise 12 In this problem, we are looking for the largest integer satisfying a certain property. Suppose we want to show that the largest integer sought is the integer c. To show that c is indeed the largest integer, we will on the one hand show that if an integer n satisfies the property, then n ≤ c, and on the other hand we will show that we can find a table with exactly c columns.The statement presents a hypothesis concerning the rows and columns of a table.We start by looking at the information we have about the rows of this table. There are 8 rows, so there are (binom{8}{2} = 28) pairs of rows.We then look at the information we have about the columns of the table. Since the hypothesis in the statement mentions identical letters within the same column, we will count how many pairs of identical letters belong to the same column. We fix a column of the table and see how many pairs of identical letters we can form at a minimum. After several trials on a column of size 8, we conjecture that there are always at least 4 pairs of identical letters within the same column. Indeed, in a column there are 8 letters, so a letter appears at least 2 times.- If each letter appears at most 2 times, then each letter appears exactly 2 times since there are 8 cells in the column and 4 possible letters. We thus have 4 pairs of identical letters in the column.- If a letter appears exactly 3 times, say the letter P, then we can form 3 pairs of letters P. Among the 5 remaining letters, at least one of the letters O, F, and M appears twice according to the pigeonhole principle, which gives us a fourth pair of identical letters.- If a letter appears at least 4 times in the column, say the letter P, we can form 4 pairs of letters P.Thus, in a column, we can always find 4 pairs of identical letters. Therefore, for each column, there are at least 4 pairs of rows such that the intersections with the column have the same letter. But according to the hypothesis in the statement, a pair of rows can be associated with at most one column such that its intersections with the two rows are two cells containing the same letter. We deduce that there are at most (4 times n) pairs of rows. Therefore, (4n leq 28) and (n leq 7).Conversely, there exists a configuration with the following 7 columns:| P | P | P | P | P | P | P || :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- || O | O | O | O | O | P | O || F | F | F | F | O | O | P || M | M | M | M | P | O | O || P | M | F | O | F | F | F || O | F | M | P | M | F | M || F | P | P | M | M | M | F || M | O | O | F | F | M | M |The largest integer n of columns is therefore n = 7.Comment from the gradersMany students managed to find the answer n = 7 and provided an example.
