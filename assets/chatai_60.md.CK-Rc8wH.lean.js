I am 48 years old and weight 13.5 stone. I was previously diagnosed with breat cancer on 7th July 2015 resuting in surgery, chemotherapy and Raiotherapy. How high is the risk on me having developed cancer of the blood or bone. I have tried to speak to the Haematology department to get some reassurance but have been told noone will talk to me.","Doctor":"Dear Madam, I am pretty much worried about the low platelet counts that you have and bruises the you are developing. There are several causes for this problem, but as you were earlier treated with chemotherapy and radiation, there is high probability that you may be have a blood cancer or a precursor of cancer (we call this condition as therapy related Acute myeloid leukemia/ Myelodysplastic syndrome). Risk of developing this problem depends on type of chemotherapy agents used during the prior treatment and dose of radiation. Hence exact figures cannot be given and it is not necessary also. I suggest you to get your bone marrow tested at the earliest to know the reason for low platelet counts and also get admitted for platelet transfusions. Remember that blood cancers can be treated and with proper treatment many get completely cured of disease. Hope I have answered your question. If you have any further questions I will be happy to help. With regards, Dr. Girish Kamat"},{"Patient":"I was severely anemic due to fibroids. Was transfused 2 units of blood. Had a hysterectomy in June. Am currently taking iron once a day. My H&H is normal and my ferritin level is now a low normal I think about 31, iron studies are normal. How long should I continue taking iron for? I feel really good when I take it; energy levels increased almost overnight when I resumed taking it again (I had stopped due to post-op sluggish bowel/constipation). I m afraid now that I m not getting my period, I may be taking too much iron; am afraid of overdosing.","Doctor":"Dear madam, Duration for which iron supplementation should be given is not clear in any of the recommendations. But it is very clear that, after hemoglobin is normalized iron supplementation should be continued for certain duration, to refill our iron stores. Generally hemoglobin level normalizes after 2 months of starting therapy. I give iron supplementation for a total duration of 6 months for all my patients. I do not monitor ferritin levels or iron profile. Lack of having periods is certainly not due to iron overload, but it is because, your uterus has been removed as you had multiple fibroids. So don't worry of about not having periods. Hope I have answered your question. If you have any further questions I will be happy to help.

Subclinical viral infection or many other infection can lead to low platelets count. Low iron level does not cause low platelets count.

I've been tired lately and am now wondering if I should ignore the low count or ask for other things to be checked to make sure there's nothing serious going on?","Doctor":"Hello,So far as your question is concerned, a bit information about your health history and current status (including drug history) may be needed to reach to a conclusion. Keeping in view the information you provided, if you are not having other illnesses, especially infections and you are not taking any long-term medication and are not having any serious health problem(s) due to low WBC count (frequent and severe infections), then you can just ignore it. But you may need to get the blood counts done regularly at least on 6 monthly basis so that if further decline occurs, it can be timely picked up and managed accordingly.Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further.Regards,Dr. Imran Ahmed Khan"},{"Patient":"I have been scheduled for a chest ct scan due to elevated a d-dimer level of 512.

I am an airline pilot and he wants to make sure that I am not at a higher risk of anything.  My wife is a nurse and I can tell she is concerned about my elevated d-dimer level.  What do you think?","Doctor":"Hello,So far your question is concerned a bit more knowledge about history and examination may be needed to reach a conclusive diagnosis. Keeping in view the provided information (age factor, pilot by occupation, overweight), it seems that you probably are at an increased risk of developing deep vein thrombosis and consequent pulmonary embolism. Sometimes, small and transient episodes of pulmonary embolism may go unnoticed. Still it may be there and can be evidenced by elevated D-dimer levels. So my suggestion at the moment is not to ignore these lab findings and consult a coagulation specialist/hematologist near you and get yourself thoroughly evaluated and examined to exclude the possibility of any serious pathology and to manage it as early as possible if something turns out to be there.Hope I have answered your query.

But during the process of donating blood or blood products it is the safety of the donor that is of prime importance. As you have mentioned that your hematocrit is increased, it shows that there is relative reduction in the plasma volume in the blood and upon further donating the plasma, the problem may be aggravated. As the rule excess of everything is injurious so is for the hematocrit, and its increased levels can cause the increased risk of multiple illnesses including heart disease and stroke.So for your safety, it is better to refrain from plasma donation if your hematocrit is high. Alternatively, you can discuss about the possibility of donating the packed red blood cells with your primary physician.Hope I have answered your query.

The problem is not only the creatinine but the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) which is bound to be low in his case considering his age.

My kidney ultrasound showed no blocked. Have I sustained any permanent damage. How should I manage my diet. I am a cycling enthusiast and engage in intense exercise.","Doctor":"Thank you for your query.Creatine is found mainly in Muscles. Creatinine is a metabolic product of Creatine.Creatinine is removed from the body mainly by the Kidneys. For this reason, it has been used as an indirect marker for assessing renal function.Normally, an increase in creatinine above the normal range would indicate a reduction in the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) of the kidneys functional units. The GFR determines, how effective the kidney is removing metabolites and maintaining homeostasis.For, sedentary to moderately active individuals, the usual lab values provide a good reference.However in athletes with more muscle mass compared to the non atheletic people, there is more creatinine in the blood to start with and may not necessarily indicate a decline in renal function.Diet rich in animal protein , protein or creatin supplements, certain medications can all increase the level of creatinine in the body ( either directly or by reducing its excretion at the kidney level).Serial serum creatinine levels and monitoring of other renal parameters will help to determine if you have a reason to worry.Try to eat a well balanced meal and get all your nutrition from natural products rather than concentrated forms. hydrate yourself adequately.If you are on any medications, consult your doctor to see if it contributes to the elevated levels.Go for routine checks and monitor closely. If you have diabetes, hypertension or high cholesterol levels, risk of kidney damage is present. Early detection will help prevent progression.

BPH of size 68 grams with vesical stone of size 37 mm. Last month he was attacked by hydronephrosis with UTI and his creatinine was 3.1 which was reduced to 1.7 after 30 days by inserting foley catheter. After 30 days his renal DTPA scan revealed that “markedly reduced blood flow to both kidneys scintigraphically. The cortical phase images show markedly reduced tracer uptake in both kidneys. The delayed images show minimal clearance of tracer from both the kidneys in response to Lasix stress.” Right Kidney GFR 15.7ml/min 42% Left kidney GFR 21.5 ml/min 58% after next 15 days creatinine was reduced to 1.2mg/dl and BUN was normal (before surgery). then doctor performed open surgery to remove stone.after surgery he was attacked by chest infection with wheezing cough and mucus.father was feeling so weakness even cannot sit. after 15 days of surgery he can walk and go washroom to pass stool but cathete is still inserted due to weakness. after 1 month of surgery last day father labs reports are these. serum urea is normal but his creatinine is elevated slightly 1.4mg/dl. his urine is cloudy with pus cells many 300 HPF, red cells 20-25 HPF and epithelial cells are a few. crystals are amorphous urates+ and protein is + question is why his creatinine elevated again? is thats because of UTI? he is taking medicine cefspan 400mg tablet daily since after surgery prescribe by Doctor.","Doctor":"As the age advances, the kidney function also will gradually diminish. After age of 65 years, kidney function will be reduced by 1/3 rd. Further, your father's UTI and BPH might also aggravate deterioration of kidney function.

It is  thick white yellowish  color most of the time . is mainly experienced during puberty, when sexual organs are developing in a woman.

Some of the most common causes are  Anemia and Hormonal disturbances and  increase in the levels of toxins in the body and poor eating habits .Modification in your life style and food habits  -including regular  exercise ,yoga , pranayam and meditation for proper blood circulation  and  balanced  diet having essential nutrients  - fiber , Vitamins ,minerals antyoxidants  in natural form - lemon  juice , turmeric powder , honey , aloe vera juice , amla  regular intake will help  gain heallth in 6 months .All the best"},{"Patient":"I recently had a CBC w/ Differentials done.

The doctors told me to u need to get checked out but I refused because no ins. And started feeling better with in 10 minutes. What would cause a sudden drop in blood pressure? Then go back to normal with in minutes?","Doctor":"Hi welcome to HCM Sudden drop in BP has many possible causes, from lifestyle choices, to medication or an underlying health condition. Sudden fall in blood pressure also can be dangerous and  can cause dizziness and fainting when the brain fails to receive an adequate supply of blood. Even mild dehydration can cause weakness, dizziness and fatigue . A lack of the vitamins B-12  cause a condition in which your body doesn't produce enough red blood cells , causing low blood pressure.Drink more water. Alcohol is dehydrating and can lower blood pressure . Water, on the other hand, combats dehydration and increases blood volume.Follow a healthy diet. Get all the nutrients you need for good health by focusing on a variety of foods, including whole grains, fruits, vegetables, and lean chicken and fish. Use more salt but if you don't like a lot of salt on your food, try using natural soy sauce or adding dry soup mixes to dips and dressings.Go slowly when changing body positions. You may be able to reduce the dizziness and lightheadedness that occur with low blood pressure on standing by taking it easy when you move from a prone to a standing position.Before getting out of bed in the morning, breathe deeply for a few minutes and then slowly sit up before standing. Sleeping with the head of your bed slightly elevated also can help fight the effects of gravity.If you begin to get symptoms while standing, cross your thighs in a scissors fashion and squeeze, or put one foot on a ledge or chair and lean as far forward as possible. These maneuvers encourage blood to flow from your legs to your heart. Practise swift walk , jogging , Deep Breathing Inhale - Hold - Exhale - Hold , Kapalbhati , Bhramari Omkarnad  with a traned guide .Eat small, low-carb meals. To help prevent blood pressure from dropping sharply after meals, eat small portions several times a day  Take a cup of hot milk with a spoon of honey and almond oil at bed time .and any time you feel low . A palm full of nuts twice a day  also help .Your doctor also may recommend drinking  coffee or tea with meals to temporarily raise blood pressure. But because caffeine can cause other problems, check with your doctor before drinking more caffeinated beverages.Hope this helps solves your query .Take care , All the best .Don't hesitate to get back if have any further query"},{"Patient":"i had blood work done and my liver enzyme were 80, so I retook the blood test and it were 60.

The pain seems to subside only after drinking water, and gets worse (more painful) after drinking tea or fruit juices.","Doctor":"Hi welcome to HCM.Lower abdominal dull pain in your case can be most probably be secondary to renal calculi disease. This can occasionally be relieved through intake of water which can flush out minor stones from the urinary tract. I strongly recommend you to have a detailed renal ultrasound to document the location of stones. I recommend you to increase the intake of water to 3-4 litres /day. The definitive management  would be extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy-ESWL and PCNL-percutaneous nephrolithotomy. Avoid intake of foods like spinach and tomato .Consult your urologist for further queries.Thank you."},{"Patient":"My mother is 65 yes old.her creatinine in blood is1.42 mg/dl tested on 9th September-2015..blood sugar PP-107.0 mg/dl and fasting 82.0mg/dl ..what is the problem and how it is recovery..my mother is also an ostio arthritis patient..Which department doctor may I consult...","Doctor":"Thank you for contacting HCM. your mother's blood sugars are excellent. fasting sugars should be less than 100 and post Prondial less than 200 and she is having good sugar control accruing to the information you have provided to us. does your mother have diabetes ? if these tests are done for screening and I do not think she has diabetes. her sugars are excellent as mentioned above, they are falling within the limits. your mother's creatinine is elevated little bit. is this the first time she had these tests done or do have a prior reading. some times we see a condition called chronic kidney disease (CKD) where persons creatinine tends up even with the age. high blood pressures and diabetes certainly worsens the creatinine and thus CKD more quickly.

I was being seeing a Pain Management Center in AZ (im now in a small town in CA) where they prescribed meds to help control th pain whie i sought treatment elsewhere looking for some possible cure for my necrosis. Not really happening at this point. Back to today.. I had been seeing a Pain Specialist here for a few years but he doesnt accept MediCal that i have being on SSI. I sought out a GP Dr when i was having a hard time keeping up with th Dr visit charges (which i now regret immensely). These new regular Dr are EXTREMELY against fastacting pain meds etc. 7 yrs ago or so, my Dr in AZ talked me into 12 Kadians (morphine) assuring me that detoxing with him would be painless IF and WHEN we found some cure for my Necrosis. Ive been on Kadian eve since with Oxycodone for breakthru pain. My newest Dr refuses to prescribe fastacting pain meds swearing that they cause your pain tolerance to be lowered constantly to th point where i ll never be able to have real pain relief. Two times while on Kadian 60mg every 12 hours i accidentally missed a dose or 2 and ended up in an ER with pain so extreme, vomiting uncontrollably etc (we concluded that i was goin thru withdrawals). Now this new Dr wants only to increase my Kadian and quickly. In the past few months from 60mg to 80mg every 12 hrs. With not very good results so shes prescribed me uot to 100mg every 12 hrs plus Kadian 60mg for breakthru between my 12 hr meds. Needless to say that i am SCARED TO DEATH about these doses!So far i have begun thje 100mg every 12hrs and added 20mg up to 6 daily = 320mg supposed to lead up to (next week) 560mg per day. This seems crazy considering how badly i thought i was dying previously when i missed doses. AND im stil in pain to th point that i now feel like a cripple for the first time in my life. i often cry from th pain, limp and am in pretty much constant pain. My mother dioesnt get it all but believes this new Dr that fastacting meds will never be the answer and thats is her adament opinion (to the point where she called my previous Pain Management Dr crazy TWICE and rt to my face! I really just want to go back to my REAL Pain Dr and go back to much lower Kadian dose with my fastacting Oxycodones. Whats your opinin on this please? not sure if i can add to this but im supposed to tell you im a 49 yr old female, 5 8, 140 pounds, as active as i CAN be but am not, hope that helps...","Doctor":"Hi,From your description I understand that you are in chronic pain. I presume that your blood sugar levels and metabolic profile are ok.If these tests have not been done please do get them done as well. Has your Vitamin D level test been done. If not you may get your Vitamin D level tested. If this is low then you may need adequate supplementation. I would suggest that in addition to your doctors prescriptions you may see a well qualified accupressure specialist. Accupressure is an alternative branch of medicine which is complementary to your pain medication.It does not cure the medical problem but may help some people in reducing their pan symptoms.Over time some patients report a sense of overall well being and decreased use of pain medications with accupressure.You may also find out if there are biofeedback type of sessions at your pain management clinic.Biofeedback is also a type of additional therapy used to manage some forms of chronic pain. You may also try meditation techniques as available on About.com or Deepak Chopras websites or any good meditation centre .Mediation works by helping to calm our anxieties and creates a sense of well being which induces a sense of positivity which helps us in coping with the chronic pain. Chronic pain ,i understand reduces the quality of our life and creates a sense of misery and anxiety and that is why in addition to the usual medications ,we should also work on addressing our state of overall well being by meditation exercises such as focused breathing techniques, visualization etc . Accupressure also may be helpful but must be done under the advice of a skilled practitioner. You may also try to consume anti oxidant containing food and beverages such as green tea, berries etc if you are not allergic to them or have no other contraindications. A well balanced diet with more natural food, whole grains and vegetables promotes a sense of well being. You may try to reduce the consumption of food that contains too many preservatives, coloring and additives etc. Since you said that you are an active person,I presume that you are able to do some light aerobic exercises when possible but please do not do any exercises when you are in pain. Should you require further guidance please post your lab reports and doctors diagnosis with details here so that I provide you with more information. Warmest regards and wishing you a pain free and healthy life"},{"Patient":"I love travelling but the last 5 years I have started to get problems with my stomach. i have been to a docter and she said that i have a inbalance on my stomach.

You seem to have disordered stomach motility leading to process of indigestion and dyspepsia. This can be controlled or prevented with the help of low fat high protein diet preferably liquid diet should be adhered to while travelling. In case of relapses of such symptoms I advise you to have an ultrasound of your abdomen to rule out organic pathology. In most cases symptoms resolve by itself. Drugs like proton pump inhibitors and prokinetics will be pretty helpful to improve your symptoms. Avoid junk food whenever possible. Bedtime oatmeal will help to soothe your gut. Drink plenty of water before your flight travel to avoid bloating sensation.

What is the proper procedure for taking my blood pressure?Thank you,","Doctor":"Hi welcome to HCM Dear ,You may need to take your BP at home if have hypertension (high BP) or hypotension (low BP). High BP increases your risk for stroke, heart attack, or kidney disease. Low BP may cause you to feel dizzy or like you are going to pass out. This usually happens when you stand up quickly. You may need to take medicine to keep your BP at a normal level . Start the procedure with few do's and dont's  for accurate reading Do not check your blood pressure within 30 minutes of smoking, drinking coffee, or exercising. These may affect your BP reading.Do not take a BP reading in an arm that is injured or has an IV or a shunt.Sit and rest for 5 minutes before you take your BP. Extend your arm and support it on a flat surface. Your arm should be at the same level as your heart. Both of your feet should be flat on the floor.The device has a built-in pump that inflates the cuff. Put the cuff about 1 inch (2.5 cm) above your elbow. Wrap the cuff snugly around your arm. The BP reading may not be correct if the cuff is too loose.Turn on the BP monitor and follow the directions.Write down your BP, the date, the time, and which arm you used to take the BP. If possible, take your blood pressure twice and write down both readings. These BP readings can be 1 minute apart. Let the air out of the cuff. Turn off the monitor and take off the BP cuff.Take your BP at least twice a day. Take your BP at the same times each day, such as the morning and evening for accurate reading .

I was born in 1960...the third of three daughters. My mother is negative blood type...my sisters and I all positive blood type. Her pregnancy with me was non-thriving and suspicious. I was induced a few weeks early as a result. I had a non-thriving look. In later decades it was learned that my mother was RH negative, and each subsequent pregnancy became dangerous to the fetus (me). I know that I did not undergo a blood transfusion after birth. I am 50 years old now, and have been undergoing blood work and endless doctor appointments to find answers to a multitude of symptoms....all pointing to autoimmune disorders.

I exhibit symtoms of either Multiple Sclerosis, or Lupus, or anything at all...but nothing conclusive shows in blood work or MRI s from 2009. I was a little anemic in my twenties, but no longer.

Is there any such thing as being vulnerable for disease for those babies that were contaminated by the RH factor? Thank you so much.......Randie Lucano","Doctor":"Dear Randie. I will address the issue of being prone for autoimmune disease first. Research evidence shows that there is a connection with HLA types that is there maybe a genetic predisposition in some families. Regarding the Rh blood group, inconclusive evidence. Prior to the development of The Rh immunoglobulin Rhnegative moms of the 60s and 70s did not receive it. Not all Rhnegative moms mounted an immune response so in that case the babies were OK or else they didn't survive or had serious problems. For a diagnosis of lupus we have certain criteria which is a minimum of four criteria called ACR criteria. ANA positivity is one of them . Along with the patient has a rash on the cheeks, joint pain, anemia, kidney problems etc. Lupus has different levels of severity and requires assessment by an immunologist. Sometimes lupus may be associated with other autoimmune diseases. If you were diagnosed with Lupus by an immunologist or rheumatologist, you have to periodically go in for a check up. There is effective modern therapy for autoimmune diseases if present and the quality of life is generally good with effective medical monitoring.

The test has been done through Ranbaxy. He is 63 yrs old and overweight. The wight is approx. 95 kgs. The major problem in his case is that he loses balance while walking, forget driving. This has virtually happened over-night and before this he was perfectly fine to the extent that he could drive a scooter and car also upto 600 kms with-out a break. He has high blood presassure and also has been diagnosed as high in uric acid. Doctor has also told us that there is no cure for this. The medicines or any other therapy is only preventive so that the problem does not increases but besides that, he has to live with the problem. He is living in Jammu (j&k), living on the first floor. Doctor has also suggested him not to climb the stairs, so basically he is house arrested since last 20 days and has only gone out while his visit to the doctor. We are thinking on the lines of changing the house also in 1-2 months if the same scene continues. As per the doctor this is a neurological problem which is not curable, however with the medicine this may not increase. Beyond this, the doctor has not explained much. The diagnosis has been done by a neuro-physician. Also the other tests performed like the CT scan, chest x-ray and other blood tests inclusive of the Acetycholine receptor autoantibodies are all normal so that is a positive indication as per the doctor. The medicines suggested are :Evion LC (1 daily after dinner) Cap. Rejunex (1 daily after dinner) and Tab. Adesam-200 (1 after breakfast and 1 after dinner.

EGD and colonoscopy showed nothing, and Hemoccult negative for occult blood x2 separate occasions. I have been on p.o. iron for 5 months (serum feritin was 3 in nov 2010 and mar 2011 was 7). Also, celiac sprue panel negative. Hgb 13.8. All other blood tests and serum chemistry are normal. U/A was negative for blood. Retic count 2.5%. I have also had a couple of night sweats, spleen was 12 cm in 11/2010 and 14.5 cm in 2/2011, also I have 2 cervical lymph nodes (about 1cm each) enlarged just above clavicle. They are painless, but non-fixed and have been enlarged for about 8 weeks but have not increased in size. I have had no recent illnesses, except for strep throat in 12/2010 and glomerulonephritis shortly after that. I also have very bad exertional dyspnea since about october, to the point where I'm SOB after 2-3 minutes of minimal exercise (and i've been taking tae kwon do for 2 yrs without any trouble unitl recently). I also am extremely tired recently (I used to operate on about 5 hrs sleep/night and am now sleeping 12-15 hrs/day). I have never had any anemia or iron deficiency before. I have no family hx of blood cancers; however, my maternal grandmother had stage 4 breast cancer at 31 y/o and stage 2 breast cancer (which was unrelated to the first cancer) at 40 y/o. No family hx of iron absorption dz. My hematologist recommended IV iron dextran 1x per month x 4 months.

I presume that you have had a peripheral blood smear evaluated by a hematopathologist. If not then peripheral blood smear examination is necessary. If you have not done certain tests such as TSH thyroid stimulating  hormone test you may also get that done. Based on your description your condition appears to be iron deficiency anemia. The exertional breathless sensation may be a symptom of anemia. However as anemia is uncommon in a young male further work up is necessary especially that of your lymph node. A second opinion from a hematologist is prudent to exclude the possibility of a condition called lymphoma of your lymph node . Though it is a rare possibility it is prudent to get a second opinion.

The question you ask stands; Oxazepam is an active metabolite formed during the breakdown of diazepam and certain similar drugs.Urine toxicology reports of daily or frequent diazepam users will most likely indicate the presence of all three metabolites of diazepam: nordazepam, temazepam and oxazepam.As the end product of diazepam metabolism, oxazepam often is present at slightly higher concentrations in the urine than nordiazepam and temazepam. Thus, oxazepam often remains detectable in the urine for a day or two after the other metabolites have been fully eliminated.

A little clarification regarding your mothers blood counts would be appreciated. Does she have a low hemoglobin level or other counts also reduced. If she has a low hemoglobin level she probably has anemia which in this age maybe nutritional. Other causes may also need to be ruled out in old age. A peripheral smear examination may help with pointing us to the cause. For the anemia you may give her iron supplements in the form of tablets or syrup. And an improved diet including green leafy vegetables. As for the bleeding from nose I would advise you to get an ENT consultation to rule out any sttuctural problems in the nose and a condition called atrophic rhinitis. Does she have hypertension or increased blood pressure. Uncontrolled blood pressure may also cause epistaxis and bleeding from the nose.Also is she taking any blood thinning medications or aspirin? They too may cause epistaxis in elderly.I hope this helps you.

Over time my iron level has become lower and I started taking iron supplement. Recently the iron and ferritin levels were below the level that Procrit shots can be given. I had iron infusios and my iron level went down once more and I had another infusion.My concern is that the hematoligist Dr. where I receive the Procrit suspects bleeding. I have had 2 stool sample tests with no signs of blood and I am VERY observant and have seen no blood.My question is --Even though my kidney function is good, can the iron anemia be a result of the PKD? And is there a test to confirm that?Thank you for any help you might give.","Doctor":"I would analyse the cause of anemia based on your MCV, RDW, peripheral blood smear pattern etc. In addition tests such as reticulocyte count, serum ferritin and transferring are also required to find out the cause of your anemia. Usually polycystic kidney produces raised Hemoglobin due to increased erythropietin , however sometimes PKD may cause anemia . This anemia is usually due to declining renal function. However as you have described your renal function as normal I presume that renal function tests such as blood Urea nitrogen and creatinine have been done. Some of the other causes for anemia are anemia due to chronic blood loss. Chronic bleeding into the cysts may cause hematuria or blood in the urine which may be microscopic. To detect this we have to look at the urine report. Should you require more information you may post your complete blood count and hematological profile here for further assistance in  finding out the cause of your anemia.

You may reduce exposure to dust as dust mites are on of the causes of allergies which aggravates this type of asthma. You may use a dust absorbing device on your room and frequently sun dry mattresses and linen along with vacuuming if you have carpets. If your child is allergic to pollen , or cat fur reducing exposure to them is helpful. Regarding diet  a balanced diet with freshly prepared food containing fresh fruits and vegetables is beneficial. Certain ayurvedic supplementary Tonic like preparations such as Chyawanaprash are helpful to boost immunity. This preparation contains herbal components like gooseberry which are beneficial on a long term basis. Outdoor activities which encourage physical well-being are also helpful. Overall it's an all round approach that is managing the environment around to reduce allergies and boosting our own immunity. Probiotics are also helpful in building a good immune system.

Blood in the urine may be gross hematuria which means many red cells in the urine. Gross hematuria can be seen with our eyes as red urine. There is another type called microscopic hematuria where red cells are seen under the microscope. If red cells or red cells casts are present in the urine along with protein in the urine it means there is a kidney problem especially in a structure called glomerulus. Red cells or Frank blood in the urine may occur more commonly due to stones. It may also be seen with certain infections. Above the age of 40 , we also try to rule out the possibility of kidney or bladder cancer. Certain medicines and certain food items may colour the urine red but in this case the urine report is negative for blood or red cells. A condition called myoglobinuria where the muscles are affected may cause red urine. The first step therefore is to read the urine report. Blood in the urine is usually investigated with an ultrasound initially follower by other tests according to the most likely cause.

Also, sometimes when I eat I feel I need to go to the bathroom, and only ended up passing gas (makes me feel better) For the first time, I saw what I think it was a little bit of bright red blood at the end of my stool. I have no pain after eating or before going to the bathroom or after. But, I’m a little concern on what is going on. I checked with my pcp, and she gave some pills for heartburn (runs in the family, bad acid reflux) She asked me a LOT of questions and even checked my belly pressuring everywhere and said everything was fine. But, I don’t feel satisfied. I’m 31 years old, 6-3 280 lbs and honestly don’t have the best eating habits. I work on the road so; I eat in a lot of chain restaurants. I had blood work done two monhs ago to check my liver, and everything came back looking great according to the doctor. Any suggestions or ideas? Thanks","Doctor":"Hi,From history it seems that you might be having acid reflux with likely of having chronic GI infection.You might require one course of ofloxacilin, tinidazole medicine course for 3-5 days.Take Omeprazole type of medicine.Change your food habit.Avoid fried and junk food.For having passing bright red blood at the end of passing stool without pain indicates you might be having internal hemorrhoids.Consult surgeon and get examined.Avoid constipation and take plenty of water.Ok and take care."},{"Patient":"XXXXX I have been diagnosed with Ehlers-Danlos hypermobility type (at age 64). My major features fall within this class. I also have some vascular (blow blood vessels in palms of hands and soles of feet, no philtrim, thin upper lip, thin velvety skin, high palate and very small blood vessels in the medulla oblongata. Don t have other bleeding issues. (Need a 22 butterfly for blood draws and IV s). My genetist glossed over stroke risk. I am guessing it is significantly increased - if so, any idea how much?. ( I have limited info on biological family.) email:","Doctor":"Hello, The type of Ehlers Danlos syndrome that you were diagnosed with is a typeIII, that is the type that generally does not cause much problems in the quality of life provided joints are protected. The type of Ehlers Danlos that has a risk for blood vessel wall weakness leading to aneurysms and strokes is the Type IV and Type VI according to the current evidence base. Therefore you are not at increased risk for these conditions . Your risk for aneurysms or stroke is the same as for any individual . Risk factors for stroke include smoking, increased blood pressure called hypertension, abnormal blood lipids and blood sugar. So rest assured, your type of Ehlers Danlos does not put you at increased risk of blood vessel related problems and the overall quality of life and general life span are not affected. However, do remember to protect your joints and ligaments from injury. Should you require more information on your condition you may post your queries here .Best regards, DrGeetha"},{"Patient":"Hi have broken blood vessels on the back of my hand. They appear as small red dots. My hand was purple at first but that cleared up leaving my hand darker than the other one. Went to dermatologist , he had blood work done but no answer from him yet.","Doctor":"Hi, Based on the information that you have given I would say that the first test we would look at is your platelet count. One of the causes for such red spots is a low platelet count. If your platelet count is OK the other possibility is a fragile or weakened blood vessel . Weakened blood vessels may show up as spots or discolouration etc. Medically this condition is called vasculitis. The possibility of autoimmune disease should also be ruled out . Tests such as ANA are used for this along with clinical findings. Certain medications may also produce such symptoms. Sometimes there is no cause . Please post your complete blood count, ESR, peripheral smear,LFT, ANA lab test reports here for further assistance in providing more information regarding your condition. Best regards."},{"Patient":"Hi... My mom recently got admitted in a hospital because she had breathing trouble with high fever, cough. Later doctors discovered that she had fluid around lungs and a decreased platelet count. They are curing fluid around lungs by way of injection and now by medicines. Mean while platelets count in blood got reduced to 30,000 which should not be the case. So they gave her 6 units of blood in 3 days to make the platelets count to climb up. Platelets reached 80,000. She became normal after that and got discharged from hospital. But now after few days, the platelet count became 40,000 again and suddenly WBC count got increased to 43,000 . Normal range (4,300 to 10,000 i guess). what should do we do now? How to cure completely? She is 48 years of age.","Doctor":"Hello,I had gone through your query and understand your concern.WBC count increases whenever there is infection in the body. As it is evident from your question, your mother had pleural effusion which means collection of fluid around the lungs. There are many reasons for this. I suppose your doctor has sent that fluid for analysis which will help to know the reason behind such fluid accumulation. Once the infection is completly cleared WBC count will come back to normal.It takes time. You need not to do anything for this to happen.Normal platelet count is 1.5 to 4 lakh/mcL. Our body will try to produce more platelets when the count is low. I have seen many cases with platelet count even below 40000 and recovering well without any blood transfusion. Low platelet count will cause bleeding disorders. Keep watching for any bleeding from nose, bleeding in the eye, giddiness. If your mother develops any of these better to take her to an ER. A persistent low platelet count calls for further evaluation. I suggest you to take repeat platelet count. I hope that it will come normal.Take care of your mother.If you have any other queries, feel free to contact me.Regards,Dr. Prathap Kumar"},{"Patient":"l am almost 50 years old female l recently under a lot of stress had some bloods taken am now having vit 12 injections and taking vit d tablets l have lost a lot of weight not felt like eating with the stress my appettie has improved l have a very healthy diet l have numbness and tingling in my hands and feet and a unusal sensenation below the knees l have being diagnosised with raynaud disease some years ago l often feel nauseas and really unusual coppery taste in my mouth l often have foggy feeling l dont drink alcohol very often l am smoker l dont have diabetes or any other known illness","Doctor":"Hi, I would suggest the following tests if they have not been done earlier. Complete blood count, peripheral blood smear, blood Urea serum , liver function tests,creatinine, urine routine examination, lipid profile, thyroid function test, fasting blood sugar., ANA. I presume that you have been prescribed vitamin B12 because your vitamin B12 is low. A deficiency of vitamin B12 and Vitamin D do produce the symptoms you have described but it is also important to rule out Diabetes mellitus and thyroid problems as well hence I have suggested a battery of tests. The Raynaud type of symptoms may have no cause in which case it's idiopathic or it may be secondary to autoimmune diseases . your Vitamin B12 deficiency may be nutritional or immunological such as pernicious anemia . depending on the cause of your vitamin B12 problem you may be treated as a short course of vitamins or life long if it is the pernicious anemia type. If all tests are negative the Raynaud's phenomenon may be alleviated by keeping your feet and hands warm by gloves and socks and also avoiding cold temperature. It is important that you should get your feet examined for loss of pulses and peripheral neuropathy. As a precautionary measure avoid walking barefoot and avoid immersing your limbs in hot or cold water. If your lipid profile shows abnormal values that has to be treated either through dietary modifications for mild values or lipid lowering drugs for higher values. Protection of hands and feet from injury is essential. Smoking aggravates Raynauds. As you have expressed that you do not have diabetes or any known illness i presume that you have done most of the lab tests. If it has been a long time since you had the tests it is prudent to get the tests done now. Should you require further information please post your lab test results and further clarifications here so that I may  assist you in getting all the information that you need.

AND THEN SEVERAL HOURS LATER ABOUT 5 A.M. TAKE THE THYROID MED. IS THERE ANYTHING ELSE i CAN DO AFTER ALMOST 8 YEARS OF TRYING TO GET HIGHER THAN 5.2......","Doctor":"A 5.2 value is alright as far as potassium is concerned. If you are on medications such as diuretics that may be a cause for low potassium.if you also suffer from high blood pressure called hypertension with low potassium values we have to rule out a condition called hyperaldosteronism. For this you have to get a plasma renin and aldosterone test done. Another cause for low potassium also called hypokalemia is that you may be losing potassium through problems within the kidney. To detect this we do tests such as 24 hour urine volume, urine osmolality, urine sodium, urine potassium and chloride. These tests are done in most laboratories. As your current treatment seems to be quite effective you may continue the same. You must be alert to excessive exhaustion and muscle weakness because they are symptoms of low potassium. A very low potassium can affect the heart so you should vperiodically get the potassium tested. A very high potassium is also dangerous so do not exceed the prescribed medications. From the point of view of dietary modifications, fruits contain potassium especially fruits such as bananas so that's a natural way of getting our daily requirements. However overconsumption of fruits is not recommended if you are diabetic or have any kidney ailments. Should you require more information about your query please feel free to post them here and I would be happy to assist you in acquiring more information.

My Docter said you don t have any complain. So it s okay. But this happen after I my saw my docter, now I m worried.","Doctor":"Hello, I will address your primary concern about the spitting of blood first. One of the causes could be a condition called bronchitis which is a type of inflammation of the lining of our large breathing tube or bronchus. This condition is usually viral and may show slightly higher lymphocytes on your blood count. Blood in the sputum or spit may also arise from the inflammation of the lining of the nose. These conditions are not serious and resolves. However one should also know that blood in the sputum can arise from tuberculosis or  cancer type diseases also which from your description does not appear to be the cause. However , my advice is that you should get a test called peripheral blood smear done . you must also obtain your test report on absolute lymphocyte count. Persistently raised lymphocyte count has to be investigated with additional tests such as flow cytometry and bone marrow biopsy. At the moment bone marrow biopsy is not necessary but you must get a peripheral blood smear examination done by a pathologist along with an absolute lymphocyte count done. You may also feel for any lumps in your neck and armpit . if there are any you must get investigated by a physician promptly. I presume that your platelet count is OK because low platelets can cause bleeding . Overall my opinion is that your blood in the sputum may be a temporary phenomenon as you recover from a viral or allergy related illness but it is important to also get some investigations done. Therefore please get the following investigations:Peripheral blood smear with absolute lymphocyte countSputum examination with cytologyChest XRayPlease feel free to clarify your test results alsoBest regards"},{"Patient":"I was recently diagnosed with high blood calcium (10.8, three separate blood tests done), with normal PTH and very low vitamin D.

What should my next step be?","Doctor":"You may get the following tests done- Ionized calcium level( Ionized calcium level is a different test from the total calcium level that you have given here). You may also get as serum phosphorus , blood urea , serum creatinine ,ESR test done. From the information provided your high calcium also called hypercalcemia is in the mild range. As your PTH is normal , a condition called hyperparathyroidism which can cause high calcium is ruled out.As your Vitamin D is low it is essential to continue with your vitamin D as prescribed because low Vitamin D affects your bones and several other metabolic processes.High calcium may occur non specifically if you are taking medicines called thiazides which are prescribed for conditions such as high blood pressure etc. Some of the other causes of high calcium are hyperparathyroidism which is ruled out in your case because the PTH is ok. Rarely high calcium levels are seen in people with certain cancers of the lung, bones etc. You may get the tests done and post your detailed queries here for further information.

My Cholesterol was 299 this past March. I have varicose veins in my right leg for a long time with no real problems or irritation. Last Thursday (12-8) I took 60mg vyvanse at 7:30am to help study. I ve taken it before with no problems besides the normal side effects. Loss of appetite, some insomnia b/c of the time I took, and dry mouth. I am not prescribed the vyvanse. I got it from a friend. I know I shouldn t do that but I did. When I took the vyvanse this past Thursday, I had a little pain in my calf where I have a varicose vein. Didn t think much of it. Friday 12-9, I worked and went out for my b-day. I felt the same pain in the calf when walking at work. Didn t feel the pain Friday night probably due to the alcohol I drank. Saturday I could feel the pain in my calf and also to my inner thigh about 2 inches above the knee where more varicose veins are. When I don t move my leg I feel no pain, When I get up and start walking I feel it like a sore muscle but after moving around its little pain. I played volleyball Saturday night 12-10. Between games I am sitting waiting for the next game. I get up to play and I feel sore from calf to thigh but when playing and moving around I m fine. Sunday was the worse pain.Both calves, shoulder and arms were sore due to being inactive and then playing volleyball. While sitting down at work I felt the pain a little but when I get up to walk, I was limping until I walked it off. All the pain radiated from the varicose vein in my calf to my varicose vein on my inner thigh. It was sore to the touch by the veins. No real redness by the veins. Monday same thing but not as bad as Sunday. Tuesday, was a little sore but not so much in my calf where it originally started. barely any pain to the touch on my calf. My inner thigh is where I still feel the pain. Sensitive to the touch by the varicose vein. No real redness. Most pain just like I mentioned above is from sitting to getting up and walking around. Do you think the vayvanse broke off a blood clot and it is slowly making its way through my varicose veins back to my lungs and or heart?","Doctor":"Hello, First of all please stop taking the Vyvanse. One of its side effects is muscle pain as you have described. It is a drug that should not be taken unless specifically prescribed by a physician. Regarding the worry about blood clots as you have expressed , blood clots in varicose veins rarely travel to the heart because varicose veins are superficial veins. The problem of a blood clot breaking and travelling upwards to the lung and heart which we call as pulmonary embolism in medical terms arises due to a blood clot or thrombus in the deep veins of the lower limb. One must remember that while varicose veins as such are not dangerous, deep leg vein clots called deep vein thrombosis in the leg is dangerous. Deep vein thrombosis can present as calf pain with an increase in size of the affected limb etc. This condition is investigated using tests such a Doppler test and D-Dimer test. Please get the following tests done- Complete blood count, creatinine kinase, Doppler test of the lower limb, CT pulmonary angiography . Some pulmonary emboli may be clinically silent , however some may cause sudden death. Since your cholesterol levels are high ,I presume that you are managing it under medical supervision. You may get a more detailed lipid profile assessment which includes LDL, HDL, apolipoproteins, hs CRP  etc. However , the most important step is to exclude deep vein thrombosis in your case even though that is a rare possibility here because deep vein thrombosis usually occurs in people who have had prolonged bed rest, after surgery/trauma, certain cancers, certain rare inherited disorders which cause the blood to clot inappropriately etc. Best regards"},{"Patient":"What should I expect to happen to me if shoot up old blood?

Inflammatory bowel disease is mainly of two types either Crohn or Ulcerative COLITIS. You may consult a gastroenterologist to exclude the possibility of inflammatory bowel disease which is often difficult to detect in the initial stages and presents with vague symptoms and intermittent bloody diarrhea.

This medication works by inhibiting an enzyme which therefore reduces the buildup of the problematic lipid substance in the cells. That's a simple  way of saying it. Dosage given in some studies is 200 mg orally thrice a day. Effect takes time but seems to be OK. This medicine should be prescribed and taken only if your physician tells you to do so because there are side effects and interactions. Monitoring is also necessary.

For the last few yrs I have experienced missed heart beats which often happen as I m falling asleep, which cause me to wake suddenly, gasping for breath and recently coughing . I also have a first degree heart block. Should I have these episodes investigated. They are very alarming when they occur! Thank you.","Doctor":"Hi, Yes any disorder which presents as missed heart beats and or gasping etc must be investigated. Abnormal rhythms in the heart are called arrhythmia which may be detected using tests such as ECG. Abnormal rhythms may be dangerous if not detected . You also require a cardiac evaluation with tests such as Echocardiogram etc. Imaging of the chest with CT scanning is also necessary to detect any lung or chest problems. I presume that you may be taking medications for your heart block so any symptoms that make you uncomfortable require investigation and consultation with a cardiologist.I presume that your blood pressure is ok. You may also get a complete blood count done. Both lung and heart conditions have to be ruled out with the symptoms that you have described."},{"Patient":"Thanks. I was finally diagnosed 7 yrs. ago with Lupus from a Bone Marrow Biopsy. I now have Mixed Connective tissue disease, with a spectrum of choices. My blood has feel affected for almost 10 yrs., however now it s traveling thru my organs. I ve had acute chronic pancreatitus for 3 yrs., High Blood pressure & heart rate for 4 yrs., now I have Lupus scaring my lungs & a blockage in my Lungs. (I also have a thyroid nodule which I m not concerned about.) I just notice from my rehmy drs. paperwork today that I tested positive for myalgia & myositis. My question is that in Jan, I tested positive anti RNP and leukopenia. What is that? Oh I also have Ostopenia & RA.","Doctor":"Hi, I will answer your first question which is about RNP. RNP is ribonucleoprotein. Antibodies against RNP are suggestive of a disease called Mixed connective tissue disease. To put it simply this is a group of diseases where the normal immune system of the body which in health protects us, now starts to attack us . This is called immune mediated disease . There are Five major diffuse connective tissue diseases : systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE); scleroderma (Scl); polymyositis (PM); dermatomyositis (DM); and rheumatoid arthritis (RA). A sixth disorder, Sjögren’s syndrome. Mixed connective tissue disease has a combination of the above. Regarding your leukopenia, this means that your white blood cell count is low. This is also a feature of the above immune mediated disorders. You may get a complete blood count and peripheral smear done along with blood sugar, urea and creatinine,Liver function tests. It is important to follow up the status of your kidneys as Lupus is known to affect kidneys also. Regular follow up is essential with an immunologist. There are several methods of treatment based on the severity of the disease process. Treatment includes short courses of oral corticosteroids. severe disease requires immunosuppressive drugs such as azathioprine . Therefore my advice is to get a review with an immunologist or rheumatologist with the tests that you have done. I presume that you done many tests already. Mixed connective tissue disease involves different types of immunological diseases such as polymyositis, lupus, etc . It is called an overlap connective tissue disease. What is important that you must get a regular follow up and medication according to the severity of your disease. There are several new drugs available and these diseases are manageable.. It is important to keep a positive outlook as this improves your overall sense of well being and your ability to cope and manage life effectively.

The sub-fraction of VLDL known as VLDL3 is the densest form of VLDL and increases your risk for heart disease, blood clots and diabetes.Again LDL density pattern B increases the risk of atherosclerosis and subsequent heart disease.The protective role of total HDL against CAD is mainly mediated through HDL2 fraction, which in your case is low. therefore your lipid profile results are abnormal, and consultation with a cardiologist is a must."},{"Patient":"I have high blood cells count ... leukocytes 15.000 while the normal is up till 11.000 and after making the CRP test .. the results are negative what can be the causes of this high count of leukocytes !!

When the ammonia levels become high, Cipro helps get the levels back within the normal range.","Doctor":"Blood ammonia comes primarily from the bacterial breakdown of unabsorbed dietary protein in the intestine. Intestinal ammonia passes into the bloodstream and travels to the liver, which converts ammonia into urea. Urea subsequently passes from the body through the urine. High blood ammonia levels can occur with various forms of chronic liver disease, acute liver failure and gastrointestinal bleeding( any condition that increase protein in the gut)"},{"Patient":"My platelet count is 80,000 and has decreased from 160,000 in the past year. Hemotologist just wants to monitor every two months. I had a bone barrow test one year ago. No findings although he said he did not get a good sample. Did not want to repeat. Should I be concerned and seek a second opinion? Recently have had more difficulty with small cuts bleeding more than usual. Thank you.","Doctor":"Hi, This condition of decreased platelets is called thrombocytopenia in medical terms. Decreased platelet count may have several causes such as drug induced , immunological causes, HIV infection etc. From the description that you have given your condition appears to be adult ITP ( IMMUNE THROMBOCYTOPENIA ). It occurs due to molecules called autoantibodies on the platelets surface which destroys the platelets. Autoantibodies  in simple terms is like an army that attacks the people of its own country. I would suggest that you get a peripheral smear evaluated along with your complete blood count by a hematopathologist. You may also get a Coomb's test done to find out if there are other immunological problems that are getting your platelet count down. I presume that your initial work up would have also included HIV testing as HIV can also cause low platelet count. However in your case this does not appear to be the cause. The most important advice I would give is to monitor your platelet count regularly. Repeating the bone marrow test is not necessary for ITP as the problem is not in the marrow. If the platelet count falls below 50, 000/ cu.mm then your doctor should be notified. Platelet counts below 20,000 have a risk for causing bleeding within the brain. Adults with platelet counts >50,000/mm3 do not require treatment. Treatment is indicated for adults with counts < 50,000/mm3 with significant mucous membrane bleeding. Treatment also is indicated for those adults with risk factors for bleeding (eg, hypertension, peptic ulcer disease, vigorous lifestyle) and in patients with a platelet count < 20,000-30,000/mm3. If your platelet count falls to a very critical range your hematologist may treat you with medication such as glucocorticoids, IVIg immunoglobulin or newer drugs. However as your platelet count at the moment is not critical what is usually done is to monitor the platelet count. Because of an increased risk for bleeding aspirin products also should be avoided. Some adult patients with ITP slowly recover over time whereas some have a fall in their platelet count which requires treatment if it is very low. So please continue monitoring your platelet count as before .Best regards."},{"Patient":"hello, I was recently hospitalized with e.coli poisoning in my blood.

The possibility of drug- induced nephritis also has to be ruled out. Nephritis is an inflammation of the kidneys. The other condition is more complex. Hence please do the following tests such as urine routine, urine  protein estimation. complete blood count, peripheral smear , blood urea , serum creatinine. Your blood pressure also has to be checked. You are not overreacting . Your headaches and red spots could be related to inflammation within the kidneys which has to be checked. High blood pressure as a result of nephritis may cause headaches. Nephritis may develop after certain  infections  and sometimes after certain medications .

Since she has been with us she has had no alcohol at all. And eats 3 meals a day, versus nibbling at home. Could the stop pf drinking the alcohol raise her levels ?","Doctor":"Raised potassium levels may have many reasons. One of them could be medications such as potassium sparing diuretics such as spironolactone , amiloride etc. The others are kidney problems, endocrine problems etc. High potassium levels are dangerous to the heart and it is important to find out the cause of the raised level. I suggest the following tests: Serum sodium, serum cortisol, serum ACTH, Blood urea, serum creatinine and complete blood count. Please repeat the potassium level again. I presume that your mother in law is not on any medication. If she is and her potassium levels are high you should consult a doctor to find out if there is any medication that is causing high potassium levels. If it is so then that medicine has to be stopped. High potassium values affect the heart and cause problems in the rhythm leading to dangerous abnormal heart beats which can be life threatening .  Since her potassium levels are high fruits, tender coconut water etc should also be avoided as they are high in potassium. Alcohol consumption usually raises liver enzymes and are not directly related to potassium.

I was recently diagnosed accidentally with a high homcystine level which make me concerned that all I do is not being absorbed. Could I have a digestice enzyme deficiency and a betaine deficiency. If so, what test should I have my doctor do.","Doctor":"Hi, One of the causes of a raised homocysteine level is Vitamin B12 deficiency . Raised homocysteine levels are also a risk factor for diseases such as heart attack ( medically called myocardial infarction) , stroke etc. In fact a rise in homocysteine levels detects even early phases of Vitamin B12 deficiency. As you have been diagnosed with Hashimoto's disease  which is an immune mediated disease you may be prone to develop immune mediated diseases in other organs as well. An immune mediated disease is one where certain molecules called autoantibodies attacks  its own cells and tissues . There is a possibility that you may have a condition called PERNICIOUS ANEMIA which is known to occur in some patients with Hashimotos. Pernicious anemia is  a common cause of B12 deficiency. A protein called intrinsic factor, made by parietal cells that line the stomach, is needed for B12 absorption. In pernicious anemia, inflammation damages the parietal cells, leading to little or no intrinsic factor, thus preventing the intestines from absorbing B12.I would advise you to do the following tests Intrinsic factor antibody testParietal cell antibody testIf any of these tests are positive then there is the possibility that you also have PERNICIOUS ANEMIA. In addition to this please also do a Fasting blood sugar and Post prandial blood sugar test to detect Diabetes mellitus which may be associated with your condition. All of the above contribute to loss of weight and a feeling of exhaustion. You should also recheck your  THYROID FUNCTION TESTS ( TSH, T3 and T4 ). I presume that you may be taking medication for Hashimotos.You should take life long Vitamin B12 if you have Pernicious anemia.To correct the Vitamin B12 deficiency  due to Pernicious anemia one of the methods is to take  1000 mcg IM/SC  injections once daily for 7 days, then weekly for 1 month, then monthly.There is also a nasal spray option:Nasal spray: 500 mcg (1 spray in 1 nostril) weekly."},{"Patient":"Since i was five years old i have developed multiply symptoms that have affected my life in every way shape and form.

The current evidence base says that for a patient with chronic fatigue syndrome, Antibiotics may be used in patients with elevated immunoglobulin M (IgM) Chlamydia pneumoniae titers. You may try Doxycycline 100 mg twice daily for 7 days and see if that helps you. You may also try  aerobic exercises at a good gym with a motivational instructor. These exercises should be done in a graded manner according to your fitness level. You may start with short brief aerobic sessions for a few minutes and proceed according to your comfort levels. Such exercises build an overall sense of well being and optimism. It is important to keep an optimistic spirit because that helps us to gradually overcome any uncomfortable situation.

Some of the risk factors for deep vein thrombosis are prolonged immobilization , trauma, cancer etc. I would suggest the following tests to find out if there is an underlying cause for your husband's DVT. They are as follows:CBC, chest x-ray, urinalysis, liver enzymes, and serum electrolytes, BUN, creatinine. If a screening colonoscopy has not been done earlier, a screening colonoscopy is also advised. I also suggest Factor V Leiden (FVL) mutation and prothrombin 20210 (PT 20210) mutation tests . These  two tests  are often used together to help diagnose the cause of inappropriate blood clot (thrombus) formation, including deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and/or venous thromboembolism (VTE).Testing for Factor V Leiden and PT 20120 mutations is used to help determine if an individual has inherited a disorder associated with blot clots . There are many research projects gathering evidence about veterans exposed to agent orange and their associated disease. Some studies show that people exposed to agent orange are more prone to develop Diabetes mellitus which over the years puts a person at risk for DVT. The medical literature shows that some individuals exposed to agent orange had developed DVT however more evidence is needed and research work is going on at the CDC and other institutes.

Higher the elemental iron, higher the toxicity but higher the response.So a balance is required. Iron bisglycinate 50 mg bid is a right dose to start with and the best way to measure response is to get a reticulocyte count at 1week after response. it should rise in response to iron therapy. Also iron bisglycinate has 20% w/w elemental iron in it just like ferrous sulfate. It has more bioavailability and known to cause less Gastrointestinal disturbances as compared to ferrous sulfate.I hope this helpsWish you all the best Thank you for choosing healthcaremagic"},{"Patient":"Hi My 33 daughter had a stem cell transplant 16 months ago with a matched donor.

He initially gave aricept, nexito plus and vit b12 tablets for a week...nothing improved","Doctor":"Hello,dementia is a chronic condition that impairs the functional capacity of the patient, causing memory loss and other deficits as the disease progresses. I can't - obviously - explain your father's condition without having examined him but I'm sure the neurologist is more than capable to handle such situations. After dementia becomes evident, you can't expect a great improvement and you can't expect him to get back to normal. The drugs are supposed to improve his functional status but they won't make him normal.Despite that, you should discuss how he's going with the neurologist. The neurologist should re-assess your father and perhaps modify his treatment regimen.Kind Regards!"},{"Patient":"I had a very odd thing happen that has never happened to me before.

Normally I can spend several hours outside at 50 degrees without a coat and without getting cold.  Why did I get so cold at 72 degrees?","Doctor":"Such a phenomenon may have several reasons. If you were not feeling feverish at that time then fever related reasons can be excluded. Sometimes such a sensation of cold may be subjective due to emotional factors. Certain medications may cause this sensation at times.If you feel unusually sensitive to cold and feel that you have been gaining weight or feel sluggish you may get a Thyroid function test done  for example TSH test.

She has been receiving IV fluid and oxygen in ICU and now her sodium as well as calcium is normal but, she hasn t gained consciousness yet. Doctors have done all kinds of tests but they didn t find anything abnormal. She seems to be in pain. She clutches and shakes her right hand every time she feels pain. No response from the left portion of her body. She also opens her eyes and blinks fast several times a day. She had abdomenal pain before she got unconscious. No diagnosis has been made so far.","Doctor":"Dear friend. Do you have a CT scan or MRI report done on your grandmother's brain. Low sodium & calcium can cause problems but does not usually cause a deep level of unconsciousness. Of course it is good that gradually it has been corrected.One of the reasons for unconsciousness at this age is a stroke .This happens either due to a blood clot blocking the blood vessels of the brain so that part of the brain dies which results in a lack of functioning in those parts of the body that are supplied by that part of the brain. A stroke can also occur when the blood vessels in the brain burst either due to a bulge in the vessels or due to raised blood pressure etc. I may be able to give a better explanation if I get more information on the medical problems that your grandmother had earlier, the medications and the tests & investigations reports.

I m very confused. I do have high blood pressure buy that is under control.","Doctor":"Hi I did review your concern.Low potassium can be due to multitude of reasons like a problem with medications you are taking like for blood pressure or a problem with your kidneys or adrenal glands.A proper diagnosis is required for accurate management of low potassium as it needs to remain between 3 to 5.5. Low as well as high potassium causes muscle fatigue and weakness, so you do not feel like doing anything.Apart from that low and high potassium affects your heart. First there are ECG changes and later on there can be life threatening arrhythmias.The low potassium you are having can be due to your blood pressure medication or can be associated with your blood pressure. people with high blood pressure and low potassium without use of any medication causing it can have adrenal problems and need to be evaluated accordingly like a CT scan of abdomen.I hope this helpswish you all the best. let me know if you have any more questions or concerns.Thank you for using healthcare magic."},{"Patient":"hi,I have been seeing my doctor for over four months with two hostipal doctors seen has well when i frist went to my gp he gave me movicol to take after about 4 to 5 weeks i had to go to AE has my beely was full of wind and they put 2 tablets into my backside and after about 40 minutes i went to the tolilet which worked and help clear my belly of wind but since then i have charged my diet has told to do and i am going to have a endoscopic examination in two weeks time but also i have put on a stone in 5 weeks and my blood test are ok apart from what they call the platlets are a bit low,Please advise has this is getting me very down Thank You","Doctor":"Hi i did review your concern.

As you have already got your blood tests, ultrasound further investigations as advised would be a better idea for getting a proper diagnosis:CT scan of the abdomen;EnteroclysisDiagnostic Laparoscopy if Endometriosis is suspected.

I have been gluten free 4 months but still have constant nausea, fatigue and am always hungry feeling. The celiac was not clinicall thur blood work or biopsy. I figured it out myself after 2 years of pain and every test coming back neg. Any suggestions? No abd pain since going gluten free","Doctor":"I will start with the problem of celiac disease which as I understand from your description is a self diagnosis. My advice would be to get this diagnosis confirmed with a biopsy  and consulted with a gastroenterologist, because a diagnosis of celiac disease requires a life long nutritional modification which means being completely gluten free. Patients who consume diets that are gluten free require good nutritional advice from a physician/nutritionist in order to prevent nutritional deficiencies. One of the reasons for exhaustion/fatigue etc is a nutritional deficiency which may be subtle to begin with.  Anemia ( low hemoglobin in the blood)may occur due to nutritional causes or it may be associated with the Sjogrens that you have stated . Anemia is one of the causes of feeling fatigued. Therefore I suggest that you should first consult a gastroenterologist regarding your diagnosis of celiac disease .You should also have a complete blood count done which is a blood test . Please check your hemoglobin values first. You may also review your medication and symptoms with your health care provider about the Sjogrens. Nutritional advice from a nutritionist is essential if you are advised to be gluten free."},{"Patient":"hi there i'm ill but to proud to go to the doctors because i'v cause my ill health by injecting myself with vaseline into my forehead cause i didnt like the shape of my forehead i'v been living with this for 6 years now, i'v lost hair so been wearing a hat,lately i'v been bruising very easyly and my bones have started clicking,and think my blood thin too,  please help","Doctor":"Dear friend. Doctors are trained to help you and not judge you so dont worry. The first step of course is to book an appointment with a  doctor whom you trust. It is essential to get a test called COMPLETE BLOOD COUNT done because of your symptoms of bruisability. Complete blood count also called CBC for short is a laboratory test which indicates the quantity of the white and red blood cells , platelets & Hemoglobin in your blood. Your doctor may also order other blood tests for your bone pain such as serum protein electrophoresis, serum calcium etc. Please remember that diseases detected earlier can be managed better . So please book an appointment with your physician and dont worry about the vaseline part . What is more important is that we have to do some tests to find out the cause of your bruisability and bone pain.

Viscerial arteriografia also unchenged, thickening of the iheum and jejunum was only noticed.My friend has a low level of iron and potassium but the intravenous administration minimally raises the hemoglobin level. It was initialy enough to roll blood once every 3-4 weeks, but since 3 months administration of two units of blood rises hemoglobin for only 0,5 while it can decrease during the day even by up to 1.

He was not having trouble breathing and had no chest pains. The pediatrician told us to go the the ER. They did an EKG, his oxygen level was 99, they did a chest xray and a CT. They could find nothing wrong. They said his white blood cell count was slightly elevated. The coloration faded in about an hour. It returned an hour later but not as dark. The next day it happened several times but never as dark as the first time it happened. They are sending us to a cardiologist. I am looking for some answers as to what could be wrong with him.","Doctor":"The bluish coloration as you have described  may occur when there is deoxygenated blood -that is blood with less oxygen in it. This condition in medical terms is called CYANOSIS ( cyan meaning bluish) . Since our heart is the pump that supplies us with oxygenated blood , the first step in a child with cyanosis would be to get the heart checked.Your doctor has correctly referred you to a cardiologist as this is the first step . Certain heart problems require a cardiologists expertise. They would probably do a test called Echocardiogram to get a better view of the detailed working of the chambers , valves etc of the heart.  Not all cardiac diseases present with chest pain or breathing problems. Some have mild symptoms and some do not have any symptoms.The elevation of the white blood cell count since it is marginal may or may not be significant.

Doctor I am a patient of haemolytic anemea now I am suffering from jaundice earlier the billiubrium value raised to 50 but now I am discharged with the billiubrium 10 value .now 5 days are already passed . how much time it will take to recover fully.","Doctor":"There are many causes of hemolytic anemia. Some causes are due to problems in the genes such as THALASSEMIA , G6PD deficiency , sickle cell anemia etc. Other causes are acquired such as due to certain drugs or autoimmune diseases. The term HEMOLYTIC means red cells are being destroyed at an increasing rate. Normally our red cells live for 120 days after that they are destroyed. To put it in a simple way when they are destroyed , their waste products are bilirubin ( yellow in color)which in normal people doesn't accumulate. However in hemolytic anemia the life span of the red cell is reduced and the red cells get destroyed faster so the bilirubin that is produced accumulates causing jaundice. As you have not included your complete blood report I cannot offer you an explanation of the type of hemolytic anemia that you are suffering from. If the hemolytic anemia occurred suddenly after say taking a medicine then one of the possibilities is hemolytic anemia due to G6PD deficiency which is an enzyme within the red cells. There are many causes of hemolytic anemia. Different treatments for different causes so I can give you a detailed explanation only if I have more information on the blood tests that have been done for you.

The blood pressure is high and fluctuant due to multiple factors. His kidney function would be on the decline due to age, diabetes and a neuropathic bladder. This elevates blood pressure.

If the doctor cannot use clinical info to filter the differential diagnosis then the list of potential diagnoses becomes impractical to use, because of its huge size.I understand that tuberculosis is the main problem. Tuberculosis may cause any disorder in the complete blood count. The closet the values return to normal the better for the efficacy of the treatment. There is use in commenting on values like the lymphocytes or the Rdw.  Perhaps if I knew the complete medical history,  there could be a reason for that.The qualitative crp is also useless. A quantitave measurement would be much more useful. The esr is a better alternative for tuberculosis and it seems to get better. His last values are almost normal which is a very encouraging sign about the efficacy of the treatment. The uric acid values are probably related to pyrazinamide use. If he's excretion a lot of it in his urine then he should take drugs to lower uric acid.Regarding treatment efficacy although the tests seem to get better, These tests are not sufficient to judge it. Radiological and microbiological tests are more important, like a chest x-ray and sputum tests.I hope I've helped!

The inside of my body feels like a high fever but my skin feels just warmer than normal. I took my temp and it was 101.9. I have several other symptoms including extreme lethargy ( have trouble stating awake all day), confusion, forgetfulness and the one that bothers me the most is the dizziness. When my eyes move, I feel like there are tails following slowly behind. I had a hysterectomy in 1996. Thought that I was B12 Deficient, but did labs and it came back 904. My RBC Folate Result was elevated to 1022.  Have any ideas?","Doctor":"Hi i did review your condition. High red blood cell folate is seen in few conditions like obesity, vitamin B12 deficiency, blind loop syndrome and some other. I would advice you to consult a doctor and get yourself analyzed for the fever and confusion that you have been having. the best initial tests would be complete blood count, liver function tests, kidney function test, and thyroid function tests as well as serum electrolytes.Then we will probably know the cause of your fever or atleast know in which direction to move forward.I hope this helps Wish you a very healthy life ahead."},{"Patient":"i m 48 years old with MRI finding that says several tiny T2 hyperintense foci noted in the white matter of the frontal lobes bilaterally in keeping with minimal chronic microangiopathic ischemic white matter changes.

Anemia is a common cause of tiredness. Blood tests may reveal a low hematocrit,  electrolyte disorders etc.Regarding the blood clot, it needs time. After some time the vessel may become patent again and the clot ultrasonographic appearance will change. A repeat scan after 1-2 months may be different from the first one.I hope I've helped.

Does the H.Pylori infection or the Labyrinthytis has any role in low count of platelets?Thank you.","Doctor":"I have reviewed your concern my friend. you are doing right thing by going to hematologist. however, decreasing platelet count can be due to different causes. H pylori and labyrinthitis should not ideally cause this problem, but it can be more due to a condition known as idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP). However for this the hematologist needs to review your condition and probably do a bone marrow examination if required and rule out other cause. treatment is steroids which is generally good enough.

Your father seems to have none of them although at his age CKD is possible. Aranesp increases the bone marrow production and may indeed help in increasing the hemoglobin and hematocrit if sufficient iron stores are present.

G6PD deficiency has nothing to do with allergic reactions.

Since she's had increased values in the past, it's probably chronic renal failure (CRF). CRF may cause increased potassium levels. The severity depends on how high they are. If her potassium is higher than 6mEq/L then you should immediately contact your doctor for investigation.If the ratio of bun to creatinine is high (>20) then she can try drinking some water (if she hasn't done so already) because a high ratio indicates dehydration which is a reversible cause of renal failure.I hope I've helped!Contact me again, if you'd like more information.

Faintness may occur as a result of various conditions. The low-normal blood pressure makes him more prone to it but an inciting factor is still needed. Since many different conditions may lead to faintness I cannot guess what was the cause in his case but the removed tumor does not seem relevant. An electrocardiogram and blood tests may exclude most of the serious causes.

About the tingling and numbness you have been experiencing and if its very severe as you may feel, i would advice you to show a neurologist. tingling and numbness can be an early sign of peripheral nerve problems and they need specialized attention. many of them can be cured. one reason might be due to B12 deficiency and after some time when your B12 levels become normal you might be able to recover,however this complaint requires a full diagnostic workup.be rest assured eventually you will be happy hale and heartydo let me know if you have any more questions for me"},{"Patient":"Good afternoon,My iron saturate level is at 17.

The chelating therapy surely helps but not always (and not completely).If this is your case, then Voligbose might help with postprandial blood glucose but it won't target the source of your problems which is (presumably) insulin deficiency due to pancreatic destruction. If insulin is really missing you should take it regardless of the blood glucose levels to prevent serious complications like ketoacidosis. Voligbose is usually given to type 2 patients who have an almost adequate insulin production.Your doctor is the right person to investigate (by evaluating your history and laboratory tests) whether your diabetes is type 1 or type 2 and modify your treatment accordingly.I hope I've helped!I'll be glad to ask any further questions you may have.

What kind of bee I do not know. That afternoon I was taken to hospital with a temp of 106 and subsequently diagnosed after some time with osteomyleitis. They were stumped for awhile. This was in the mid 1950 s. They always said the bee sting had nothing to do with the osteomyleitis. I almost died several times and was in hostilal for over a month and a half,developing pneumonia after I had been stable. Since,I have had terrible trouble with the leg the sting occurred,we think from damage to the illiac vein when dealing with the bone. I had developed vercosities,had a vein stripping at 19years old,a clot in the illiac in 1984 and again in 1996 that caused the vein to collapse. Since,I have become seriously disabled from the neuropathy,poor circulation and many other domino effects of the illiac vein having collapsed and no longer doing its job in my circulatory system. I am now 60 years old. I guess it s moot at this point,but I avoid bees and have never been stung since! I can t imagine that the two are not connected. I don t blame the problems with the vein,since the doctors saved my life. It was possibly nicked at some point,causing scare tissue and resulting clots. Problems with continuity because of insurance changes,even though I was employed consistently as a social worker full time and always had insurance,contributed to having several differant doctors during the time between clots etc... Since,nobody wants to deal with why,or says we don t know??? I have always been curious if anyone has seen osteomyleitis after a sting,since I ve been told it wasn t the cause. Never had a break etc... The resulting lose of the illiac is the current concern,but I m told nothing can be done about it. I have trouble walking, sitting,standing,lying, and am in terrible pain and discomfort ,but I have gotten use to it,as much a s one can,since the initial diagnosis in 1996,when a cat scan found the collapsed iliac vein. It took awhile for the debilitation to show up. But any ideas for that problem will be met with open ears...lol. But seriously it has ruined any chance for a normal life since I was in my early 40 s. I wrote about the curious origin of the osteomyleitis since it was never discovered and I m told it doesn t appear for no reason.","Doctor":"Hi welcome to HCm  I have gone thru your query  and can understand your concern .Dear , Your case seems to be spoilt due to extremly  mishandling .

My hemoglobin went down from a steady 6.0 to 4.0 and that was due to Revlimid. Azacytidine temporarily boosted my Hg to 11.5 in 2004, but after that, it too failed. My first doc put me on Thyroid tablets (100mcg/day) to improve my hypothyroidism. As a result of RARS, I developed secondary hemachromatosis. Mainstream medicine gave up on me.But I did NOT! I have been keeping myself updated with research on this condition and a few weeks ago stumbled upon the Fungii aspect of cancers and how Iodine is efficient in killing all pathogens including Bacteria, Virus and Fungus. I delved further into that angle and started supplementing myself with Kelp tablets, providing my body 1mg to 1.5mg of Iodine. In that past 2-3 weeks, my energy levels have improved considerably and I feel energetic throughout the day. My feet skin which was very dark now has become at least 50% lighter and I feel very lively. Interestingly, I did not have even a quarter of this energy while on Thyroid tablets all these years. I am now able to run up and down the stairs and lift heavy items like suitcases and grocery over longer distances without exhaustion.I strongly feel that this has got to do with increased Iodine intake because I am seeing this radical improvement only within the past 10-15 days. I'd like to know your expert thoughts the role of Iodine in curing RARS.","Doctor":"Hi!

I thought my body would reabsorb it but after reading Dr. Google (I  know…bad nurse), it seems that it can calcify and leave a permanent bump. It is painful and wakes me up at night.

New bruising to inner R foot this morning. Now about 8cm area of numbness to skin above clot. I think there must still be active bleeding to develop new bruising. It feels like a scab is being ripped from my shin internally every time I point my toes which stretches the skin or underlying tissues. This same pain has been consistent for 11 days. I think the clot tries to adhere to the underlying tissues and when I stretch, it pulls away causing that pain and new bleeding. Thoughts? There was numbness immediately after the accident too.

I was sent for an MRI and everything appeared normal. A couple of months later I started to suffer from recurrent infections and illnesses. In the last 2 years I have had many infections including: Recurrent UTI's, kidney infection, recurrent uvulitis, ear infections, recurrent thrush, lymphadenitis and cellulitis (the last 2 requiring hospitalisation). I have also had lots of viruses, colds and flu symptoms. I also suffer from a lot of sores, on my mouth and in my nose, and get lots of mouth ulcers. On a regular basis I suffer from migraines/headaches, aching limbs, neck, shoulders and backache, numbness in arms and hands, with loss of dexterity in the fingers, fatigue, skipped heart-beats and chest pain, 'brain fog' (confusion and memory problems, sometimes slurred speech) and occasional blurred vision, occasional low grade fever, and more recently muscle twitching, spasms and cramps. I eat a healthy diet although I am unable to exercise due to chronic pain. I have put on 2 stone in 2 years but this may be due to lack of exercise and my age - 40 years. ( I am now about a stone overweight) I have also had bouts of depression, usually as a result of being so fed up of it all. I was referred to an Infectious Diseases Specialist about 18 months ago, and initially it was suggested possible CFS. She has run many blood tests to rule out things like thyroid, diabetes and HIV, and I have also had an ECG and cardiac scan. Although my blood tests are usually relatively normal (apart from when I am really ill), the one thing that does crop up almost every time is a low white blood cell count. Neutropenia and leukopenia have been noted on several occasions. I recently had another test and all was normal apart from a low absolute leukocyte count (normal range 1.5 - 4.......mine was 1.1). As yet I still don't have a diagnosis. Am I right in assuming that the reason I am always getting ill is because of the leukopenia? Or is the leukopenia a result of always being ill? Do you have any ideas of what could be the cause? Or any suggestions of a diagnosis? Or can you suggest or recommend any more tests? I would be very grateful for any assistance, thanks.","Doctor":"Hi! you are absolutely correct!You often get infections and you say, 'On a regular basis I suffer from migraines/headaches, aching limbs, neck, shoulders and backache, numbness in arms and hands, with loss of dexterity in the fingers, fatigue, skipped heart-beats and chest pain, 'brain fog' (confusion and memory problems, sometimes slurred speech) and occasional blurred vision, occasional low grade fever, and more recently muscle twitching, spasms and cramps...'WHAT IS YOUR DIFFERENTIAL COUNT OF WBC?WHAT IS THE STATUS OF IMMUNOGLOBULINS?PLATELET COUNT NORMAL?

You have not given full details regarding the disease you were diagnosed as a child.2. Based on the details of back ache and diagnosis of reticulocyte endotheliosis it appears you would have had a solitary manifestation of Langerhans cell disease.3.

After I go to the bathroom it is better. Sometimes I feel like I can't breath. It gets so bad sometimes I feel like I should go to the hospial but just as fast as it comes on it goes away. Do you know what this could be?","Doctor":"Hi.This occurs due to excessive parasympathetic reaction so that you get this pain and sweating. The the bowel or bladder is evacuated the pressure and hence the reaction is reduced.  So you get better. I would advise in such a patient to get a clinical examination done and few investigations as may be advised by your Specialist Doctor.Never to hold the bladder or bowel movement at any cost.

Oh and I am only 32 years old, I shouldn't be feeling this bad.","Doctor":"Hello and welcome to HCM,The symptoms of chronic fatigue, joint pain, water retention and weight gain are not associated with high prolactin levels.High prolactin level is caused by increased secretion of prolactin by pituitary gland.Increased secretion of prolactin can be due to prolactin secreting tumor.The symptoms of fatigue, water retention, depression and weight gain are suggestive of disorders of thyroid gland.Hypothyroidism can lead to similar symptoms.Thus, thyroid function tests are required to assess the thyroid functions.Pituitary gland also needs to be examined by imaging study to look for any tumor of pituitary gland.Thanks and take careDr Shailja Puri"},{"Patient":"I think I have really bad blood circulation because of many reasons.

THANK YOU - I REALLY NEED AN ANSWER----IN PAIN / CAN t sleep THANK YOU FOR AT LEAST LISTENING ; karen","Doctor":"Hello,I've never read anywhere about acute renal failure caused by topamax! It can cause oliguria sometimes which means a lower urine volume, which under certain circumstances may aggravate renal function and lead to acute renal failure (for example: in dehydrated patients). Topamax increased the rate of renal stone formation, which may lead to obstruction of the urinary tract and cause renal failure. Obstruction causes severe pain, so you should know it if something like that happened in your case.Topamax may - rarely - cause hypokalemia. Hypokalemia can also be caused by polyuric renal failure. Renal failure may present with either oliguria (less urine) or polyuria (excessive urine) and sometimes oliguria is followed by polyuria. When too much water is excreted, potassium is lost as well. So if you're passing liters of urine every day then a low potassium level can be attributed to polyuria.So in conclusion, I don't believe Topamax caused renal failure to you because there are not any reports that I know about such a side-effect of this drug. Topamax may indeed cause hypokalemia, although this is a rare event.Taking topamax requires intact kidney function. Otherwise dose reductions are required. You should consult your doctor for alternatives or for dose adjustment depending on your GFR (Glomerular Filtration Rate).I hope I've helped!If you'd like further information, please contact me again and I'll be glad to help.Kind Regards!"},{"Patient":"my sister has got an almost scale like pattern on her arm. its not a rash and we think its something to do with the blood because its underneath the skin.

I am a 25 year old woman with asthma and a few allergies (house dust and some types of pollen), but otherwise in good order.

It happens under no other circumstances, but it doesn't happen every time I have a drink. The temperature or type of drink seems to have no effect. I thought it might have something to do with my liver, but I recently had my liver tested during a general check-up, and it was fine. I don't binge drink, nor do I get drunk.

Its not very significant as it might come to normal after the infection settles.4. However if counts do not get back to normal, then she needs to be evaluated for causes of leucopenia. She might need a bone marrow examination too. Hope this helpsRegards"},{"Patient":"I have been feeling quite dizzy for the past three days, even when I'm lying down at times.

I am female and 66 years old.","Doctor":"HiThanks for your queryBased on your query, my opinion is1. Dizziness could be due to hypotension, as you have increased the dose of antihypertensives.2. It could be due to hypoglycemia. skipping meals/ eating less/ loss of appetite may be some of the reasons.3. Ear problems can also cause dizziness. If you have ringing sensation in ears/ hearing loss consult your doctor for further measures.4. Besides taking the prescribed medications, be regular with your diet.Hope this helpsRegards"},{"Patient":"How low does your hemoglobin have to be to cause anemia itching? I have recently had a cbc and my hemoglobin was low. And for the last 5 days I have had itching of my scalp, arms, back and shoulders. It feels like itching prickling. No rash, no redness just itching.","Doctor":"HiThanks for your queryBased on your query1. Anemia as such does not cause itching.2. Itching commonly occurs due to allergies, if it is generalized like in your case, may be food allergy or external irritants. 3. You need to rule out jaundice too as it is also one of the causes of itching. Hemolytic anemia will have jaundice as one of the prime presentation.4. You can get relief from itching by taking oral/ parenteral antihistamines. You can use some soothing agents like calamine lotion.Hope this helpsRegards"},{"Patient":"Been donating plasma for 4 times now. I donated plasma almost a week ago, I blacked out at the end of it, and had a seizure for about 2 seconds they told me. I weigh 246, male, 22 years old, 5 11 . I knew it was because I didn t eat enough that day, only a Greek Yogurt. I have now eaten a lot more for my next donation, does it sound like I am ready?","Doctor":"HiThanks for your queryBased on your query my opinion is1. Frequent blood/ plasma donation is advisable but at an interval of three months.2. Though physical fitness is one of the criterias for blood donation, other things like frequency of donation/ coexisting illness, is important on deciding on donation besides willingness to donate.3. Since you have a history of seizures, its not advisable to donate for now as you will have to get evaluated for the cause of seizures first and take necessary measures.Hope this helps"},{"Patient":"Last year I had a blood test done which came back positive for the sickle cell trait.

I was in the ER twice. I was told I did not need a D & C and the first ER visit no retained tissue.

Could there be a link?","Doctor":"HiThanks for your queryBased on your query, my opinion is1. Menstrual cycle is not related to low white cell count.2. Irregular cycles are usually suggestive of hormonal imbalance. Causes being perimenopausal age group/ hormonal therapy.3. If there is amenorrhea for a long time for example in your case 6 months, then menstrual bleed will be quite heavy as it is a withdrawal bleed. If you are in the perimenopausal age group, then not to bother much. 4. However if bleeding persists or is bothering you, then causes of menorrhagia need to be ruled out, like endometrial hyperplasia/malignancy.5. Low white count can predispose you to infection as these cells are the first line of defence mechanism in the body. So if you are having recurrent infections then you need to get evaluated and take treatment depending upon on causeHope this helpsRegards"},{"Patient":"Developed pulmonary embolism following shoulder surgery.

Low platelet count is not linked to lichen planus.2. Presence of lichen planus does not indicate HIV.3. If you have got a blood test done and that is seropositve, then it indicates HIV.4. Your platelet counts are below the lower limit of normal range, so it can cause skin or mucosal bleeds with trivial injury.5. If you have bleeding symptoms seek immediate medical attention.6. Lichen planus is a sclerotic condition of the skin, not an infection, so not of much concern.Hope this helps.Regards"},{"Patient":"Hi, I am Pratik 31yr old male from India. I have Acute ITP. The first time occured in 2007 and I took Prednisone for 6 months. The counts remained normal for 3 years and recently I had a re-episode of ITP. Within 3 days of hospitalisation and Prednisone (Methyl) given thru glucose transfusion the count came to Normal. Now I am again on Prednisone for the last 3 months and count is beyond 300000....what are the chances of re occurence or how can I avoid this condition. I am a little worried. Please advice","Doctor":"Hi Pratik,ITP, especially in adults can have a chronic course ,sometimes persistent, and a recurring course with varying frequencies in others. The steroids have to slowly tapered and stopped and  later you have regularly monitor your platelet count to watch for recurrence. However don't get paranoid and a platelet count more than 30,000 is compatible with a normal,albeit disciplined lifestyle as long as your bleeding symptoms are in control."},{"Patient":"I have what i thought was a broken blood vessel on my stomach and turned out to be like a red blood mole and i scratched it and it was bleeding for like 2 hours last night and it stops when i tape gauze to it.  I was just wondering if i should just keep doing that tell it heals or go see a Dr","Doctor":"HiThanks for your queryBased on your query, my opinion is1. Bleeding on skin should normally stop within three minutes. If it persists it indicates some bleeding problems maybe decreased platelet counts/ defective platelets/ vascular disorders.2. In your case it persisted for two hours which is abnormal. So you need to consult a doctor to evaluate the cause of bleed and appropriate course of action.3. You are not sure if its a mole or just a tear. So its important to know the type of lesion. That will help the lesion to heal faster as a mole can be excised so that you would not have this problem again.4. If its any other lesion, this would be confirmed with biopsy.Hope this helps.Regards"},{"Patient":"doctor i am taking Prednisolone tablet for platelete count for one month and still continuing. rite now count is 60,000 so continuing. now fine. i am working at pune office. but two to three days feeling shivering in hands and legs.so what to do? should i take any medicine and what food to eat?","Doctor":"Hi,Prednisolone has to tapered after one month slowly irrespective of the platelet count under the guidance of a hematologist, who may however keep you on a low maintainance dose if you turn out to steroid dependent.  Regarding the shivers, please see a doctor and  check your BP, rule out infection before attributing it to steroid side effects."},{"Patient":"Hi, may I answer your health queries right now ?  Please type your query here...The bottoms of my feet swell.  I have high arches and wear dr. Office issued arch inserts. I have high bp and take tekturna.

I don't have visible vericose veins. I am42 and work part time. I want to work full time but my feet aren't cooperating. Any suggestions!","Doctor":"HiThanks for your query.Based on your query, my opinion is1. Swelling of feet or lower limbs can be due to subtle causes like postural/ dependent that is sitting for long hours.2. Other conditions like cardiac diseases/ varicose veins/ renal disorders are more serious problems which needs to be evaluated for.3. Since you have hypertension and an uncontrolled diabetes, both can cause renal impairment over a long term. So get a renal function test done.4. Since you are on overweight side, there is exertion on lower limbs, so venous drainage will be impaired to cause pedal edema.5. You need to reduce weight, be regular with your medications and make lifestyle changes( diet/ nutrition/ routine).6. You can try keeping your feet raised while seated/ lying down so that swelling would reduce.Hope this helps.Regards"},{"Patient":"I am 19 years old, 5ft 1, and around 7.5 stone. 2 years ago i was diagnosed with pernicious anaemia and now receive a b12 injection every 3months.

Your complaints may be genuinely related to pernicious anemia as vitamin b 12 deficiency is known to cause neurological symptoms.2. However if you are regular on your medications, then chances of pernicious anemia causing you problems is quite less. 3. You can get vitamin b 12 stores evaluated along with red cell folate levels. 4. You are also having some problems with your routine life and concerned about education.So depression is most probably related to these.5.

Good morning. I am Dr Shareef answering your query.If I were your doctor, I would advise you for a routine/microscopic/culture and sensitivity test of your urine, an unsuspected UTI being one of the common causes of such chronic and recurrent pain in the lower abdomen. Once this is excluded, then we could go for other investigations like a complete blood count, and an ultrasound/CT scan of the abdomen during the period when you get pain. Till that you could go for an anti spasmodic drug for a symptomatic relief.

Since you have been a heavy drinker for the last 5 years or so this is reflected in the form of suspected liver injury giving rise of elevated levels of GGT.Over time, your GGT level will fall from whatever level it was at when you stopped drinking alcohol to within the normal range. This can take several weeks to more than a month. Abstaining from alcohol will decrease your chances of further damaging your liver and should allow your liver function to improve.My dear take care of your precious health, avoid drinking alcohol as time again and again the scientists across the globe have proved that it virtually damages almost all the organs of the body in short period of time.Take care of your health.Best regards!"},{"Patient":"im a 33 y/o edimetrial cancer survivoir, total hyst 2 years ago,ca present in uterus, ovary, abdomen, and i had cancer in my bladder.

I am Dr Shareef answering your query.Discomfort in the testis could be due to ignored repeated trivial trauma (specially in your case due to your job profile), which causes inflammation causing pain/discomfort in the same. Testis being an intra-abdominal organ embryo-logically, brings the nerve supply to it from above, and so the pain in the testis is frequently radiated/felt as a discomfort in the abdomen/pelvis area. If I were your doctor, after a thorough physical examination I would advise you for the following:1) Support your testes with properly fitting under garments.2) Avoid standing for prolonged period, and avoid lifting heavy weight if you do.3) Advise you for a routine blood tests like a CBC, AEC, HbsAG, HIV test and a urine routine/microscopic examination followed by a culture and sensitivity report if need be.4) Avoid indulgence in any sexual activity if you are active sexually which would prevent further trivial trauma if any to the testes, apart from precipitating any kind of infection if present.5) Prescribe a broad spectrum antibiotic along with an anti inflammatory drug, and a proton pump inhibitor. The antibiotic could change after the report of the culture sensitivity test of urine.Hernia is a separate entity and has to be dealt with separately by your surgeon. However, a ureteric stone has to be ruled out with the help of an abdominal scan which also gives rise to abdominal pain radiating to the penis and testis on that particular side.I hope this information would help you in discussing with your family physician/treating doctor in further management of your problem. Please do not hesitate to ask in case of any further doubts.Thanks for choosing health care magic to clear doubts on your health problems. I wish you an early recovery.

I tried running them under hot water, not wearing bracelets, and nonstop movement and yet it continues. It's been like this for the pass four days and tomorrow will be the fifth; what's wrong with my hands?","Doctor":"Hi,Thanks for asking.Based on your query, my opinion is as follows.1. Appears to be Raynaud's phenomenon.2. It can also occur due to stress, and that would be the reason for it turning blue at other times.3. Also need to get hemoglobin level checked. Doppler blood flow and antibodies screen maybe necessary.4. Vasodilators will be helpful. Meet your doctor for diagnosis and prescription.Hope it helps.Any further queries, happy to help again."},{"Patient":"I recently saw an article about a young, athletic boy who has ITP and is living with the ups and downs of a low platelet count. I am female, 51 yrs. old, and was diagnosed with ITP at 18 yrs. old. I did a 3 month diminishing steroid treatment, and then still had a lower than expected platelet count. I was told I had to have a splenectomy, which I did. My platelet count has been fine ever since, including thru 2 pregnancies. I have had timed bleeding tests to be certain that it would be safe for my children to be born naturally as well as while in labor, scalp samles from the child to make sure that the child's blood count was okay to continue with natural child birth. It was. My question is this: Is there a reason why a doctor would not prescribe a splenectomy now for a male teenager with ITP? If so, are there health concerns that I need to know about being a person without a spleen for so many years?","Doctor":"Hi,Thanks for asking.Based on your query, my opinion is as follows.1. Spleen is an important organ in immune system, specifically against capsulated organisms.2. In ITP, spleen is the site of destruction and hence its removal will improve platelets count.3. Splenectomy increases risk of severe infection by capsulated organisms and usually is last resort treatment. Vaccination is available against these common capsulated organisms.4. As the age is younger for the boy, the risk of infection is present for longer time, hence they are waiting and watching to check for progression. In the young, chronic ITP risk is low and acute ITP usually comes under control.Hope it helps.Any further queries, happy to help again."},{"Patient":"Visibly swollen lymph nodes all over. CBC count shows high wbc, mono absolute, Neo absolute, Eos absolute, MPV. Some have have tripled since last CBC. Was told it was a kidney infection and given Cipro, this helped the lymphs that were painful, the others remained. For instance the lymphs in  my arm by my elbow you can visually see them and they are about 1 inch long (2 of them) this is on both sides, the left is worst. I have strange pains in my left side of abdomnen, in the crease in my thigh, shoulders, legs and back. When I sit back in a chair it feels as if I am leaining on a ball and it is pusing into my lower back. I have tingly sensations where I think the lymphs are at. My joints are starting to hurt (think from the Cipro). Vision is getting worse, mild temp, occasional hot flashes. I also have had shortness of breath since this has started. My CBC count was abnormal from a stomach pain that woke me from my sleep months ago, since then most of the levels have tripled that were high before. I also get these weird hot tingle sensations on my breast. I can't keep being told it is nothing. I can't afford to go to the doctor's over and over and not get anything healed. Any suggestions or thought of what this may be? I feel like my doctor and ER are blowing it off.","Doctor":"Hi,Thanks for asking.Based on your query, my opinion is as follows.1. Infection can cause lymph nodes enlargement.2. Depending on type of infection, neutrophil or lymphocytes will increase, which will cause overall increased WBC count.3.

Her pediatrician told me not to worry because her levels have been around the same range since she was a baby. - WBC Standard Range: 5.0 - 17.0 THOU/uL -- Her Value: 5.9 - RBC Standard Range: 3.9 - 5.3 MIL/uL -- Her Value: 4.7 - Hemoglobin Standard Range: 11.5 - 14.0 g/dL -- Her Value: 11.7 - Hematocrit Standard Range: 34 - 40 % -- Her Value: 35 - MCV Standard Range: 76 - 87 fL -- Her Value: 75 - RDW Standard Range: 11.7 - 14.4 % -- Her Value: 13.5 - Platelets Standard Range: 160 - 370 THOU/uL -- Her Value: 295 - Iron Standard Range: 34 - 165 ug/dL -- Her Value: 98 - TIBC Standard Range: 250 - 450 ug/dL -- Her Value: 338 - Transferrin Saturation Standard Range: 15 - 50 % -- Her Value: 29 - Ferritin Standard Range: 10 - 120 ng/mL -- Her Value: 16 No one on my side of the family has (had) anemia & I m not sure about her father s side. My daughter is an energetic, happy girl, who has a healthy diet. She rarely eats processed foods & we have her stay away from sweets as much as possible. Her diet consist of: - red meat once a week - chicken once a week - fish and/or seafood twice a week - dairy: cheese, yogurt & milk everyday - brown rice, pasta, eggs, vegetables, fruit, grains, beans, etc. - Cheerios, granola oatmeal for breakfast cereals I know that fruits & vegetables high in vitamin C help your blood absorb iron & my daughter eats those every day. So, when I got her test results back I was very confused ... and scared. I know she doesn t have lead poisoning, but will rule that one out with further blood work. Can you please shed some light on what could be/is happening? Thank you for your time & consideration. ~ Kathy","Doctor":"all values of blood are within normal range except three which are also at lower point(within -2 SD of 3 year age child blood value) of normal range. here seems nothing any pathological issues. aggression and sleeping problems can be changed by  psychological treatment."},{"Patient":"Hello Doctor, I am a 48 year old male with Eosinophilia Myalgia Syndrome, from taking L-Tryptophan capsules.

Lot of stress and sensitivity to sounds also.","Doctor":"hi.Stopping ingestion of L-tryptophan or any other agent that may be the offending factor is key in the treatment of eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome (EMS).Because of the protean manifestations of EMS, patients are treated based on their symptoms. Chronic symptoms, such as muscle pain, spasm, weakness, neuropathy, and skin thickening, are noninflammatory and are treated symptomatically. Intermittent use of muscle relaxants and analgesics. In addition, prednisone is commonly prescribed because inflammation plays a role. However, treatment with corticosteroids is not beneficial in reducing the severity or duration of symptoms. Long-term steroid therapy has no role.Assistance with activities of daily living can be taken.you can consult neurologist for your multiple problems.hope this is helpful.take care."},{"Patient":"Hi I have had menstrual cycle problems in the past however with diet and exercise advised by a gynacologist my periods became normal with a 24-25 day cycle..

The same applies for hypertension. Hypertension and elevated uric acid levels are sometimes interconnected but not causally. That is hypertension is not caused by uric acid and uric acid elevation is not caused by hypertension. They just happen to exist in combination particularly in overweight or obese individuals along with increased triglycerides, blood glucose, waist perimeter, low HDL (high density cholesterol) levels etcAn isolated uric acid elevation (that is without the other findings that I  mentioned, particularly when lower than 9-10mg/dL) is nothing to worry about unless you've suffered gout attacks, have had uric acid renal stones or have had uric acid skin nodules.If you're overweight, keep in mind that weight loss will make uric acid levels decline.

However if fever persists, you will need another course of antibiotics.Hope this helpsWish you good health"},{"Patient":"my 90 year old mother has a very large bruise on her arm above the wrist area which she is calling a blood tumor or cyst. it has not been diagnosed by a doctor so this is her name for it. she said it is blue in color. if this is just a large bruise with blood under the skin, what would be the correct method of treatment.

I would advise :CT scan of the chest and the abdomen.Upper GI endoscopy. IT is possible that there may be a rare tumour of the supra-renal glands or so which can cause similar problems.

A though history taking and physical examination can give your Physician an idea about probable diagnosis and further investigations of blood , urine and stool. This will lead to a proper diagnosis and treatment ."},{"Patient":"hi i got itp and i was wanting to get my nose pierced for awhile(my chemo dr said just get my blod work done befor i do it)and i just got over shingles in my eye but the eye dr says its in the eye lid n come back in 2 month.is it safe to get my nose periced now or wait .what kind of infections risk do i have compared to a normal person.ty","Doctor":"Hello and welcome to HCM,Low platelet counts associated with ITP can lead to excessive bleeding during nose piersing.If the ITP is under control and platelet count has improved, you can get the piercing done.However, the piercing should be safe and carried out clean needle to avoid transmission of blood borne infections.Shingles is not a contraindication because it has not involved the deratome which supplies the nose.Thanks and take careDr Shailja Puri"},{"Patient":"I am 48 years old man.

The ciprofloxacin is making me feel nausea and the headache is constant. I was prescribed 500mg 2 pills a day.

My blood counts were low (red, platelets, neutrophils, white) and was advised to stop drinking alcohol.  I consistently had 2 drinks per night, every night for about 6 years.  Six months later, my blood counts all increased after quitting alcohol (red form 4.01 to 5.22, platelets from 110 to 242, hemoglobin, hematocrit, neutrophils from 1.5 to 2.0), but my overall white cells went from 3.1 to only 3.9.  Many things I read online associate low blood counts potentially to hiv.  I have not been involved in risky behavior for many years.  Should I be concerned?  Thank you.","Doctor":"HiThanks for your queryBased on your query, my opinion is1. RBCs and platelet count is within normal limits, WBC count is on the lower side of normal.2. You should not be concerned about these values as long as you are asymptomatic.3. Low counts need not necessarily mean HIV associated. There are many more causes for low counts, commonly when the marrow is suppressed by infectious or hereditary cause.4. Since your counts are back to normal, di not both much.Hope this helpsRegards"},{"Patient":"Hi over the past year i have had raised esr on and off.

Raised ESR indicates an underlying inflammation. You have a history of ligament tear, arthritis, anemia and now crohn's disease. All of these cause a raise in ESR. 2. At times of disease remission you might have found that to have decreased. 3. Increase in ESR can't be corrected with treatment. The underlying cause needs to be treated. 4. Stick to the treatment regime you are on for Crohn's and arthritis and follow up closely with the  lab investigation for treatment response.

Now that he is on treatment, the enzyme levels should have settled to normal. 3.

Iron deficiency anemia needs to be treated with iron supplements, oral or parenteral depending on your Hemoglobin levels. You can get a reticulocyte count done two weeks after starting iron therapy to check for response.2. Also improve on your diet by taking iron rich food.3. Joint pains is probably related to lupus as lupus affects multiple organ systems. You need to take analgesics and antiinflammatory agents till the symptoms subside.4. Platelets are on the lower side of normal range, not to bother if there is no frank skin or mucosal bleeds.5. All the parameters related to RBC will come to normal once Hemoglobin improves and iron deficiency is correctedHope this helpsWish you good health"},{"Patient":"Hi...I have an 8 month old and during my pregnancy my blood platelet count dropped into the 50s.

The platelet count in malaria is reduced mainly due to reduced production. Its one of the common finding in malarial infection.2. Even though platelet count is low, bleeding is rarely seen and not to be worried about.3. Now that its improving, not to worry. If the count were to fall less than 10,000, then internal bleeding possibility is present and needs to be looked into.4. Complete the course of antimalarials.

If the TSH level is normal, all your symptoms will disappear. There is nothing wrong with increasing thyroxine levels, as it supports your overall body function.4.

When I first learned this I started taking normal daily vitamins that had some iron in them, but over the last couple months they don't seem to be helping at all. I was wondering what the recommended amount, in terms of milligrams, would be for iron supplements for mild anemia?","Doctor":"Hi,Thanks for asking.Based on your query, my opinion is as follows.1. During periods of iron deficiency, dietary intake of iron through food alone would not be sufficient.2. Recommended daily allowance normally is 8-11 mg. Due to deficiency, atleast if 20 mg/day gets absorbed, then the stores can be replenished. Iron tablets need to be taken. Along with it Vit C also needs to be taken, which will help in iron absorption. Empty stomach or acid environment, will be helpful in furthering iron absorption. 3. Additionally diet rich in spinach, beef, chicken, ham, mussels, salmon, beans, tuna, ragi etc could be helpful in improving iron storage. For Vit C rich foods, you can take grape juice, broccoli, guava, kiwi fruit, raw papaya, sweet potato tomato juice, etc.4. Check reticulocyte count after 2 weeks, to see for improvement.

In your case iron levels are normal but still on the lower limit of normal, so get iron stores, iron saturation and TIBC done to rule out or confirm iron deficiency as cause of anemia.5.

Fourthly, I can think about nerve entrapment into the scar tissues. The treatment will necessarily be dependent upon all the findings."},{"Patient":"I am 29 Male.

He had prostate cancer two years ago followed by 39 treatments of radiation and about 8 treatments of hormone therapy. Could this have contributed to the low hemoglobin?

Low potassium is known to myalgia, muscle cramps, abnormal heart rhythms, flaccid paralysis, constipation, etc. It needs to be corrected slowly, as increased potassium is much more dangerous.3. Potassium blood check up and results should be complete within an hour of you giving your sample to the lab.4. Take potassium rich food in diet like potato, banana, apricots, fish etc to improve potassium. Diuretics commonly cause hypokalemia. Look into your medications.Hope it helps.Any further queries, happy to help again."},{"Patient":"Hello and thanks for your help in advance. I am becoming very worried about my health. First off, I'm diabetic (type 2) and over the past year i've been getting BS readings in the high 200's and A1C readings around 10 & 11. I'm currently taking Metformin(1000 mg/twice a day) and an insulin called Levemir(17 units in the morning), yet i'm still reading high. Is there anything I can do to bring it down? Second, I was sexually active on February 27 and I haven't gotten my cycle since Jan 26. They have always been irregular, but not to this extent. I've taken about 10 at home pregnancy test that all read negative as well as a recent blood test that read the same. I've been having pregnancy symptoms and still no cycle. Could this be related in any way to diabetes or am i missing my cycle because it was my first sexual activity in over 11 years?","Doctor":"Hi,Thanks for asking.Based on your query, my opinion is as follows.1. Diabetes is a metabolic disorder affecting multiple systems. Obesity is one of the commonest cause of type II diabetes mellitus. Obesity can affect the endocrine system and hormones, which has at present resulted in loss of menstrual cycles. It is not related to sexual activity.2. Control of blood sugar and HbA1C reading requiresa. Weight control within normal rangeb. Controlled diet of carbohydrates, proteins and low fat with high fiber. Additional insulin needs to be added to control blood sugar. The medication at present is not titrated adequately to diet and insulin resistance.c. Moderate exercises. d. Metformin is already high. Other oral hypoglycemics to improve sensitivity and insulin production needs to be added.3. Once diabetes is under control and weight reduction is initiated, the menstrual cycles will start. The poor control values at present are serious and can cause both acute and chronic complications, particularly neuropathies, nephropathy and retinopathy. Its serious issue. Meet your diabetician and dietitian to control blood sugar. Follow the medications and diet religiously.Hope it helps.Any further queries, happy to help again."},{"Patient":"Hello..I am a 57 year female and Friday night I went to the er and they took blood found out my potassium was very low, was admitted, and got out the next night. Now I feel like my potassium level is trying to get low again. I am on lots of potassium pills morning and night. I am taking a water pill prescribed by my dr. I want to know besides bananas, what can I take to get the potassium level to come up pretty quick? Thanks and God Bless You","Doctor":"Hi,Thanks for asking.Based on your query, my opinion is as follows.1. Low potassium levels are serious.  Low potassium is known to myalgia, muscle cramps, abnormal heart rhythms, flaccid paralysis, constipation, etc. It needs to be corrected slowly, as increased potassium is much more dangerous.2. If you are getting any muscle cramps or pain, then you could be having low potassium. Diuretics or water pill are one of the commonest causes of low potassium. You need to discuss with your doctor regarding this. Other medication maybe added for blood pressure replacing the diuretics.3. Diet rich in bananas, dark leafy greens, potatoes, yoghurt, fish, avocadas etc could help in improving it. Slow increase in potassium is necessary as hyperkalemia can cause instant death. If potassium is too slow, slow infusion will be given.

She has a WBC count of 15400 which is not in the normal range. She does not have any infection, cold, caugh or fever. I am little worried about the count. Please help","Doctor":"Hi,Thanks for asking.Based on your query, my opinion is as follows.1. Pregnancy is a stressful period. 2. During periods of stress, WBC count will be increased. Check for the differential counts of various cells. If any particular cells like lymphocytes or neutrophils are increased, then it needs to be looked into. Mild neutrophil count elevation can be seen.3. Also check for any immature cells in the differential counts. If its not there, then well and good, it is possibly related to stress.4. In pregnancy, anemia and thrombocytopenia are more important markers. WBC count, if its reducing below normal, then worrisome. At present, its only mildly increased, not to worry.

Poor appetite leading onto reduced food intake is the cause here.2. The nutrition, particularly iron, vit B12 and folic acid levels should be low for such low hemoglobin.3. An hemogram with iron studies and vit B12 and folic acid assay can help in identifying the cause. Correction of the specific nutrition through oral and injectables is necessary for improvement of anemia.4. If it continues, other cell lines like white blood cells and platelets could also reduce. This could be critical. Also check for protein levels.5. Severe anemia can cause weakness and loss of appetite.

See you are having high eosinophils due to your allergic . This condition is called Atopy. This is a hereditary condition where your body produces excess of Eosinophils in response to dust / Smoke / Cold Air  or certain food or medicines.    The best possible cure is avoidance of the  allergen, dust in your case.            Apart from avoidance there is one more modality of treatment called Allergen Desensitization. In this condition first you will be tested for what dust you are allergic and once that is found you will be injected small but incremental quantities of dust over a period of 6 months .

Doctor also said i have motlity problems with gastric emptying due to symptoms although never tested me for it and so it wasnt really confirmed.  Have been trying to take all the meds prescribed and had trouble with a couple of them.  I have 2 questions, first one is that I have been prescribed motilium for gastric emptying and have taken it maybe 10 times or 10 pills.  It works in helping me digest and empty the stomach as the most uncomfortable thing was that after eating I felt food was still not yet digested and this caused a choking or pressure sensation in my throat and continous belching to get releif.  Motilum does the job.  HoweverI have very bad side effects from the drug.  Anxiety, hot flashes, restlestness, panic and chnge in mood, rining in left ear some dizziness and sometimes headache which is tolerable.  I have tried breaking the pill in half and the effects are a little less but still present.  I am afraid ths pil although sais that it doesnt cross the brain barrier but it could, actually is doing so in me or I simply cant tolerate it.  I am sensitive to this kind of medication since after trying reglan I literally went crazy!! impossible to take for me.  Ie read that many people had side effects to motilium as they got used t the pill and then things got better. Due to all the symptoms from the different thing found in my test I hve been suffering from anxiety and depression.  Ive lost 15 lbs in 1 month simply because im eating half what i normally did.  I am 34 yo male, 6´1 and current weight is 160lbs.nd  Question is should I continue taking it or should i completley stop the drug nd try getting another drug most probably abraod since there are so few drugs here in the US available to treat this condition.  What should i do?? Second question is that this morning at breakfast i got very anxious after started feeling I had some food not going down and seemed to be stuck in my lower throat or esophagous.  Felt like thick flem and it wasnt my anxiety cause i felt it mainly as i exhaled.  Started feeling light headed, weak and panic was extreme!! I took a protonix to see if it would help since i thought it could be reflux however it didnt really take the sensation away completley.  Im belching fruit that i ate and feeling pretty weak and anxious to say the least.  Still feel something is there and dont know if it is the digestion problem, reflux and or anxiety, hiatal hernia or really something is simply stuck.  Should I go to the ER or should i just let it pass and see how i react after eating dinner?
