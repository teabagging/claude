In ITP, the blood doesn't clot as it should.

But if you have ITP, your immune system attacks and destroys its own platelets.  treatment is the prevention of complications and the lifestyle changes that need to be made.Red foods are key to improved platelet count. Tomatoes, plums, watermelons, cherries and berries are loaded with vitamins and minerals and have strong anti-oxidant properties which helps to raise platelet count. Vegetables such as broccoli, spinach, beet root juice ,bitter gourd  vegetables  are loaded with antioxidants and rich in vitamins and minerals which are believed to reduce inflammation and help increase platelet count.To increase platelet counts, consult your doctor to take a multi-vitamin containing a high dose of vitamin A, B ,C, D, and K. also include the foods containing these vitamins in your diet. Take a lot of vitamin C supplements. You can obtain vitamin C from fruits and vegetables as well.

Any suggestion please suggest which specialized doctor should i consult??","Doctor":"Hello,a risen SGPT level is not enough for a full assessment of your health status. SGPT can be elevated in many diseases. It could be serious ones like hepatitis and cancer or less serious like fatty liver. Other liver function tests would be helpful like SGOT, ALP and gamma-GT. A complete medical history is very important as well. Did you do an ultrasound of the abdomen?- have you ever had hepatitis?- do you take any drugs?- any chronic medical condition?- any symptoms? Pain? Nausea? etc- Have you ever had a blood transfusion?- do you use illicit drugs?- did you ever have a sexual partner who had hepatitis?- are you overweight?These are some basic questions that need answers for a better evaluation of your situation.A general practitioner or an internist should be able to guide you through the first basic assessment. He can refer you to specialists later if he needs to.Young people usually have benign conditions. Many people have slightly increased SGPT (less than three times the normal range) because of fatty liver.Of course I can't suggest a diagnosis based on your SGPT alone.As I already told you, your doctor should guide you to the next step.If you need me to clarify anything, please ask!I hope I've given you some insight on your situation.If you're satisfied with my answer then please don't forget to send a \\"thank you\\".Kind Regards!"},{"Patient":"helo doctor iam sowdamini unmarried ,resently my blood was tested that gives positive result for hbsag is there any danger to present and future i mean for marrage? my father is worried very much about me please give me the clear details and suggestions.thank you","Doctor":"Hello,I'm afraid this single piece of information is not enough for a complete answer but I'll do my best to give you the most clear picture I can.HbsAg is the surface antigen of hepatitis B virus. This if found in the blood after the body gets infected with hepatitis B (acute hepatitis). If it is detected for more than 6 months after infection then this is called 'chronic hepatitis'. Chronic hepatitis could be active or inactive (carrier). The active state is the most dangerous one both for you and for the others. Transmission can occur during the carrier state as well. 1 out of 4 carriers develop active chronic hepatitis. If you do not have an active disease then you cannot do much about it (treatment is not indicated).Your girlfriend/spouse can protect herself by immunization, unless she's already infected too.If you need further clarifications on your condition, please ask again, including more information from serologic testing.I hope I've addressed your concerns!Kind Regards!"},{"Patient":"I have a DVT in left leg and am curious is smoking marijuana compared to cigarettes puts me at risk or if marijuana will affect me as ive also got a blood clotting disorder and am a geno 4 type MTHFR.

I take 2 sodium bicarbonate tablets twice daily,  my creatinine and my nephrologist says that I have acidosis.  I take 2 sodium bicarbonate tablets daily;  my creatinine and bun are also elevated,  can you help me understand acidosis?","Doctor":"Hello,If your creatinine and blood urea are high, your doctor would have told you that your kidney function is reduced. Acid is normally produced in the body by the metabolic processes that sustain us. This is excreted by the kidneys so that the blood is kept at the normal pH. When the kidney function is reduced, the kidneys cannot excrete the acid and acid builds up in the blood and the pH drops below normal. If it drops low, it interferes with the normal functioning of the body and one can become very sick. Also certain electrolytes like Potassium may rise to a high level to interfere with the rhythm and functioning of the heart. So it is important to correct the excess acid in the blood. Sodium bicarbonate is an alkali. It neutralises acid and helps in maintaining the pH at the normal level so that your systems function better.I am available if you have further queries.Take careDr. Noble Zachariah"},{"Patient":"I have been diagnosed with high iron count in my blood.

I have been drinking alcohol, however stopped drinking for last 4 months and have only had alcohol on 4 occasions in last 4 months. however the day I consume, the pain comes back the next day. Is there a problem with my liver? How many days of abstinence will heal it? I am 38, male, weigh 88 Kg and 7.7 hieght","Doctor":"Hi! Good evening. I am Dr Shareef answering your query.The pain in your stomach immediately after drinking alcohol might be due to acute gastritis at that moment, as alcohol is an irritant to the gastric and esophageal mucosa.  The dull pain on the right side of your abdomen could be due to anything ranging from inflammation of the liver to an infection in the gall bladder, and more so could be due to a developing inflammation in the pancreas which is very common in those who consume alcohol. The extent of damage to any of these organs could be judged by a clinical examination by a physician along with related investigations for liver and pancreas like LFT, serum amylase, serum lipase, and an ultrasound/CT scan of the abdomen. Management would depend on the reports of these investigations.However, it is not known why you indulge in alcohol inspite of knowing that it could damage your liver,and other organs as well. The main treatment of your condition is total abstinence from alcohol, and this only your strong determination could do, and no one else. I am sure, you could do this, as you have come out to discuss your problem with the doctor. When you know what is a poison for you, you have got all the reasons to leave it.I hope this information would help you in discussing with your family physician/treating doctor in further management of your problem.

I have a history of panic attacks, and this occurs during them, but at the moment, I am not having an attack.  Could this be something other than stress?","Doctor":"Hi,Thank you for your query. I can understand your concerns.It is  not a vein but an artery, more specifically, the superficial temporal artery which pulsates.It is a branch of  the external carotid artery. It occurs in anxiety disorders.Pulses can be abnormally strong when the patient has an elevated pulse pressure.  This would result in a strong, bounding pulse that could also be asymmetric due to anatomic variation.Bounding pulse -commonly seen in hyperkinetic circulatory states where there is vasodilatation and increased stroke output. The pulse volume is high (due to high pulse pressure) with increased blood flow.Hyperkinetic circulatory states may due to excitement/anxiety. Other causes of hyperkinetic circulatory states giving rise to bounding pulse are Hyperthyroidism,Severe anemia,Beri Beri (thiamine deficiency),Arterio-venous fistula (e.g.  Paget's disease or hepatic failure).The most rapidly rising bounding pulse are found in AR(aortic regurgitation), PDA(patent ductus arteriosus), coarctation of aorta.Regards Dr. T.K.

I have been experiencing headaches in the last week. Why is my bottom number so low?","Doctor":"Hello,the readings you mentioned are not abnormal. Actually they happen quite often. Your diastolic blood pressure (60mmHg) should not cause you any troubles. The systolic blood pressure (88mmHg) could potentially cause symptoms of faintness but please note that there are many individuals who have that kind of readings without any problem at all. This is a rather common reading in young women.Symptoms of low blood pressure are usually vision disturbances (like if the lights went out), cold sweating and the feeling you're going to pass out. Headaches usually have nothing to do with it.You haven't mentioned your medical history so I can't tell whether these readings seem normal or could be due to drug side effects etc. If you're taking antihypertensive medications then you should discuss with your doctor about possible dosage changes.If you'd like to provide more information like - your usual blood pressure readings.- your medical history- the drugs you're taking (if you do)- your age- your sexthen I'll be glad to give you a more specific answer.I hope I've addressed your concerns!Kind Regards!"},{"Patient":"My WBC has been elevated for the past 3 years.

When I stick to the protocol I feel fine. A couple times now on days when I have been out of town and ate a little bit different foods, I wake up at about 2 in the morning with a pretty bad pain in my right side. Below my ribs and to the side of my abdomen. It usually lasts for a couple hours. But during that time is pretty horrible. What could this be and how could I prevent it?","Doctor":"Hi ! Good afternoon. I am Dr Shareef answering your query.If I were your doctor, I would not advise you for any chemical or drug treatment for reducing your weight but for regular exercises. Fast reduction in weight might give rise to gall stones, which might be responsible for your pains after food from outside. Apart from this, food from outside might also get intestinal infections with it and cause your symptoms. Therefore, I would advise you to go for a routine stool test for ova and cyst, and an ultrasound abdomen, and also a serum amylase and lipase if you are used to consume alcohol. Till the investigation reports are out, you could go for a proton pump inhibitor, along with a probiotic and an anti spasmodic drug. Further management would depend on the reports of clinical examination of your abdomen, and the reports of investigations.I hope this information would help you in discussing with your family physician/treating doctor in further management of your problem.

I understand you are worried about that some problems might inherit to your chilren. Let me assure you there is no harm to your marriage, if you are a diabetic or what blood group you have.  Regarding your childrens i must say, if you are a man with type 1 diabetes, the odds of your child developing diabetes are 1 in 17.If you are a woman with type 1 diabetes and your child was born before you were 25, your child's risk is 1 in 25; if your child was born after you turned 25, your child's risk is 1 in 100.If both you and your partner have type 1 diabetes, the risk is between 1 in 10 and 1 in 4.In general, if you have type 2 diabetes, the risk of your child getting diabetes is 1 in 7 if you were diagnosed before age 50 and 1 in 13 if you were diagnosed after age 50.Some scientists believe that a child's risk is greater when the parent with type 2 diabetes is the mother. If both you and your partner have type 2 diabetes, your child's risk is about 1 in 2.  In my opinion, there is no harm in marrying her. I wish you best of luck.Hope I have answered your query.

When they drew my blood they found low hemoglobin count and low platelet count but did not suggest leukemia yet I am worried about the possibility of it, because I often suffer dizziness and extreme fatigue. This is a good hospital would they have found or at least thought of something this serious or could it have been overlooked.thank you I am extremely concerned","Doctor":"Hello,         I would suggest you to completely relax and not worry about it. Feeling dizzy and early fatigue on walking is a common symptom with anaemia(low hemoglobin count). Low hemoglobin count in blood decreases your capacity of red blood cells in your blood to carry oxygen, so your brain, muscles and other parts of the body has decreased oxygen supply, which manifests as dizziness and fatigue        Low platelet count causes bleeding ( only if it is too low i.e. below 50,000) and hence anemia and fatigue. It doesn't cause dizziness and fatique directly.         As you said the doctor has already done your blood tests and they havent suggested it, which makes it very unlikely for you to have leukemia. For your information the cells count in blood increases in leukemia but they are immature.

I am Dr Shareef answering your query.If I were your doctor, I would advise you not to eat from outside like fried, oily, or fast food, as intestinal infections could creep in through these and also in some the intestinal mucosa is sensitive to some of the components of this food resulting in such symptoms of yours. I would advise you to get your stool tested for ova and cyst, and get it treated if positive. Apart from this, you should go for more of roughage and enough liquids in your diet. Also a regular exercise might help you to a great extent.

If such a patient comes to my clinic, i would ask more questions like- for how long do you have these symptoms like fatigue, headache, changes in color of your hands and feet- Do these changes occur in cold or hot environment?- Do you feel pain or tingling sensation in your hands or are they numb?- how often does headache occur and what incite it?- have you got diabetes or any previous heart disease?- Do you smoke?- Do you often forget things? how is your memory?- have you got any tremors recently?- Do blood tests like CBC, LFT's, RFT's and fundoscopy for blurring of vision.- Echocardiography to know the current status of your heart. Besides poor blood circulation can occur due to prolong immobility, maybe because of your job.Hope i have satisfied you to my best. I am here to answere if you still have any queries.

In alcoholic liver disease, the AST(SGOT) :ALT (SGPT) ratio usually exceeds 2. This is partially explained by the depletion in alcoholics of pyridoxal 5-phosphate, the biologically active form of vitamin B6 which is necessary for the activity of both enzymes and is depleted in alcoholics.In alcoholic hepatitis and in contrast to other causes of fatty liver, the AST and ALT are usually elevated two- to sevenfold. They are rarely >400 IU, and the AST/ALT ratio >1 AST(SGOT), which is derived from alcoholic damage to mitochondria or smooth muscle, is more increased than the ALT (SGPT) which is confined to the liver.In your case ALT  level is elevated and more than AST,which is also elevated.I will suggest you to undergo serum g-GT (gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase)- a widely used screening test for alcohol abuse.

I can understand your concerns.Hyperuricemia (serum uric acid level > two standard deviations from the mean or > 7 mg/dl in males or> 6 mg/dl in females) may occur  due to under-excretion of uric acid (renal impairment/ Chronic renal disease ).Hyperuricaemia occurs in 5-84%  of recipients of solid organ transplants. In transplant recipients, therapy with ciclosporin (cyclosporin) is an additional risk factor.Exercise-induced hyperuricemia may result from decreased renal excretion of uric acid, increased synthesis of uric acid, or a combination of these two factors. It has been demonstrated that the main cause of exercise-induced hyperuricemia is not the decreased excretion but the increased synthesisof uric acid, which is a result of excessive adenine nucleotide degradation in skeletal muscle.Intense muscle contraction leads to adenine nucleotide degradation and further to the formation of uric acid precursors, inosine and hypoxanthine in skeletal muscle.High uric acid levels after vigorous exercise is due to  the prolonged release of hypoxanthine from skeletal muscle that  leads to the prolonged production of uric acid in liver.Since you are already having risk factors for hyperuricemia,you are advised to do only aerobic exercise,not weight exercise.Regards Dr. T.K.

My GP directed me to continue the same warfarin dosage and have INR check in a week for further directions","Doctor":"Hi,Thank you for your query. I can understand your concerns.Amoxicillin oral increases effects of warfarin oral .  INR levels may increase.Use with caution ;Although the mechanism for this interaction is not fully known, it is suspected that a decrease in vitamin K-producing gut flora with resulting vitamin K deficiency would be the most likely contributing factor. Using warfarin together with amoxicillin may increase the risk of bleeding, especially if you are elderly or have kidney or liver impairment. You may need more frequent monitoring of your prothrombin time or INR by your doctor to safely use both medications.However some study did not find Amoxiclav(amoxicillin/clavulanic acid) modifying anticoagulation in patients treated with stable warfarin therapy and without infection.This may explain your INR not going up with concurrent amoxycillin therapy.Regards Dr. T.K.

We cannot predict directly without the presence of the patient.

I was diagnosed with higher TSH in July 2010 and have been on thyroxine (50 mg) since then. But the TSH level remains uncontrolled. Now gradually since two months I am experiencing depression, anxiety, palpitations, hair fall, mood swings and difficult PMS. My doctor has prescribed sertraline. What should I do?","Doctor":"Hi! Thanks for consulting with health care magicThe normal range for TSH is 0.4 - 4.0 (mIU/L).  Having a high level of TSH is sensitive for primary hypothyroidism; this means your thyroid gland is under-active.  The spectrum of  hypothyroidism includes several of the symptoms you are experiencing such as depression and brittle hair.  Please let me know if you are experiencing any other symptoms of hypothyroidism - These include: constipation, weakness, fatigue, weight gain, dry skin, joint pain and irregular menstrual periods.  The anxiety and palpitations you are experiencing could be a side effect of an autoimmune disorder called Hashimoto's thyroiditis which initially may present with symptoms of hyperthyroidism (due to follicular rupture) before progressing to hypothyroidism.  Do you have an enlarged thyroid gland?   I would recommend having a full thyroid profile work-up and consulting with an endocrinologist.  Levothyroxine is a commonly used medication to replace the thyroid hormone you are lacking.  The sertraline you are taking is a serotonin-specific reuptake inhibitor which means it will help treat your depression and anxiety, but has no effect on thyroid hormones. I hope this helps and do not hesitate to ask if you have any questions.Take care,Dr. Srinivasan"},{"Patient":"On recent blood yest I have very low platelet count..my primary care is sending me to a hemotolgist...until I see him, I was wondering if there is a connection beween this condition and heatitus C, which I have had for at least 15 years ( how I got it is unknown) ?","Doctor":"Hello and welcome to HCM,Low platelet counts can occur due to destruction of platelets or decreased production of platelets in bone marrow.Thus, consultation with a hematologist will help to determine the cause of low platelet counts.A bone marrow aspiration may be required to look for status of platelet pre-cursors on bone marrow.A chronic hepatitis C infection is unlikely to cause low platelet counts.Thanks and take careDr Shailja P Wahal"},{"Patient":"A recent CBC shows that I am anemic.

Low iron levels with high hemoglobin levels, could indicate early stages of iron deficiency anemia, where all iron is being used up.2. 11.6g/dl is not high. It is well below the normal range. High is if it is above 18g/dl or 180g/l.3. You need iron supplements along with iron rich diet.4. Other than iron deficiency, there is nothing wrong in bone marrow and you do not have any tumor.Hope it helps.Any further queries, happy to help again."},{"Patient":"I haven t gotten my period.

This disease is named Kabuki because of the resemblance of the features of the face of the patients suffering from this disorder with the make up used in the japanese theatres , and in Japan ic called  Kabuki. The  disease occurs in nearly 3 in 100,000 newborns. Curiously in the patients where Kabuki syndrome is caused by mutations in the KMT2D gene, the disease is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern, so one copy of the altered gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the disorder, but when  Kabuki syndrome  is caused by mutations in the KDM6A gene, it is inherited in an X-linked dominant pattern and in this case the father cannot pass X- linked traits to the sons. Most cases of this disorder are sporadic,and this means that the genetic mutation  can occur in an individual for the first time and is not inherited from his parents. This means that, parents with a child with Kabuki syndrome generally do not have an increased risk of having another child with this disorder.it is a rare disorder and cannot be cured.

Most common cause of anemia is nutritional deficiency of iron, vitamin B12 and/ or folic acid. Dizziness is one of the commonest symptoms of anemia.2. When you are diagnosed with anemia, it becomes important to know the type of anemia as well. Get complete hemogram done along with peripheral blood smear examination to know the type of anemia and take treatment accordingly.3. It takes at least two weeks for the symptoms to improve with oral therapy. If its been more than two weeks get a reticulocyte count done to check for response, meanwhile discuss with your consultant the use of injectable forms of iron therapy as iron absorption might be hindered by worms sometimes. 4. Also get a deworming done for hookworm.5. Improve on your nutrition by having more cereals, citrus fruits, red meat( rich in iron and other micro nutrients). 6. Be regular on your medicines, take lots of fluids and avoid tea as tannins inhibit iron absorption.Hope this helps.Regards"},{"Patient":"My dad is taking proxyvon (Darvocet) tablet for more than 24 years, around  18 - 23 pills per day. he is 65 yrs old now.

Can it be a reason for acne? I've been suffering from it for 5 years. I had 2 surgeries on my chest, 10 years ago and last year. Could it be the reason for high prolactin level and how i can check it?","Doctor":"Hello, very sad to hear from you. If I am your advising Doctor high prolactin level in male is only a pathogenic. There are many causes of prolactinomas one is MEN syndrome. which comprises of many endocrinal tumors. I suspect that you have MEN Syndrome because the operative history which you are giving is leading to suspect diagnosis. But your acne is not because of high prolactin level. Most common tumor which produce prolactin is at anterior pitutary gland. So you must go for MRI test to detect the Tumor. If you have any further querry I would be glad to answer it.

Looking at your complaints my opinion is as follows.1. Causes of High blood pressure is multifactorial. Apart from the parameters you mentioned, there are other factors too like stress, lifestyle, type of personality, exercise and workout, nutrition, history of hypertension/diabetes in family, history of myocardial infarction in family, hypercholesterolemia which contribute to pressures. 2. Keep a checklist on the factors I have mentioned and if your answer is yes to any or few of those then chances of developing hypertension and complications arising out of hypertension is more.3. Get a lipid profile tested to rule out high cholesterol as possible cause.4. If your BP reading is consistently high on multiple occasions then its better to start on antihypertensives, and make necessary lifestyle modifications.Hope this helps.

Then, considering your rather high BMI (36.91) which puts in the obese category one would also have to look at the presence of the so called METABOLIC SYNDROME of which high blood sugar is a part. If you do have diabetes then hearing loss secondary to diabetes becomes another possibility. The message therefore islook at the hearing defect holistically - both from the point of view of local issues (fluid in the ear etc) as well as more distant causes like anemia, diabetes and so on.

Good morning. I am Dr Shareef answering your query. If I were your doctor, I would advise you for an ultrasound of abdomen to rule out any pelvic pathology like endometriosis for this kind of cyclical pain. If you are sexually active immediately post partum, a missed pregnancy could not be ruled out and an ultrasound might help in that. If you eat from outside, avoid it as it might cause cramping due to intestinal infection.In case of persistent cramping, you could take a second opinion from a gynaecologist in your area.I hope this information would help you in discussing with your family physician/treating doctor in further management of your problem.

Once go for complete ANA profile. and diagnose accurately. you must have some systemic disorder. your thyroid and hep C may be related to that or may not. so first you diagnose your systemic autoimmune disease. take treatment for that. it will give you more idea regarding other problems also and make it easy to treat everything. mostly you required steroid treatment. but consult immunologist/ rhumatologist and take treatment accordingly."},{"Patient":"I am a female 24 years old...my latest blood test showed Billrubin levels at 1.5.....I am working with a nutritionisit for past 3 months as I use to drink a lot of alcohol.

I have the following health problems high blood pressure and hypothyrodism","Doctor":"Thank you for the query.I would like to know your age and gender. Hyponatremia (low sodium levels in blood) can arise due to a number of causes like congestive cardiac failure/liver disease (hypervolemic fluid status), SIADH (euvolemic fluid status) and severe diarrhoea (hypovolemic fluid status). However, one of the commonest cause is intake of antihypertensive drugs like diuretics - hydrochlorthiazide and frusemide.Since, you have a history of hypertension, I would like to know your drug regimen. If it comprises of diuretics (like the ones mentioned above), it may be a cause for your hyponatremia. You can go for extra salt in diet and certain amount of fluid restriction which might help. In case you are on diuretics, these may have to be substituted for another class of drugs for hypertension. If you are symptomatic due to hyponatremia (for eg weakness, slowness, confusion etc), you may need to visit your physician for a thorough physical checkup and further investigations.In some cases hypertonic saline may need to transfused, in a hospital setting, though in your case, it is not required at this moment. Vaptans are a group of drugs administered for Hyponatremia (hypervolemic and euvolemic) under a physician's guidance.Hope this helps you out."},{"Patient":"I have Lupus Anticoagulant and have quit taking cumadin and taking Pradaxa.

Get confirmed by clinical examination done by a General Surgeon, get a prescription for painkillers and get an appointment for surgery.He may not operate you immediately, will wait till the hernia is well formed.

I'll turn 65.  I suffer from ET (Essential Thrombocytosis).  I was made aware of the possibility of this condition in 1995 during a routine office visit by my cardiologist.  The cardiologist couldn't get a definitive blood count after a routine CBC was taken and referred me to a hematologist.  Several tests, including bone marrow aspiration, were taken to determine what was going on with my blood.  Turned out to have a blood disorder called ET rendering my platelet count in the low one-millions.  I was immediately put on Anagrelide which I stayed on for approx. 4 years.  But because of severe side affects, specifically palpitations which this hematologist didn't seem to consider serious, given my condition, I sought the services of yet another specialist.  I was introduced to hydroxyurea in high doses which brought about a whole different set of problems.  Where the palpitations were alayed, I began noticing a darkening of my nails, feet and hands, and severe bouts with dizziness, as well as lower back pain, infrequent fatigue, and a host of other side affects caused by this medication.  I was scheduled for another bone marrow aspiration and it was determined that my bone marrow was hardening.  I discussed this with the doctor and advised him that I would no longer take such a high dosage of drugs, thereby having my dosage reduced.  I was not very pleased with this doctor and consequently did some extensive research and ended up with the specialist I now have.  Unlike with the previous specialists, this specialist informed me of other alternatives, none of which of course were holistic, which were explained to me and gave me an opportunity to choose which method of treatment I would rather have.  I opted to stay w/the Hydrea.  I have now been on the Hydrea for 11 yrs.  As with all previous specialists, and with medication, as I am monitored every 3-4 months, my platelets have continued to be in the mid-500s to 700s.  I currently take 2 500mg hydrea twice a day.  I have read the comments from others who have this condition and we all have similar concerns. . .lukemia, stroke (if med stopped), etc.  What can I do, who can I turn to?  I want to get off this drug, but am fearful of the outcome.","Doctor":"Hi,Welcome to health care magic and thanks for asking.After going through the clinical and drug history, I seem to agree with you.Hydroxyurea, if taken for a long time does lead to increased risk of leukemia. However, if stopped, increased platelet count could lead to increased blood viscosity and chances of stroke are high.Options include regular plateletpheresis or changing over to anagrelide for short periods in between.Other options includes reducing dose and close follow up for development of leukemia and having an option to treat at an early stage.You can also add aspirin to reduce the risk of thrombosis.Any further queries, happy to help again."},{"Patient":"Hello I had a hysterectomy on Aug 7th the day after they found my hemoglobion was 7.8 then by thursday evening it was a 5.9 so the radioligist went in thru a artery in my leg and found a place that was oozing some blood and foamed it up and i had 2 bags of blood gave to me thru IV the next morning it was back up to a 8 and i came home which was Friday.

Good morning. I am Dr Shareef answering your query.The site of pain indicates the location of an chronically inflammed appendix or of the pelvic adnexa and also could be due to a asymptomatic UTI which has not been detected.

I would not hesitate to advise you for a CT scan of your abdomen as the ultrasound has not shown any pathology.

Is this anything i should be worried about? Im 21 year old 168 cm 66 kg and i've got ankylosing spondylitis","Doctor":"Hi,Welcome and thanks for asking. Bilirubin levels are related to hepatic function predominantly. Increased red cell break down or obstruction to bilirubin out flow can also increase it.In the present condition of hepatitis B carrier, the bilirubin increase is due to hepatitis. Inflammation  and damage of the liver is the major cause for raised bilirubin.In your present condition, a raised bilirubin indicates time of hepatic damage and reduced period indicates time of improvement. If it increases beyond normal and persistently, it means it is progressing and risk of cirrhosis is more. At present hepatitis - chronic stage is present.Risk of hepatocellular carcinoma is present in future and routine liver examination is necessary annually.Any further queries, happy to help again."},{"Patient":"Hi, I am Sarmistha .

Hepatitis B, once acquired cannot be cured. You should always need to watch out for complications, commonly cirrhosis and hepatic cancer.2. Your surrounding near and dear ones, with whom you could have accidental exposure should be vaccinated.3. Chronic low WBC count could be medication related. Look at your medications, if any cause bone .arrow suppression.4. If medications are not the cause, bone. Arrow aspiration and biopsy are essential for any diagnosis. Without identifying a cause treatment cannot be started.5. Avoid exposure to anybody infected, as there  is a risk of increased severity due to reduced immunity.Hope it helps.Any further queries, happy to help again ."},{"Patient":"I have low haemoglobin level in blood, and nowadays and especially during my periods i face low blood pressure and internal weakness and if my heart is going down, and i cant eat anything, even when i am really hungry, and i feel like vomiting all the time","Doctor":"Hi,Looking at your clinical history and symptoms, I think you might be having severe anemia.The symptoms of dizziness and cardiac symptoms are severe and with your diet problems, malnutrition is definitely present.Following are my recommendation for you.1.

She said that the probability of having a child with genetic disorder or health defects is really high. Is this really true?","Doctor":"Hi,After going through the details, its my opinion that there shouldn't be a problem.When close relations marry, the genetic pool reduces and the mutations increase in number. So, the offspring has a higher risk of congenital abnormalities or health defect syndromes due to these mutations.If you are not related, the blood groups should not matter.Among blood groups, if the female is Rh negative and male positive, immune hemolytic disease of newborn may be seen.

Good evening. I am Dr Shareef answering your query.Discomfort in the testis could be due to ignored repeated trivial trauma, which causes inflammation causing pain/discomfort in the same. Testis being an intra-abdominal organ embryo-logically, brings the nerve supply to it from above, and so the pain in the testis is frequently radiated/felt as a discomfort in the abdomen/pelvis area.  In your case your urinary tract infection might have spread to the testes giving rise to such pain in the testes.If I were your doctor, after a thorough physical examination I would advise you for the following:1) Support your testes with properly fitting under garments.2) Avoid standing for prolonged period, and avoid lifting heavy weight if you do.3) Advise you for a routine blood tests like a CBC, AEC, HbsAG, HIV test and a urine routine/microscopic examination followed by a culture and sensitivity report if need be and advise antibiotics as per the report.4) Avoid indulgence in any sexual activity if you are active sexually which would prevent further trivial trauma if any to the testes, apart from precipitating any kind of infection if present.I hope this information would help you in discussing with your family physician/treating doctor in further management of your problem.
