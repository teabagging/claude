Get you ECG done to know if quetiapine is causing these effects. It can cause QT prolongation2. Take the opinion of you treating psychiatrist to find whether you have co-morbid panic disorder with bipolar disorder. This is common.3. Keep a regular check on your blood pressure, cholesterol and weight as quetiapine can cause metabolic disturbances.4.

We cleaned carpets, walls, patios, back screened porch. A real mess that we had not seen with our one first visit. It was on a lake in a nice older community with land. That was the main draw. MISTAKE... By the time we had it all ready to move in six weeks later, I was raw and broke out on hands , legs the worst. Thought it was cleaning chemicals. But it became worse after we were settled in. Not using chemicals any more. I went to 8 doctors, three were skin specialests over the next 5 years, They ruined my immune system with shots, cream, pills of steroids. Finally I refused them. They would not do tests on what I showed them, on slides. Did not seem to care. They thought I was funny farm material. I gave up and did my own research on every insect i could find, Bought air pure machines etc. Doubled up on my vits. One specialist even told me to stop taking them period. I started feelind bad so started taking them again after two months. I tried many things. Found NUTRASILVER, have been taking it for two years, it is helping I am 70 % better. I was so infested it takes a long time to clean the body inside and out. I became almost blind, but I take VISION CLEAR and my sight has improved. Now my question is what damage o they do to the brain, do not have a problem ? But I worry. I dig them off in herb baths. They make bloody mounds, proving they are in my blood system and organs. I have to scrub and rince several times. I stay home mostly, afraid of infecting others. My large family live 2000 miles away, contact is phone and e-mail. Do not want them or others to suffer as I have. I have a lot of parasites on sticky tape in zip lack bags. My question; is there anything that really works and will I ever be able to clean my body of this horror ? I would appreciate any advice. I am other wise quite healthy take no meds at my age. Sincerely, Carol ...age 77... in YYYY@YYYY ....","Doctor":"Hello, Welcome to Health Care MagicI can understand your problem. You have developed symptoms of Morgellone after moving in new house which you suspected to be infested. Since last 5 years you have consulted many doctors with no relief. Dermatologist opinion probably also resulted in nothing. Such type of symptoms at your age could occur due to some psychotic disorder most likely Delusional Parasitosis though detailed evaluation is required to make proper diagnosis. Meficines like antidepressants and antipsychotic drugs have excellent roles in such symptoms. Fluoxetine and Olanzapine can help to improve the symptoms.Consult a psychiatrist for prescription of drugs.Thanks"},{"Patient":"I have been feeling dizzy for 5 weeks, tinnitus, ear pressure and recently diagnosed with hemochromatosis.

So I ll just write from my childhood till my married life now. I am 28 years old now. So, when I was a child. My mom always complained that I didn t have good grade and was a bad girl at school. She will yell at me whenever she has to meet the teacher at parents meeting day. Also, I was bullied at school, but when i told her she simply say it s because I was a bad girl that I will get bullied. I was bullied because I was too quiet and shy at school. Those I thought was my friend bullied me. During my high school, I went to a bad school, which luckily closed down, so I was transferred to a better high school. To tell you how bad it was, my somewhat friend stole my gel pens that I was collecting when I was little. They stole it in front of me and didn t want to give back to me. During art class, a student asked the teacher how to draw a dragon. At that time, I happen to wear a dragon t-shirt. The teacher told the student to look at my shirt. I felt intimidated since the student, a guy, was looking non-stop at my breast to draw a dragon. I told my mom later, she replied he was only looking at the dragon. Don’t over think . At Cegep, I helped my mom at her restaurant part-time. However, at University, i wanted to stop since it was too hard for my psychology program. I was almost failed the school. At the end of my graduation, i could never reach neither master nor doctorate degree, but manage to graduate from my bachelor degree with a average grade but not enough to go higher into master. To graduate, I had to study part-time, and continued on during summer vacation. I took me more years to graduate. If I didn’t help he at the restaurant, she would kick me out of the house. My parents, mom never really wanted to celebrate my graduation from elementary,high school,cegep nor my university. However, they still came to high school graduation and university. During high school, i told them i would really want them to go. During university, my husband (bf back then) told them that I really want their presence and he wanted to propose to me on that day. My mom also ruined my proposal day, she told me days before that he was gonna propose to me and to behave properly, My mom really like my boyfriend back then. Later on, i changed to study as paralegal, i managed to have good grade, always in between 80% to 100%. But whenever, i told her she never congratulated me. When it was not a 100%, she felt it was not a good grade. Therefore, there is no need for compliment. During my adulthood, when I found my husband, back then fiancee. She has to do a whole scene, like in movie, to stop me from being with him because he wasn t her ideal guy. She started to dislike him because he tried to help me. He told my mom that i felt neglected by her. If she could show more affection toward me. My mom took it as a offence and start to dislike him. During the planification of my wedding, I was always sad or crying. She never helped me during the planning but only complained. She didn t accept him nor my wedding but wants to be honoured as my mother during the ceremony. I wanted her during my planification, but she refused our wedding. How could i ask her opinion on something she refused.? After 3 years, i still cry for my ruined wedding. I would be envious whenever i see a mother helping her daughter preparing for her wedding. I feel guilty for this, being happy but yet jealous. I only had help from him and my friends during my wedding. Now being married and finding my job as paralegal, I finally start to find my own sense of identity. But yet she always has to complain about how i dress too office . I work at a law firm!! Whenever i buy a new clothe, i am afraid to show her. When I got a very good raise by my boss, i didn t want to tell her. Feeing it would not be enough, i didn t not ear the 25/hour as a new paralegal. She always complained that i wasn t like before, i changed since I have a job. I find my self-identity, i started to develop my own view of things and i am more open. I only found this while i am away from her. I start to notice that i could get mad at people at times, i could tell them that i don t share their view. My friend told me that i change, i wasn t as quiet and shy as before. I noticed at work that when a coworker or even my manager made an error, i could simply nicely told them they made a error or left out some information. They would simply correct the mistake. At time, I also get praised when did something good. My mom simply has to tell me that it a way to keep you working hard. I agree some praise may be real, some praise may simply to keep up appreciated and keep working. But that simple praise made me feel worthy and it worked. I waited soo long from her that i eventually gave up. She told me that she like the previous me, that i changed. Before, i had to listen to her because I was dependant on her financially. Now, I have a job and i can live on my own. I don t have to act according to her fearing i might be left out on the street. She always complain how I look fat, but I m wearing small. I do gym everyday and like my body. I wish she could stop. Now I am so tired, that I don’t really want to meets her. I only go because i want to meet my sister and she is the only one of the family who understands and accepts me.. I only use my sister as I way to say I go visit her.Each time i see her, i always end up reminding me of unhappy things. However, I noticed that since I was deprived of motherly love as a childhood, now I have become very dependent and clingy on my husband. I placed on the affection I lacked on him. I always ask for his attention ,like a attention freak. I felt he was the only one who love me. I am afraid i will push him away. He still loves me now, but I feel i am over controlling him, always needing for this care and attention. Whenever we argue over something, I start to think no one loves me.. i am alone. Could you please help me, I dont want to live in the past.l I dont want to be burdened by my mom and be her puppet. Nor do I want to burden my husband that love me solo much. i want to be more independant. I want to live my own life the way and be myself. I also wanted to tell you that i started to gather my courage to tell her how i fee about her, but yet she never took it too seriously. Saying it was for my own good. Before i would never tell her, fearing it might cause a chaos. I am very thankful of you to take the time to read my long story. I am very at lost what to do.","Doctor":"DearWe understand your concernsI went through your details. I suggest you not to worry much. Anxiety is fear of something which may or may not be true or may or may not happen in the future. Anxiety is known to produce so many weird symptoms which has no physiological back up.

But everyone do know they have no control over such future events and therefore it is futile to think and worry about them. Secondly, nobody has enough time to think about it. Thirdly everyone are busy living, there is no other alternative except living properly. There is no escape in thinking what shall happen in future with the relationship.

Most likely the high BP is due to White Coat Hypertension. This is psychological rise in BP while entering a hospital and it may also present with other symptoms of anxiety. But you are having palpitations, restlessness which couldn't be explained by anxiety alone. Most likely the reason for such symptoms is panic attacks with anxiety. You are already on HRT for menopausal syndrome and this also increases the risk of such symptoms. I would advise you to consult a psychiatrist for such symptoms. Some medicines like Propranolol, Atenolol which are beta blocker drugs are used to reduce the palpitations and this will also help to decrease BP. Instead of HRT for hot flashes medicines like Duloxetine can be used. The medicine will help to reduce mood swings and will also help in anxiety.Visit a psychiatrist for prescription of these drugs.Thanks, hope this helps you."},{"Patient":"Hi, My name is Matt. I am a male 22 year old with a Filipino heritage and no family history of mental illnesses that I know of except Alzheimers. For a few years now I see things at night. I'm not sure what they are.

Or when I do \\"know\\" what they are, i'll forget what it was. No I don't hear voices, and I only \\"see\\" things when it is dark and I am trying to sleep. I am mentally and physically compitent.

Its called hypnogogic hallucination which is occur while we are in trans stage. When we try to sleep we are in between conscious and unconscious mind and its called trans phase.It is normal and no require any treatment. If it is occurring in day time or associated with auditory hallucination or voices then require psychological intervention.Relax and do not think about that. It will gradually decrease with time.If still persist then consult psychiatrist for further help.Hope i have answered your query.Thank you."},{"Patient":"Hi. I have a history of anxiety and the way it got diagnosed is I go through periods where I constantly feel like I'm having trouble breathing. It just feels like I'm breathing through a straw that has a hole in it and I'm not getting all the air. This caused a panic attack and I got put on medication. Well, about a year ago, I came off the medication because I thought I was fine. Just now this breathing thing started again like last week. Today has been the worst. I don't feel anxious. Could this really just be anxiety?","Doctor":"Hello.You have been diagnosed with panic disorder in past. Now again you are having your breathing problems which were initially considered to be a part of anxiety disorder.I think you are having a relapse of panic disorder. For treatment you should practice relaxation exercises like deep breathing and meditation. Biofeedback therapy under a psychologist's guidence can also prove useful.If you still have doubts, you can go for pulmonary function tests to test lung function and check for any breathing disorder.Hope this helps you.Thanks."},{"Patient":"My husband suffers from major depressive disorder, recurrent, with suicidal component for the past 15 years.

This Wednesday there will be a meeting at the hospital to discuss his case. Many combinations of meds were tried, including ECT.  Do you have any suggestion?","Doctor":"HelloWelcome here.I can understand your concerns.I think your husband is having recurrent depression and most probably resitant depression. However, revisiting the diagnosis by a psychiatrist to rule out a comorbid condition like psychosis is advisable.In such cases ECT is the best treatment.

If he does wishes to take medicines, you can consult a psychotherapist for cognitive behavior therapy sessions.Hope this helps.Thanks."},{"Patient":"My son was aditted in the hospital for Psychosis..

Thank you Sherri","Doctor":"Hello thanks for asking from HCMHe was admitted in hospital for psychosis and now he is refusing to take medicines and is getting aggressive while asking for medicines. He is also at risk of hurting himself. As per my opinion as he is having psychotic episode and is refusing to take medicines then he can be given long acting anti-psychotic drugs in injectable form. Drugs like Fluphenazine are available in injectable form and provide protection for unto 15 days. Other option is to give him drugs without his knowledge by mixing with food. Drugs like Risperidone, Olanzapine (Both anti-psychotics) are available in tasteless and odourless form and can be mixed with food or liquids. As you are his father and primary caregiver, visit his psychiatrist and discuss about these options, he should improve with these methods.Thanks, hope this helps you."},{"Patient":"I am really worried about burgulars or bad people entering my home at night and am extremely worried about how I would manage to get my daughter out if this was to happen.

He has been incredibly stressed over work and recent death in the family and started feeling depressed and anxious. The first couple of days he took lorazepam, the anxiety level seemed to have gone down and he seemed more relaxed. Then a few days into it, I started noticing that he seemed more anxious, more unhappy and completely depressed. He just wants to sleep all day and cannot seem to function at all. He seems worse than before he started his meds. The other medication he is taking is Lexapro 10mg once a day. I think he may be taking the wrong meds for him, especially the lorazepam. His doctor told him to take 2-3 lorazepam per day vs 4 when my roommate called him to tell him that he is feeling worse than ever before. He also takes antabuse which he has been taking for a year now, everyday, without missing one single dose. I am not sure lorazepam is the correct anti anxiety pill for an alcoholic taking antabuse.  Should he start weaning off lorazepam? How? He's only been on it for a week. He only took one dose today and he's a big mess. He said he feels so anxious and tired. He looks like he's about to have a breakdown and physically he just looks miserable. Should he be weaning off Lexapro (escitalopram) as well? If so, how? Please help. I want to help my friend. He will be seeing another doctor early next week (earliest he can see one due to the holiday) but would love you know how I can help in the meantime.","Doctor":"HelloWelcome here.I can understand your concerns for your friend.I have some suggestion for you:Antabuse drugs are usually not prescribed for longer durations. As soon as the person feels that he has string enough will power, there is no role of antabuse drugs further.Lorazepam,  at doses which your friend is taking, should decrease his anxiety.Now if his anxiety has increased even after takibg lorazepam, this is most probably due to interaction between antabuse and lorazepam.Lexapro is an anti-depressant and anti-anxiety drug. However in some cases it can increase anxiety for initial few days.My advice for your fruend would be just to take single drug lorazepam till he sees his doctor. Antabuse can be tapered off by reducing one-third dose every three days and lexapro can be stopped for now.Hope this helps.Thanks"},{"Patient":"thank you for your time.

He has shown improvement in depression but still have features of social phobia. Now he has been advised to take Venlafaxine 75 mg in addition to Fluoxetine. Venlafaxine is a SNRI drug and it can help in social anxiety. It is safe to use and free of serious side effects. You can think of giving this drug to him. But other option is to increase the dose of fluoxetine. He is on 20 mg per day which as per my opinion is low dose considering his symptoms. Also as per guidelines if he has symptoms even with drug first option should be to increase the dose. Increasing the doses to 40-60 mg will help to control his anxiety.

Obsessions are repetitive thoughts, ideas or impulses that are dominating, distressing and occurs in mind persistently. They produce significant distress to individual. In order to prevent the distress individual tries to do some ritualistic behaviour that are called as compulsions. The symptoms your son is showing like putting thing in a particular manner can be due to Obsession of Orderliness, which is a common type of obsession, though detailed evaluation is needed to make diagnosis.

Having dfficulty in trusting people and suspiciousness can be due different causes. It can be due to person's personality - such as a paranoid personality or due to psychiatric disorders like psychosis. In your case, since you seem to be having a understanding into your problem, it is unlikely to be due to a psychotic disorder. So, it is more likely that you are having paranoid personality traits which are causing you to suspect and mistrust your girlfriend. In such a case, the treatment for your problem would be psychotherapy (counselling). I would advise you to consult a psychiatrist in your place and go for regular psychotherapy sessions. It would also be a good idea to discuss about your problem openly with your girlfriend so that you avoid relationship problems.Regards,Dr. Jonas SundarakumarConsultant Psychiatrist"},{"Patient":"I am suffering from depression for last 5 years,loosing confidence,sensitivity towards family members,always remain at home.fear from any lound sound,anxity.want to take zapiz .25,but fearing from constipation after taking this.is my fear is true.suggest kindly what to do.","Doctor":"Hello,1.

Yes I have been under EXTREME stress since since 07-13-2013 when my beloved husband cast me out of our home that we build together over a 20 year period because I was too sick & sad & not getting better we were married fore 27 beautiful loving years, he demanded a divorce, sellin our house and sending me away on 07-13-2013 to from VT to Ny to be near my father but my father got sick that slept in 2013 & and later died of cancer on 0314-2024; I cared for him with hospice help as he died. I moved into a small house a few mikes a way from my father because him he would not allow me to live with him, which really hurt. Then my little kitty died 08-15-2014, she was only 3.5. I trigger with my health in general but the last year+ has been extreme stress and emotional agony over loss of spouse. I have chronic pain, from a spinal cord fusion back in July 2005 that went very bad, have had 14 kidney stones from 2008-20011 & a botched lithotripsy where they accident lot spot pulses through my body, verses target kidney stone in July 2011 cause many damages to layers & tissues & organs in body, along with an MRI a few weeks later with contrast dye that my body could not get rid off so I end up with severe galladium radiation poisoning at a level measured to be 100000 times max level ( I was so sick) then a few weeks later I provisioned with isovue ( radioactive iodine) during some kind of X-ray, this caused me to get bad neuropathy in fingers nd especially toes. I have a long standing thyroid condition, hypothyroid hosimoto thyroditis ( sp?), but it be well controlled, even thru fall of 2013. I write to you because I beg pcp to check me because I feel so bad, he say no until 11-04-2014, then agree to check a few labs. By now I am feeling so bad it is horrid. My tsh is 140, my t4 is 0.48, my GFR is 36, with very high cholesterol& triglycerides ( in upper 300 s both ) my BP is high 160/120, pulse 60, temp around 97.4, I have ever increasing esophagus spasms with worsening acid coming into mouth all the time since last fall. Dr said to increase my synthroid from 1/2 tab to whole tab which is 0.075 mg daily, which I did on 11-07-2014. I do not feel any better, I actually feel worse & start to have micro burst of very intense heat just lasting 10-20 seconds but very vey severe, immediate followed by bone chilly cold. I have moderate continual flank pain. My liver fund Cation values were not good either. I feel I am in trouble but pcp wants to wait 4-6 weeks to recheck va,use, I am not ok with this as I feel worse not better, ,I ve alone and do not know how much more I can handle. 1) What do you think might have caused tsh to get to be so, given I taken my synthroid faithfully same way for 15+ years? (Stress). 2). How do I recover ASAP from this as I live alone and can not endure much more, waiting weeks to see I I am headed in right direction seems wrong given I feel so bad. What is protocol for cases like mine that are a bit complicated. I take a large menu of meds to control ago keying spinal cord pain. Current pcp yanked me totally off all supplements last week, each one which had been carefully selected to help me for a specific reason, ie mg glycinate for leg cramps, iodine to help thyroid. Also my vit was very low but I was taking 5000 iu daily in a special blend with A. & K in it to help absorption., but I am not aborning much of anything well. Also because of spinal cord injury intestines do not peristalsis correctly, big issue. Any recommendation would be appreciated, as I am failing on all fronts.

It sounds crazy and unheard of, which is the reason I can t face my doctor with the problem. Also, to the contrary of treating the pain with anything that slows me down, I have found that stimulants are more effective by far, during this horrible quest to survive.

I ve always had issues with my parents and some differences of beliefs that we ve had but It really all started when two years ago my mom cheated on my dad and that s when everything in my life started to go downhill. That day was one of the worst days of my life due to all the screaming, yelling and anger things being thrown and from that moment I thought I would never have that same life with both parents again and I didn t . Even though they stayed together and worked things out my dad became more difficult to talk to. He always considered himself right on everything the way he talked about other people and other races like he was so much higher then them he would yell at the slightest things and it was like walking on egg shells. As months went on I distanced myself more and more from him and my mom as she also became more over protective and crazy. I would ask to go over to friends houses and she would say no multiple times but then she would constantly complain that I m always in my room and that I don t do nothing and have no friends and those little remarks would drive me insane because the more I would tell my friends I couldn t come the lonelier my life felt. My friends suddenly just get tired of asking so much that they don t as much anymore. My mom also made me move schools my junior year to a new school where I knew no one. This broke me for so long because school was the one place I was able to be my crazy outgoing happy self with all my friends and the people I love surrounding me and she took that away. I was a completely different person at school then at home no one would ever know I was unhappy. Being at the new school I would cry for days because of how alone I felt at that point. Because now was I not only sad at home but sad at my new school to. No one talked to me for so long and on my second year here I still don t have that full happiness I used to but do when I get the chance to get together with my friends. When I m with friends It s like every feeling of sadness I have is gone and I m just smiling and talking and laughing the whole time but my parents don t see that. When they say blood is thicker then water I don t feel that way because my friends the people who help me to feel and be my happy self mean more to me. The problem is I never tell anyone my problems I bottle them ,I focus on helping everyonelse but myself and I ve bottled every problem in my life for so long that everytime I try to open up I end up crying and not being able to say the words I need to and then my parents say I m being a baby or just over reacting.

I have beeen dealing with a lot of lack of sleep and disturbed sleep. I was always a little bit of a night hawk ; but only on the nights that I didn t have to get up really early in the morning. Anyways, the bottom line is for the last past while;say the last 2mo. straight I haven t been sleeping much. I blame it on hormones; but it s leaving me feeling very drained and lifeless. Their has been a lot of stress in the last few years; we nearly lost our daughter 2 yrs.ago due to an almost fatal car accident. My mom underwent a major heart surgery; a double by pass; our home has been under major rennovations and my husband travels so a lot of the time, I have to be both parent; mother and father. I still have a little one at home; she s in school but she s still young . I lost my father back in 2006; but in spite of it all; I ve always been really good about anything that came my way. Oh yeah; I ve been dealing with abnormal noncancerous cells in my cervical area. So far so good; but I m not out of the woods yet; I may have to undergo a partial hysterectomy depending on the results coming up this november. I ve always been a really happy, full of life who lived her life to the fullest kind a person. I ve always taken everything in stride. I was always a very easy going type of person. Anyways it s out of character for me to be going through this whatever this is. I hope it s just a phase and I can snap out of it soon. I m not happy right now and I m trying so hard to hide my feelings; because I wanted to believe that i could overcome it without anyone noticing; and that I could fight this depression that i m going through. Anyways, I ended up seeing a doctor recently a wk. ago; and she prescribed medication called Venlafaxine for 7 days; 1 tablet daily.After the week is over, I m suppose to double my dose. Well, Ive only taken it for 2 days, and Ive been experiencing no sleep from the medication and i developed an allergic reaction ; I ended up getting a severe case o hives. So now yesterday was the third day and I did not take the medication . Oh yes, I am also taking a natural, herbal formula 2x a day for my menopausal symptoms; and I am allergic to penicllin; so I don t know what to do. But the positive side was that I noticed how my mood and my emotional state had just changed after 2 days. I was much more happier the second day that i took Venlafaxine. I must tell you that a few years ago; when I was 45, I had gone through a little slight depression so i went to see a doctor and he prescribed citalopram during the day; and Zoplicone for night time and that medication really helped me overcome my depression back then. But this time; I think I waited too long to seek help and I feel I m in a deeper depression more than I know. I totally almost stopped talking and I have always been such a great communicator; I used to have a lot of friends; but my husband is very satisfied with being by himself and he s a little bit of a loner and his job actually doesn t permit him much for socializing; too tired to now that he s getting older. I loved people, and I still do; but i dont feel that I have anything to offer anybody at this time; I feel confused, tired, empty and lonely inside; and I feel that I m sheltering myself; and I feel a lot of anxiety because I know that I m not me right now; The doctor that prescribed me to take Venlafaxine just recently is very young; but she said she s been practicing for 7 years; and I think she s qualified to help me; but I m suppose to go for blood work actually this last week; but I plan to go for sure after Thanks giving. I tried to get a whole of my physician today; but she wasn t around. I was thinking I should talk to a Pharmasist to see if he can offer me some advice about what I should do from here. Can you give me some expert advice on how to deal with myself. Also, I d like to mention that I had a family funeral to attend today; and I didn t take the medication; and I could honestly say that I was very alert for driving, but at the memorial service; I knew people their even my own immediate family; and I didn t know how to truly connect with them. Me was their, but not the 100% me. It was my sister s husband s mother who passed away due to a long battle of cancer. She was a very courageous woman; and it was very emotional for everyone; and I had become very close to her also given the little bit of time that I ve known her. She was an angel in disguise;she was a very strongminded, courageous loving,and caring beautiful person inside and out. So it was a very energy draining, emotional day today for a lot of us.Ok I would like to know if I should continue taking the medication which is Venlafaxine and is it better to take the medication early during the day, because i was taking it late in the afternoon; because i was worried that i would be too sleepy and I would t be able to get through the day. What should I do ? I did not take the medication yesterday; should i still take it tonight now at this time which is 9:00p.m my time. I really want to get some sleep; I can t keep on this way; I need medication to help me sleep; but before I took the medication; my whole system just turned around; because since I couldn t sleep at night; after I drove my little girl to school; I found myself having to severely go back to bed; and it seemed I was able to actually relax and get some sleep; but it still was not a sound sleep; but it was enough sleep to help me cope. Please give me your expert advice. I m very desperate for an anwer to solve this problelm. Believe me it would be very greatly appreciated if you could take the time to help me find a solution.

Through out the first few months working for this company. I had began to noticed that i have a skin disorder called Vitiligo. This has impacted me as i had went into a depression for awhile. I was my own coach and although my father has it i knew it was genetic. Through the years i had seek help for vitiligo, but came to terms that there is nothing else that can be done but wear makeup. However the field i m in is stressful, and there are many demands on workers like myself. Nonetheless i had met someone outside of my work who has a child and since then we now have 2 other boys of which the older and youngest ones have disabilities. The other thing is my preevious employer, i m sure had feeliings for me and was jealous of my spouse. I felt harrassed many times as my employer was personally picking on me. This employer even made up a lie about my spouse which tried to get me into trouble about breaking confientiality. I had felt stressed to go to work. I had expressed my stress/anxiety by gagging before i arrived at work. About a year ago i had went to one of my sons, touraments, where there was lots of people and when he was presented a certificate, i was happy but i had expressed that by gagging 2 or 3 times. I had embarrassed him and my family and myself. That year, had expierence gagging fits @ my sons soccer games, i did not gag at all of them, i had tried to calm myself or even walk away. That did work sometimes. However the interesting thing is, when i had finished my gagging, (it could be 2 or 5 times) i felt relief or a sense normallity. Since then i work indirectly to my previous employer. I know there are some possible stressors. I am forty years old and I have thought about a possible career change. That alone is stressful in itself. But, now after being out of shape and overweight for about a year. I know my health is also taking a toll. I had went to see a naturalpath who prescribed me (ignatia amara 30 ch), i have yet taken them despite knowing the side effects may be horrible. I know this when i went online and it said that when the person feels horrible feeling the medication is working. However , my girlfriend is on medication and she at the beginning felt horrible and the withdrawwals were bad too. However she continues to be on them. Anyway, I still have anxiety, and i still gag. It seems like i get anxiety when there are lots of people around me, i feel a lump in my throat, it feels then that my shirt is too tight or coat. My gagging seems to be impulsive, i sometimes never know when it may happen. My girlfriend is embarrassed when i gag and gets upset with me and will walk away. Sometimes i don t mind because i might vomit. She did say that i need to get help as it is affectiing my home and possible work life. I have even thought about not being here. But, that is not an option, i have too much too loose, my family needs me and i am a role modle. I know that ending my life is no escapegoat and i have the ability to change my life. I have always been a very optimistic person and centered and believed in people. However, sometimes i don t care, and feel angry and alone. I am thinking about seeing my naturalpath again or even my doctor. Any info you can give me will be greatly appreciated.

You havent mentioned anything apart from dreams in the query. Dreams are part of normal sleep but if they are constantly troublesome then it is found that patient has anxiety disorder as well.In such cases anti anxiety drugs are main treatment modality.if there is no associated anxiety at all then you can get an EEG and sleep study. You may also try relaxation exercise and sedative in low dose for some days.

I haven t told my parents anything, so I am not sure if I am suffering from depression or anything else. Five years ago I was sexually harassed by my older brother, and I was so confused I kept it a secret and began to watch adult videos. Since then I had a harder time trusting in people, and I also had one friend at that time use me. Four years later I finally broke down from hiding my feelings and secrets from people, so I ended up telling my friend. She accepted me and I told my other friends, but later on she had problems too and took her anger out on me. She said things like she wanted me dead and cussed me 8ut a lot, so I cried and broke under the pressure. I ve had a hard time believing anything people say, even close friends, and I constantly feel I am a disgusting, horrible, and trashy scum of a person. I have felt that if I were to die no one would be sad and they d be happy, and after I lost a loved one I wished I could switch places with them. I have had suicidal thoughts and whemever I had a lot of anger built up I silenced it by hurting myself, for example digging my nails into my skin. Ontop of all this my mind is now kind of split in two and at some points I am a normal person but then I ll switch to being extremely mad, hateful, suicidal, and depressed. When I became ike this I usually have to hae a friend calm me down. Also, I feel tired all the time, and I never really slept right, I d stayup all night and sleep for maybe a couple hours the next night. My eating habits weren t good either, and sometimes I would throw all of my food away. I feel a lot of the times that I have no happy future and happiness isn t real. I hate myself, and can t trust people. Many nights I had to either shut down my mind or cry until I was tpo emotionally and physically tired. Also, my brother got a girlfriend, and I have thoughts a lot about how I hate that he is happy while I m suffering. I haven t told my parents yet because I don t want to hurt them but I m also scared. I have had dreams of them disowning me and hating me. I ve dealt with all of this since five years ago, and I am a teenager currently. Am I depressed? Do I need to seek help?","Doctor":"DearWe understand your concernsI went through your details.

The symptoms like some one will kill him, suspiciousness, some one is following etc could be occurring due to some underlying psychotic disorder. Paranoid ideation and suspiciousness in a patient of 25-35 yrs age raise suspicion of schizophrenia. Regarding system syndrome you have not mentioned his symptoms in detail but with proper treatment it can be controlled. His symptoms like poor social interaction, fear, not going out etc are probably due to psychosis. Consult a psychiatrist for treatment and evaluation. For weakness due to system syndrome visit a physician.Antipsychotics are mainstay of treatment of schizophrenia. Risperidone, olanzapine etc are used commonly.You can visit India with him for treatment. You can ask me directly if you have more questions regarding his symptoms and treatment.Thanks"},{"Patient":"hi doctor 15 days back i was suffered from motions. nearly i gone 12 times. ifelt very sick. later im not able to recall my past{i didnt 4get every thg but nt able to recall few things eg: i 4get my nephew name, words like interview,SOME NAMES...}. i think in my mind but im not able to speak out.ive undergone for MRA & MRV.

I'm 59.","Doctor":"Hello thanks for asking from HCMHearing voices and noise that wakes up you in night could occur due to a number of reasons. These voices are usually of family member and are persisting. One possible reason is severe anxiety. In severe anxiety individuals may develop hyperarousal. Due to this they may start hearing voices and develop awakening in night. But if the symptoms are recurring and persisting then there may be underlying psychotic phenomenon. These could be hallucinatory voices. Although in elderly it is not common to see hallucinations but still due to some organic lesion such symptoms can be seen.

To start I have had anxiety issues for much of my life. I believe I have some aspects of an anxiety disorder, but I also think there are some physical things going on. Specifically I think I have a food allergy or other issue that leads to my anxiety. My anxiety comes along with no rhyme or reason. Meaning I could do activity A one day with no anxiety and then the next day I could do activity A and have physical anxiety. Same with people. I sometimes have trouble looking my best friends in the eyes. It is really strange. And to keep it all in perspective I am an Army Ranger, I live a normal active lifestyle and have no issues do stressful stuff even in combat. But sometimes I get uncontrollable anxiety. Next, I have notices for the past few years the left side of my face is becoming more and more droopy. my lip and eye. When I am relaxing or fatigued, the whole left side of my face starts to droop. As I fall asleep my left eye and lip close first. I am even noticing it in pictures. Finally I am noticing that along with my physical anxiety, my left eye starts to cross a little and have trouble focusing. Its all really weird. It very well may be a result of anxiety, I just wanted to check. Thanks again four your time.","Doctor":"DearWe understand your concernsI went through your details. I suggest you not to worry much. I can see that you are troubled with generalized anxiety disorder. I suggest you keep yourself busy as well as entertained. We all know, \\"Idle mind is devil's workshop\\". I think you have too much of time to think. Anxiety is fear of something which may or may not be true or may or may not happen in the future. Such a fear is carried by everyone in the world. But everyone do know they have no control over such future events and therefore it is futile to think and worry about them. Secondly, nobody has enough time to think about it. Thirdly everyone are busy living, there is no other alternative except living properly. Start with these simple steps Step 1 - Practice Deep and full breathing whenever possibleStep 2 - Drink plenty of water and fruit juices. Step 3 - A Tomato a day keeps anxiety at bayStep 4 - Exercise regularlyPsychotherapy techniques should suit your requirement.

I went back to work I needed insurance I try hard every day to keep it together but I cant keep my mind from going from one thing to another, I think i m not a good person if I don t do my job perfect I try to keep my attention on one thing then go to the other I cant do it. I blow up at work even thou I try not to I have evil thoughts about the people on my property I m a property manager. I have evil thoughts about the company I work for and the insurance I went to work to get and it still doesn t pay my medical bills because it s mental. I don t think anybody loves me anymore not my family, my husband does sometimes but I cant get my stuff together all I ever wanted in live is to pay my bills people to respect me to have a house of my own and to be somebody. I ve had good jobs and I ve always messed them up one way or the other. I feel like I wasted my entire life no matter how hard I try I never get anywhere in life I m a piece of crap. even when I didn t have a job I was a piece of crap and now I went back to work and im still a piece of crap. I see things I see dead people but they said I was really crazy then and thought I was trying to get my disability so I don t say anything about that anymore I try to ignore it . I see people that aren t here anymore I always have but kept it to myself I didn t want to be thought of as a nut case or different but I do see them they don t bother me but I do get scared at times. I had someone try to pull me out of my bed when I was little my parents told me it was a night mare I know somebody came through the screen door and had my legs pulling me through the bed. but once I said something I stopped talking about it because they said it didn t happen. just like when I worked on the pipeline and had to put up with the some of the men touching me because I wanted to quit but it was good money I never told anybody for seventeen years and when I did I lost my job. but I also was taking metamaphines to loose weight I always had a problem with my weight and was very self conscious of how I looked a friend introduced me to the drug I thought it was okay since a doctor would nt give me diet pills anymore they stopped given them to patients. I was put on them when I was ten years old but I couldn t sleep and they took me off of them until later in my teens my well I want say but she used to beg me to loose weight and I tried so hard to be good I just never was good enough. I did finally loose weight with the help of diet pills and if the doctors would have kept giving them to me then I wouldn t have had to goto the other drugs they said were illegally then I lost my job and I was really a nobody and a fatty. I was called big mama, laird, fatso, u name it when I was growing up all I ever wanted to do was get away and get a job and make a good living on my on and be somebody and I blew that. I ve had other jobs since the pipeline but I never felt it was good enough. Do you think im crazy or do I just feel sorry for myself. I was told once by my cousin when I was younger I never have been little that my parents only wanted one child they wanted to be like my other cousin and have one daughter and I came along and that s why my daddy drank and he and my mama fought and we had to leave home at times cause daddy hit mama or tore the house up cause he was drunk I always thought maybe if I hadn t been born my mama and daddy and sister would have been much happier. I do drink but I don t tell my doctors anymore cause the government said that was why I didn t get my disability but I never wanted a disability check cause I think I can hold a job even though I may have to change jobs more often than I used to cause I blow up, and I just walk out I don t ever want to get fired and be humiliated again I try to stay focus, calm, and do the best I can I don t know what s wrong with me and I don t think any one else does. I almost died a couple of years ago I had a blocked intenstine but I wasn t scared I felt I would go to Heaven even though I know I ve done wrong in my life I ve never hurt anyone in my life if anything I let them take advantage of me by loaning money, the rest was my fault nobody forced me to take the metaphanmien not sure how you spell it I just wanted to do a good job have energy and loose weight. i m problaly just a bad person and it would have been better if I had died when I got real sick I think my life would have been better and I could have helped the people I loved out better I had live insurance and they could have laid me to rest and paid the debits I owed off. Do you think i m crazy I don t know maybe I am but at least I try no matter what my friends have said about me in the past like I changed they didn t know who I was anymore. you see I used to listen to their problems but I never let or talked about mine and when I had no job, and no money than they said they didn t think I was ever he person they thought I was and I didn t understand why they would do that to me like I was a nobody cause I didn t ask them for anything and I tried to work on the side, and anything they ever did for me I paid them back I didn t go crying to them but yet they acted like I was trash and they were still crying and telling me their problems.

Once I saw that I d/c Remeron worried about serotonin symdrome. I am being told her delusions are causing her emotional pain with resulting behaviors more problematic. I will check with pulmonologist to see if Prednisone is going to be an ongoing med for COPD. MY QUESTION: drug/drug interaction with Tramadol: is REMERON safer than CYMBALTA; does one have less potential drug/drug interaction than the other when used in combination with Tramadol?","Doctor":"Hello thanks for asking from HCMI have read the query and I will try to solve it. She has history of Alzheimer's, Depression, Psychosis, COPD and is on Tramadol 50 mg per day, and was given Mirtazepine, Qutiapine for sleep. Now coming to question-- Mirtazepine and Duloxetine both increases serotonin and can interact with Tremadol but as per my opinion mirtazepine should be more safe and should have less interactions with Tremadol.- Both can drugs can be used under controlled condition for depression with tremadol still risk will be there.Thanks, hope this helps you"},{"Patient":"I get dizzy,warm all over and collapse.No shake all over,just white color in face and now face tremors.

All investigations of brain and blood vessels came normal. These symptoms are occurring in episodes. As per my opinion such symptoms could be occurring due to underlying anxiety or panic attacks. In severe anxiety pale face, giddiness and symptoms of hot flashes are seen. Other possibilities are syncope or postural hypotension. In postural hypotension due to sudden shift of blood to periphery individual may suffer symptoms of collapse and giddiness. Get your BP checked in lying down and standing position to rule out hypotension as cause of your symptoms.As the symptoms occur in episode so anxiety is main provisional diagnosis. I would advise you to consult a psychiatrist for evaluation and management. Medicines like Clonazepam, Lorazepam which are short acting benzodiazepines can help to control the symptoms.SSRIs are mainstay of treatment. Consult a psychiatrist for prescription.Thanks"},{"Patient":"yes i am 19 years old and i think i have adhd. i never took it before but i have did illegal drugs. ive never did good in school was never focused an my tenth grade year i never even picked up a pencil. well i got kicked out that year and .. i have the lowest self esteem that anybody can have i find i am very ugly an dont talk bout my problems. i cant ever keep a girlfriend because my trust issues are terrible. i dont have friends because i dont trust people enough to want a friend.. im talking to a girl as of now an she barely ever texts and i always think i do something wrong are like the other night i asked her if she even cares about me are am i to ugly for you... im sick and tired of living this way..

I saw a gyno for the first time who put me on the pill.  It hasn't regulated it yet.  I get it every seven to eight weeks.  The doctor was confused but told me to keep going and if I didn't right itself then he'd try a new one.  Well, I got it on time...But then I missed it and didn't get my period again until seven weeks later.  I then got an ultrasound of my ovaries, as it was suspected I had PCOS.  Results came back that I had only one cyst, which I was told that it is not characteristic of PCOS which usually consists of a bunch of cysts.  But I was told that didn't necessarily mean I don't have it.  My weight is an issue.  I work out 4 to 7 times a week and watch what I eat.  I lost 3 pant sizes yet the weight in my back, face never get smaller, and my arms for some reason seem to get bigger.  I've got facial hair growing like crazy as well as on my chest, inner thighs, and abdomen.  My cystic acne seems to keep getting worse and its leaving scaring.  The hair on my scalp has thinned out some.  My neck, lower back, and ESPECIALLY my left knee has begun to ache in recent months.  It's hard to straighten my leg out after work or after working out.  And once I straighten it for a while, it hurts to bend it again.  I have been clenching my jaw all this year to the point where I get intense headaches starting at my ears and radiating up.  My dentist said my facial muscles were REALLY tight and said it was TMJ.  I'm seeing a psychiatrist because I can't remember the simplest things anymore...like my therapy sessions.  He diagnosed me with depression/anxiety/adhd.  I forget long conversations that had happened moments beforehand.  I turn down random streets and into parking lots and not know why I'm there.  I am in the political field, working for a campaign, so I am required to be a quick, off the cuff communicator, something I used to be good at, but it seems to take a while for me to collect my thoughts.  I'm so frustrated and angry.  I'm incredibly smart, and I know it, but it seems that its hard to show it anymore.  I also can't sleep.  Nothing shuts off in my brain.  And when I do sleep, I wake up, still tired.  Please, someone help and let me know I'm not crazy or paranoid.","Doctor":"DearWe understand your concernsI went through your details. I suggest you not to worry much. The problems you are exaggerating here are actually not problems at all. Because anxiety and stress is the main cause. You do know people searching for their spectacles even when the spectacles are present on their nose. That happens due to anxiety. You are forgetting things because you are anxious. Then it becomes obsession. You want yourself to be watched by yourself. you watch yourself and you forget. You become anxious again and you are obsessive. This cycle continues.You should know that these problems are not mental diseases, but are mental disorders. Many researches and researchers confirm that medicines alone cannot cure mental disorders. Exercise, Life style changes, change in thinking pattern, relaxation etc are as essential as medicines. Psychotherapy can help you changing your lifestyle and thinking patterns.

This is my sheer letter of desperation, and in need of HELP AS SOON AS POSSIBLE!!  - hopefully whoever is reading this will pass this on and keep this letter forward as I need to fight for my dad in some way as he is fighting for his life. Please take the time to read his story, and perhaps someone out there can hear my calling and assist me… Here goes… My father whom is 65 years old, a man of incredible strength , super fit at his age, strong , motivated and helpful in more ways than words can say to others, had fallen seriously ill !!! My mother passed away from cancer suddenly in 2 weeks being in hospital they also found out the cancer too late, she died on the 24 April 2008. We all went thru bad depression, but all have recovered... so first thing before anyone diagnoses my dad’s problem related to my mom’s passing is wrong. That I can promise you. So on to getting to the bottom of my father’s terrible road … of illness My dad started to show signs of shortness of breath , and he seemed to be using a lot of his neck muscles to do the work,  from being a super fit martial artist , to being short of breathe on walking distances became odd.  He complained about being so tired all the time, he just could not sleep enough even though he was sleeping regularly and often in the day too. his appetite started to subside  from being a very big eater  loving his red meats , to having lost cravings for any such  food , and at times skipped many meals , and over the past few months had been losing weight ,  of course to some extent being alone since my mother past had a bit of an effect ,  however all of us children sent him to three different GP doctors and he had blood tests done and apparently all was fine. They informed him it was possibly anxiety and stress, depression, and put him on anti – depressants, of which made him even more tired,  so he would take them occasionally but did not finish his course.. Also in beginning he would lose a bit of his voice and try clear it when he spoke ,  doctors thought it was reflux , ulcers and heartburn , prescribed nexiam , He always complained about his tummy, his stomach gave him a lot of problems first would be constipated and then it would be diarrhea, he kept on saying it felt like a blockage of some sort... but continues with some laxitives. He went back to the doctors a few times complaining he was not getting better , they kept giving him vitamin b injections and prescribing more meds … He then tried a natural route of which I suggested, he spoke to a holistic doctor and gave him a good few different natural anti biotic etc... After a few weeks he felt a little better, but still not well, he just seemed to be getting worse. Back at doctors and said he had high blood pressure, he had days when he was dizzy and bad headaches, and his muscles cramped a lot. Those where all his symptoms … Now after my mother passed he moved up to the lodge (farm ) where he was quite far away from us in the city and drove frequently up to see some clients of what he had left , he lost much work due to his health . On this particular day , he was not well he stayed over at my brothers house and eventually could not sleep nicely through the night , he had to sit in a chair as it felt like he could not breathe he said it felt like his stomach was causing much discomfort and could not breath when laying down . He was very stubborn too and does not like doctors and has never been to doctor or hospitals in his life as he has been super healthy all his life. His biggest fear was hospitals. On the 14 JULY 2010 After much convincing and him finally agreeing he was seriously ill, we took him to hospital where they did x rays and put him on a drip in casualty, upon awaiting results etc … his blood pressure dropped to a severe low that they had to have him elevated as to not incur and brain damage and loss of blood to the brain, they gave him adrenaline and volvuven to stabiles blood pressure and he then went in to respiratory arrest. Because my father does not have medical aid and we were at a private hospital casualty, we had to call on Johannesburg general hospital known as charlotte maxeke hospital. And try getting a bed in the ICU ward over there. Thank goodness he was accepted, but he has to be intubated in the mean time at the casualty, with a pipe in his throat.  And he was unconscious, the doctors consulted and said he was unable to be transported to the government hospital as one he was unstable to be and secondly we were awaiting a bed for him at the hospital. The doctors had informed us on my father’s state and told us that it was between GOD and the Medicine and that was the hope we got... The following day my father opened his eyes and was awake, the government hospital had a bed ready for him. He was transported to the hospital, and was admitted in the ICU ward there. They had mentioned he had pneumonia in both lungs etc, they treated him and within a week he went from being intubated and respiratory arrest to being discharged into a respiratory ward for two days, and then discharged on 22 July 2010 with some anti biotic to take home and scheduled further follow ups to be conducted thereafter.  However on the 23rd July just the next day he was not feeling too good again, we got a ICU nurse to stay with him and we monitored him, but he was not coping and started breaking into a sweat, eventually we took him back to hospital however they would not take him back straight away and we had to go through the casualty which was terrible, the attending doc on that night was terrible, left my dad, and we had to queue.. Instead of prioritizing patients... my dad was given oxygen mask, however starting to sweat even more and becam lymph and passing out battling to remain conscious... I begged and pleased and my brother too tried to speak to the doctor whom did not want to help , eventually one of the male nurses and practicing doctor a young man helped me , and said we need to intubate your father , at that point I had to help assist in the recuss room , and the again the main doctor on duty simply did not lift a hand to help… although the young man was not completely well trained , he managed to sort my father out and  eventually a lady doctor from respiratory ward whom knew my father’s case  had assisted and reprimanded the on duty doctor for his  lack of assistance.. Finally dad was intubated and stabilized; he had to stay in an open room in casualty stable until; a bed was available in the ICU ward. And was admitted in the ICU ward on the 24 July 2010 for the second time. Till Today he is still in that same place … he has had many doctors and professors and academics’ from that hospital have a look at him, they have done ct scans, Mir’s and have been told they have done every test that they can, I have asked and requested a list of the tests done and the results, and awaiting this.  We have been reassured these are all the good  best doctors and the professor is apparently well known and the “guru”… sadly that my father’s case seems to be one of a rare kind and the cannot  get a definitive diagnoses for my father  , he has had a cervical fusion done to release compression that was on nerves ,  he has had a tracheostromy  and is on a ventilator , they have suspected it be “MYSTHENIA GRAVIS” ,  and have been treating him for this , he has lost so much weight , during all this he has incurred episodes of respiratory failure again as they try wean him off ventilator and then  the co 2 levels  go up so much that he has also been in a comatose state , for two days , and he has severe up and down days ,,. Some days he looks like he responding well to the medication, and some days looks terrible, there has been so many tests and most of them have been clear and negative to anything …. So the closest is the myasthenia gravis of what I am told. They do physic on him every day I am told and that they try sit him in the chair but some days he is too ill to do so but they say it is mandatory to his improvement and progress; they also have him on plasma dialysis. During the time he has been in hospital  he has incurred a bedsore of which first operated on in theatre , proper post maintenance was not done and the bed sore got worse , so more debridement had to be done. Again they had to take him to theatre to debraid and cut the bed sore which is situated just above his bum towards the lower back.   Just before the op, he had lost so much blood from the bed sore they had to give him 23 units of blood. At this point his bed sore is not as painful as it was, however now he has diarrhea that has been for 6 days now, when it began they even put a catheter in his bum coz it was so uncontrolled, dad has not eaten in a very long time and has a feed tube in. he drinks lots of fluids. At this point however helpful doctors have been whether comforting or not... this is about my father and he is fighting he is not giving up, he says he wants to get better and as he is fighting... I am fighting here for him too, I NEED SOMEONE TO HELP!! SOMETHING, GOD TO BLESS THE DOCTORS WITH MORE IDEAS AND SUGGESTIONS ON WHAT COULD BE WRONG WITH DAD, ,  no more tests have been scheduled as far as I know , says the one doctor , so now what ?? They cannot say if dad will live or die, get better or get worse they do not know… it may not be their fault, but I think somewhere out there in the world will help me in my desperation!!!! I am not giving up!!!! And I will not rest until I get an answer!!! I would rather know what is wrong with my father, either they fix it or our family can prepare for the worse … but not to know!!! Is not fair!!! … If they can find out how a person died in an autopsy... how can they not know when a person is alive!!!????? In this day of technology!!! PLEASE SOMEONE ANYONE!!!! MY FATHER AND OUR FAMILY DO NOT HAVE THE FUNDS TO GO TO A PRIVATE HOSPITAL OR INCURR ANY OTHER COSTS. ALREADY THE COSTS FROM THE GOVERNMENT HOSPITAL IS STARTING TO ESCALATE AT A HUGE PACE.

However, as there is altered sense of smell- its better you rule out organicity by getting a brain scan (also as there is no response to resperidone). Till you get the scan your doctor can either raise the dose of respseridone or shift you to a new one- like: olanzapine etc. Alongwith these changes: the dose of mirtazapine is hiked inorder to get control over depressive symptoms.Talk to your doctor about the above mentioned points and proceed further.wish you good luck and speedy recovery.Dr. Manisha GopalMD Neuropsychiatry"},{"Patient":"Hi, I dont exactly know how to explain what has been happening to me but I will try  my best.

The symptoms you have described like dryness of mouth, palpitations (racing heart), chocking of voice, twitches on face etc are due to anxiety only. Combined approach using medicines and behavioural methods prove most useful in social phobia. Commonly SSRIs are used in treatment. You have been already prescribed Escitalopram for that and this is right drug for social anxiety. Melzap or clonazepam is a benzodiapine drug and the drug should be taken on sos basis only. The drug helps to reduce the symptoms of anxiety. Other drugs like Propranolol are used specifically for special events like before presentation or in group discussions. The drug help to reduce acute anxiety symptoms like palpitations, sweating, tremors and increase confidence of individual. For this drug you can discuss with your psychiatrist.Over all escitalopram and clonazepam are safe to use and are not associated with serious side effect. Escitalopram may cause nausea, diarrhoea, dizziness as side effects. On long term use in high doses it may cause delayed ejaculation or anorgasmia as side effects, but these side effects are reversible on dose discontinuation. Clonazepam at 0.25 mg doses is relatively free of side effects except sedation. The drug has abuse potential so don't take this drug for long time.Thanks, hope this helps you."},{"Patient":"HI..

You feel better when you are alone. In a number of patients of depression even on treatment some residual symptoms remain. I would advise you to take help from a psychologist. Cognitive therapy can help you in overcoming crying spells. Some medicines when used a augmentation agents along with conventional antidepressants help to remove residual symptoms. Medicines like bupropion, lamotrigine, Buspirone etc can be used. Consult your psychiatrist for details of treatment and prescription.Apart from this exercise daily, practice yoga to keep yourself relaxed, this will help in increasing confidence. Start taking vitamin B12 supplements. Deficiency of vitamin B 12 is common finding in depression. Supplements containing omega 3 fatty acids also potentiate the action of antidepressants.Diets rich in protein and carbohydrates and poor in fat result in early improvement.Hope this helps youThanks"},{"Patient":"I believe I have adult ADD or ADHD.

Since you have followed strict schedule still have complaints then it need further evaluation.ADHD can present with similar symptoms but symptoms of hyperactivity and impulsivity should also be there to make diagnosis of ADHD. Secondly symptoms usually result in significant dysfunction since childhood. Such symptoms could occur in mild depression also. Lack of focus, tiredness, poor concentration etc are commonly seen.

Now i know that may be weird to ask but I need to know if a have anxiety disorder or something because of my past and how do I stop being the way I am.I want to start by saying I have had a hard childhood. The asian culture I grew up in was very demanding so I feel as if now that I'm on my own living and supporting myself without my parents completely...the things i experience are because of my past and i just am not consciously aware of it. My parents never told me they were proud of me and I was always not the best...I was never good enough for my parents even though in reality I was above average in school all the time. The past four years have been difficult and i have just recently moved out two months ago. My parents and I were able to try to mend things together and I got close and dependent on my parents and then they got mad and left me over and over...they never stayed the same. WHat I mean by leaving me...I mean disowning me...stop talking to me...etc. I'm in a wonderful relationship with a guy I will probably marry in the future. I want everything to be well, but I have concerns. My boyfriend is wonderful, but I get scared for no reason that I'm going to lose him. Sometimes because I'm afraid he will find someone better. I'm so insecure and I don't have any reason to be and I know that i don't have reasons to be but i am and I don't know why. In addition, I feel so sad and sometimes mad- but more sad- when things don't go as planned. Its almost like I am so uptight and stiff and not flexible like I know I am. I want to know why I act like this. I get periods of sadness as well even when I have no reason to be. I'm really happy out of my parents' house. But i have the concerns I have listed above.  Also...if this is all because of my past, how do I let go of the past? How do I stop my mind from thinking too much negatively?thanks","Doctor":"DearWe understand your concernsI went through your details. I suggest you not to worry much.

Having done so since I was around 5-6 I now have a ready supply of thick skin all over my hands and feet. I also compulsively eat my lips. It seems to be prompted by a variety of things. First and foremost is hunger, then comes anxiety, boredom, stress and finally loneliness.

I m 24 now and haven t experienced any side effects apart from the gradual sharpening of my teeth.

Sometimes it is accompanied with a burning sensation, though very mild and non debilitating. I am being treated for moderate anxiety and panic attacks with Lexapro 10mg, and Xanax .25 as needed. I have been on the meds for about 2 months now. My overall mood and anxiety has gotten better but I still have these symptoms. I thought the symptoms were from the anxiety and stress but im not sure now if this is a side effect of the meds or something else, or if it just takes more time? Sometimes it feels like my arm or leg  (mainly left side) circulation is mildly being cut off, like they are swollen but there is nothing evident. I saw a neurologist and after a physical exam  ( no MRI or CT scans ), he could not find anything other than possible anxiety. I should mention that I take Xalatan drops for my eye pressure.

You have fear about getting Herpes simplex. Your parents are not able to notice any bump but still you have strong belief that there is something wrong. You have to check lips and oral cavity again and again. Some times you have fear of cranker sores. As most of the times you have fear of herpes while no one noticed anything serious, so most likely the symptoms are due to health anxiety or hypochondriasis. In patients of hypochondriasis serious anxiety occurs because of fear of illness. Some times delusional ideas occur for some illness.Consult a psychiatrist for evaluation and management. In most cases antidepressants prove useful. Commonly SSRIs like fluoxetine or Paroxetine are used. If the problem persists then low dose antipsychotic drugs are used.Thanks, visit a psychiatrist for diagnosis."},{"Patient":"yes Iam 48years old have gone through menopause about 3 half years ago I know I don t get the hot but feel maybe I suffer from the moods but possibly stress causing this my hubby calls me sensitive lol.

The reason behind these symptoms is loss of hormonal levels. Your symptoms like mood swings, lack of motivation, tiredness, lack of energy, stress, sensitiveness etc are possibly due to menopausal syndrome only. Hormonal drugs were prescribed but you stopped them because of fear of gaining weight. A lot of other medicines prove useful in post menopausal mood swings.

I suggest you not to worry much.  I being a psychologist, can suggest that such pains for health anxiety disorder cases are normal and so many people do have.This is due to so many factors. one common factor is obsession. You had that disturbing sensation once. You expected it to happen again and tried. Then you started experiencing it as you were expecting it. Then your body brought the familiar symptom because you are expecting it. Then you started worrying that the symptom is coming again and again and expect it. Body brings it again as you are expecting it. You become worried and so on. That is obsession in simple terms. Ignore it and the problem vanishes. Psychotherapy techniques should suit your requirement. If you require more of my help in this aspect, Please post a direct question to me in this URL.

But be rest assured. You will be getting rid of all these  in a short span of time. The symptoms you manifest are the classic symptoms of some depression. We, the human beings are  basically animals with a social orientation.i.e social animals. We need someone to share. In your case upteenth time, could not find someone to share with. For your knowledge, I wish to narrow down your issues in a different perspective. Let me show you  four persons within you. The dynamcis of these persons are measured with your interaction with your society and the society starts from your family itself. The first person within you is the \\"person known to you and your society- i.ie both the society and yourself are aware of you. This is your free area and you can interact with the society well in this area. The second person is the \\"One   who is known to society only and you are unaware  about this person. To be precise, it is what society thinks of you and you are not aware. You need to interact with the society well to know what the society thinks of you. The third person is the hidden personality within you. It is the person within you and not known to the society. That means there is a hidden aspect of you which is not known to the society. This is the only aspect which hinders you in your further advancement towards a fuller life. The fourth person is the one about whom neither you nor your society are aware of. The fourth one being the person not known to you and the society. The first area if you widen as much as possible you will be shifting yourself from ILLNESS to WELLNESS.  The more you are with the society, more are the chances of your recovery. Find a person with whom you can confide everything. In case, you don't find, check for the psychologist available in town.You can consult a psychologist for a personality assessment an emotional release to deal with the other three areas. The balancing of the brain chemistry can be taken care of by a psychiatrist with a short duration medication.

That is only a few of the examples, though. Is this normal? Like my subconcious? Or is it something else? I ve just been wondering.","Doctor":"HelloThanks for asking from HCMYou have mentioned that there is something in your head. You are aware of her existence. You can converse with her and she gives you advise. She sometimes tells you for your boyfriend. First of all would like to tell you that such type of subconscious things never exist. If you are hearing her voices or seeing her then most likely you are having hallucinations. Most likely you have beliefs about her existence and that points towards delusions. Delusions are false unshakable beliefs held firmly in mind. I would like to advise you to consult a Psychiatrist. With time this thing will start affecting your life and you will suffer badly. Medicines like antipsychotics are commonly used for such symptoms. Olanzapine, Qutiapine, Risperidone etc are common drugs used. If no improvement is seen then for resistant symptoms Clozapine is prescribed. Consult a Psychiatrist for detailed evaluation.Thanks"},{"Patient":"I have had the feeling of being winded or bruise in my breast bone area & about the same area on my back.

You have normal ECG and you are a known case of panic disorder so most likely the reason of epigastric distress is anxiety.Zoloft is a good Antianxiety drug and it can control anxiety. For acute symptoms like you are having medicines like low dose benzodiazepines as Etizolam, Oxazepam can be used. Consult your psychiatrist for the medicines.I would advise you to reduce caffeine intake. Caffeine and tea increase the risk of anxiety and symptoms like epigastric distress.

Other possibility is irritable bowel syndrome. Both are psychiatric disorders which are characterised by preoccupation with abdominal complaints. In hypochondriasis individuals have anxiety about getting some serious illness. While in IBS they have multiple complaints related to stomach like alternating constipation or diarrhoea. Consult your psychiatrist for proper treatment.Medicines like levosulpiride, amisulpiride etc have good results in such symptoms. Only in some individuals medicines like SSRIs are needed.

I would say it has been worsening the past week, its causing me to fall out with my friends as i find myself continuously snapping at them when really they havent done anything wrong. Thanks.","Doctor":"Hello, Welcome to Health Care MagicYou always had issues of anger but recently the problem has aggravated. You have issues with friends and causing loss of social relations. Little things make you frustrated. Such symptoms should not be overlooked. These can occur due to impulse control disorder, in which sudden anger outbursts are seen, harm to others or self harm is commonly seen. Other possibility is atypical depression which can present with symptoms of increased anger. I would advise you to consult a psychiatrist for expert opinion. Some times low doses of antidepressant drugs help in recovery. Fluoxetine is specifically used to control anger in atypical depression. If anger is due to poor impulse control then mood stabilisers are needed for treatment. Sodium valproate is used to control anger outbursts.You can attend anger management sessions with consultation of a psychiatrist.thanks"},{"Patient":"hello, my name is jeremy and i am in need of medical assistance/ advice My wife and i believe i may be suffering from one or more of the following: actively attacks/ disorder Severe depression bipolar disorder *i have horrible mood swings Frequent panic attacks (and or) panic disorder to try and sum up my prolbems *its to the point were i feel that im always on the edge of my seat....

Recently you have been diagnosed with chronic fatigue syndrome. Conventional anti-depressant didn't work. Adderall is used by some psychiatrist for improving symptoms of CFS but the response is subjective.

Medicines like Duloxetine, Milnacipran etc can give you good results. Both are SNRI drugs and have nice effects in depression associated pain and in CFS. For other symptoms of pain medicines like NSAIDs can be used.

I was diagnosed about a year ago, and take 100 mg Zoloft. About 4 days ago, I had what I believe to be my first panic attack. I had ingested quite a bit of caffeine on this day, so I m guessing this is what triggered it. It was pretty scary, and lasted about an hour. Chills, discomfort in chest, tingling and numbness and this awful feeling of dread. Ever since then, I ve been experiencing what I can only describe as a lightness in my chest that goes down into my arms at times. When this happens, I feel like I m about to experience another attack, but I am able to calm myself down before it happens. I have no symptoms other than this, and no pain, but it still makes me feel uncomfortable. I would like to see a cardiologist, but unfortunately I have no insurance at the moment. Is this normal or is this something I should be concerned about?","Doctor":"Hello, Welcome to Health Care MagicYou have mild depression and anxiety and are prescribed Sertraline for that. The drug is used in anxiety, depression and also in panic attacks. It can improve the condition but in states of severe panic attacks other drugs like low dose benzodiazepines as clonazepam, alprazolam etc are needed. You had caffeine triggered panic attack and then you have fear of future panic attacks. Such fear and anxiety for panic attacks is also called as Anticipatory Anxiety. Such type of anxiety is common after panic attacks. Most likely there is no need to consult a cardiologist. Visit your psychiatrist again and ask about addition of some medicines like clonazepam that can be used in panic attacks.Try relaxation exercises, breathing exercises to decrease symptoms of arousal in anxiety. Biofeedback by a psychologist will also help you.Thanks, hope this helps you."},{"Patient":"I have small, pale dots ( not raised bumps) on my penis head and shaft.

I been under care of an Rheumatologist since . I have seen an Psychiatrist for 8 month, has me on 2 depression pills Britellix and Mirazepam, My depression is not the real problem , my problem is more of the anxiety. He prescribed lorazepam .05 mg one at night and 1 for daytime . I told him it does nothing for my constant anxiety, I get so nervous and so very scared all the time.

I was diagnosed with ADHD about 5 or 6 years ago. I took Concerta (54 mg) just about the entire time. Recently (last few weeks) my doctor changed to Methylin (20 mg/day) because insurance was giving us problems with Concerta. The Methylin really did not do anything for me. I saw my primary care physician in December, and discussed this. I told her side effects from the Concerta (cannot sleep, no appetite, mood swings, etc. common from what I have read about Concerta). She then wanted me to try 20 mg of Methylin in the morning, 10 mg in the evening because of the long days I need to be focused in law school. Anyway, getting to the point of my question (I wanted to provide background the best I could). Since I have switched, I have actually found the new medicine to work. It is not as, umm not sure how else to put this but, punch you in the face, like Concerta can be. It is more even throughout the dosage. BUT, I have been having terrible, terrible headaches since I have been taking it. On the bottle, it says that is a side effect. I am wondering if this is a normal side effect. If this is normal, is there anyway to stop it aside from taking Tylenol, Advil, etc.? They usually do not even touch it. I take 2 rapid release Tylenol, and another about an hour later because it is still killing me. Should I see a doctor or is this completely normal?","Doctor":"DearWe understand your concernsI went through your details. I suggest you not to worry much.

So is there any medication i can take to make it go away? please please answer me :(","Doctor":"Hello, Welcome to Health Care MagicFrom the history you have written I can say that most likely you are suffering from anxiety disorder only and it is not due to autism. Autism is a different disorder.The symptoms like feeling sick, fear of going out of home, excessive worries about future, fear of eating more etc are due to anxiety only. You have anxiety of going out with friends and you stay at home only, most likely agoraphobia is also associated.I would advise you to consult a Psychiatrist for expert opinion. Medicines like selective serotonin re uptake inhibitors as fluoxetine, Sertraline are very effective. Some drugs as propranolol help in decreasing symptoms of anxiety in certain situations like moving out of home. Behavior therapy with relaxation exercises, breathing exercises is also useful.Thanks, hope this helps you"},{"Patient":"hi, my father had cancer n we had the treatment from cmh rawalpindi.there was a mass on the right side of his neck and that was removed by operation, later he had chemotherapy buthe couldnot take much food. so he started some hakeem s medicine which probably had alot of steroids in it and now he ha started forgetting things alot. he always feels sleepy too. what do you recommend now?","Doctor":"He needs methylcobalamine injection.

The main clinical features are declining memory and features of Parkinson's disease like tremors and a number of other symptoms.

He is acting stranger, have problems of aggression, don't listen any one and has started taking alcohol. He is not remembering the episode of aggression. Such symptoms may occur some time following head trauma because of injury to frontal and temporal lobe of brain. Injury to brain may cause personality changes and may aggravate anti-social behaviour. Loss of short term memory might be due to trauma only. I would advise you to consult a good Psychiatrist for his treatment. To decrease his aggression and post traumatic complications medicines like Mood Stabilisers like Sodium Valproate, Carbamazepine etc can be used.

Its has potential to cause sedation and drowsiness. She is also taking Codeine which is an opioid drug. Use of both drugs together results in intense effects and a lot of individuals abuse the drugs together. Cyclizine increases the effect of Codeine. So abrupt stoppage of the drug has not only resulted in withdrawal of cyclizine but it has also resulted in side effects due to decreased effects of codeine. This is the reason of hallucinations she is having. She has intense anxiety which is due to withdrawal effects.Consult a psychiatrist for expert opinion. Ask her to not to drive for few days.Thanks"},{"Patient":"SIR I am very dipressed & scared ,facing anxiety coz in 31st dec i had an accident by slipping condom of my boyfreind & there were might some sperm on my upper vagina ...i took I-pill after half an hour.....but from nd day i had high dipression , stress , tension , tauma ,anxiety & acidity ...and from next week i faced common cold , very mild fever & very mild throat pain.......plz tell me what problem i have ?","Doctor":"Hello You had accidental unprotected intercourse and took ipill after that. You have developed severe anxiety, stress, tension, depressive symptoms and other multiple somatic complaints. Most likely you have developed anxiety disorder after that. Some times some distressing event precipitates such complaints. I would request you to consult a Psychiatrist for that. Medicinal and non-medicinal treatment both are available.

You want to kill yourself. Most probably your complaints are due to some personality problem. Other possibility is Impulse control disorder. Severe anger spells are seen in both disorders. Antisocial personality, Narcissistic personality etc disorders may present with revengeful attitude. Consult a good psychiatrist for treatment, don't feel bad about yourself. Mood stabilisers like Sodium Valproate, Carbamazepine etc drugs can be used to control anger outbursts and to stabilise the mood of patients.

He is also talking to self or muttering most probably. He has tendencies to harm self or others and is short tempered. As per my opinion these symptoms should not be overlooked and need proper consultation of psychiatrist. Such type of symptoms can occur due to some psychotic episode. Even early stages of schizophrenia can be one possibility. There is urgent need for treatment.Treatment in form of antipsychotics like Olanzapine, Haloperidon, Risperidone, Qutiapine etc is needed in psychosis. Proper family support to patient is necessary for better results.Thanks, hope this helps you"},{"Patient":"Hi, My name is Alexanda and I am 23 years old.

You are suppose to refer to concentration and attention as two. Attention span for any adult is maximum 30 minutes. Sometimes, a person can be attentive to an interesting thing for more than 30 minutes, such as movies or games. Concentration is attention plus understanding. For this too, span of below 30 minutes. If you are able to make your studies interesting and based on variable principle, your concentration level can be increased. Concentration comes only when you are interested in what you do. So please be passionate towards what you are doing or do only those things which you are interested in. It is also possible to improve your concentration level with the help of yoga, meditation and breathing exercises.Psychotherapy techniques should suit your requirement.

The drug is a good sedative and hypnotic. It is a brain depressant. Use of this drug for long periods and then abrupt stoppage can cause lowering of seizure threshold and can precipitate seizure in susceptible persons. You have taken the drug even more than it was prescribed and then abruptly stopped, this is the reason of precipitation of seizures. So to prevent seizures of withdrawal drug doses should be tapered gradually. Dose should be decreased about 10% every week and to be stopped taking after about 6-8 weeks.

My question is how can I help myself through the withdrawal symptoms with out taking more drugs?","Doctor":"Hello Pristiq is Desvenlafaxine. This is a SNRI group of anti-depressant drug. The drug acts by increasing serotonin and nor-epinephrin neurotransmission in brain. It cause changes at molecular level so abrupt stoppage of use result in rebound effects and consequent withdrawal syndrome. Though the withdrawal doesn't result in serious complications still it can prove distressing. Consult a Psychiatrist for help in withdrawal and how to taper drug. Normally one should decrease dose at about 25% every 4 weeks and in 8-12 weeks medicine can be stopped completely. But that too depends upon the initial dose of drug. To prevent withdrawal symptoms without drug I would advise you to take plenty of water, take diets rich in protein and carbohydrates. Avoid alcohol or any other recreational drug. Consult a psychiatrist if problem persist.Thanks"},{"Patient":"Hi my name is Pamela and I am writing about my son Darryl who is 16 years. In 7th grade he started sweating excessively.

Hyperthyroid state is one of main reason for increased sweating. Hyperthyroidism also increases anxiety attacks and can cause severe anxiety. Severe anxiety might be the reason for his anti-social behaviour. Try to talk to him and ascertain his concern. Take him to a psychiatrist for detailed evaluation and if thyroid levels come in higher range then also consult a physician for anti-thyroid medicines. Medicines like Propranolol, Nodalol are very useful to control anxiety symptoms, hyperhydrosis and these medicines are also used in dysfunctional thyroid.Thanks hope this helps you"},{"Patient":"I m 23 yrs old guy. I m facing a really bizarre problem.

The things get worse when boys too show me the same behavior like putting hand on neck or by any means they just try either not to make eye contact with me or just they end the conversation with me.

This social phobia is increasing day by day. I am scared to talk to anyone. I cant even tell my problem to anyone becoz they would make fun of me or just say its not a problem at all. But, please help ........I need it......","Doctor":"Hello You have problem that you always tries to look into the eyes while having a conversation. You feel that people are thinking that you are looking at their breasts. Even with family members you have such problem and this thing is causing loss of confidence. Most probably your complaints are occurring due to Social anxiety disorder and this has reached to obsessional level. You have started thinking that you should not look into the breasts and due to this you continuously look in individuals eyes. You becomes conscious due to that and this has resulted in social impairment. I would advise you to consult a Psychiatrist for that. Behavior therapy will help in decreasing the undesired behaviour. Medicines like hight dose escitalopram, paroxetine, fluoxetine etc are commonly used to decrease anxiety. For symptomatic relief low dose benzodiazepines or propranolol can be used.

The habit of nose picking has been taken care of by ENT doctor. He has habit of spitting in house all the times. Most likely the habit of spitting is related to Alzheimers disease. Underlying anxiety and forgetfulness may be the reason for his repeated spitting. Probably he is not aware of repeated spitting. To minimise the habit-- Keep one pen and paper pad near him. Write down instructions on the paper in front of him. In this way the number of spitting will reduce to some extent. - Other possible reason for the increased salivation might be the medicines for Alzheimers disease.

Or is this typical of hypnagogic hallucinations?","Doctor":"Hello Hypnogogic hallucinations are the hallucinations seen while individual is going to sleep. The symptoms you are having are sudden jerky movements, shouting and screaming from sleep. Most likely these symptoms are not occurring due to hallucinations. Sudden jerky movements during sleep along with scream can occur in rapid eye movement sleep. Hypnic jerks are commonly observed in sleep which can be associated with night mares and can cause intense scream. Other possible reason is myoclonic jerks. These are sudden jerky movements of muscles seen in sleep due to disturbed electrical activity in brain. As the condition is causing impairment in functioning I would advise you to consult a Neuropsychiatrist or sleep specialist for expert opinion. Sleep studies or EEG are done to know exact localisation of jerks. In some individuals even short term use of low dose benzodiazepines like Alprazolam, Lorazepam help in improving the condition.Thanks, hope this helps you"},{"Patient":"I always feel horrible from the time i wake up till i sleep and its ruining everything in my life my friends, family and school. when I get to school I feel so horrible that I cant focus and when I get home and I try to do my homework I just stare at my book for hours...

In middle aged females mainly in 40-50 years of age pre menopausal syndrome may be the main reason of such symptoms. Females suffer night sweats, hot flushes, mood swings, low mood, crying spells. These symptoms occur due to change in hormonal levels in a female of menopausal age.

It has become very difficult to control her. We can hardly satisfy what she wants. She always blames me of ruining her life which is not at all true. This is not a new problem. I have seen her doing all these from my very childhood. Any help would be appreciated","Doctor":"Dear brother,The phenomenon of displaying these sorts of mood swings and blaming you for the loneliness and sufferings are the classic symptoms of \\"SIBLING RIVALRY\\" which is emanating from her inner mind.As a matter of fact, the elder offspring gets a sort of insecurity feeling, when the second one is taken birth since all attention is diverted towards the new born which is beyond the comprehension of the first born. In this context, the child(your sister) construed that  she was being avoided by her parents on your arrival, which hurts her in her inner mind.The inner mind of the first child is not so developed at that stage and is not  expected to reason or rationalize the core fact.This could have been avoided, had her been given enough attention, care and a reassurance of the unconditional love of her parents in the midst of all your birth and growth. Unknowingly, she displaces her anger towards you which was originally towards the innocent parents.The elder sister, all through her growth compares the love, care, attention, things, events etc which you enjoy that of her and confirms her conviction in her  innerworld. These are all the unconscious process started from her childhood since your birth. The lingering thoughts emanated from the harboured emotions are the  causes mood swings. Whatever happened has happened. Need not worry. Everything will become alright. Take her to a Psychologist for intervention and for the mood swings, a Psychiatrist can effectively prescribe some medication for a short duration. The psychological counselling and the unconditional family support will invariably help her mind to come in terms with the reality and she can lead a peaceful life.In case you need any further clarification, please do check if you can contact me directly.

You can ejaculate but feel no orgasm. You have been on psychiatric medicines also. See a number of medicines used in psychiatry can cause decrease in libido and can result in anorgasmia. Persisting complaints result in dysfunction in family and which further aggravate the problem. A vicious cycle is formed in which individual loses self confidence. Commonly used medicines like Sildenafil, Tadalafil etc help to improve erection but these medicines don't improve libido. I would advise you to increase your diet with fenugreek seeds.
