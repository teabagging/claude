Cerebral hypoxia due low oxygen penetration into the brain as a result of anemia. You could be having the headache not as a result of anemia but as a result of another illness. Antimigraine medication will be of use here ( acetaminophen, ibuprofen etc) to alleviate the headache. For the anemia, the treatment/cure will depend on the cause of it i.e iron deficiency, vitamin b deficiency, folic acid deficiency, hemorrhage/bleeding, renal failure, septicemia, cardiac diseases, HIV infection, liver diseases etc. Your doctor needs to identify the cause of the anemia and treat/cure, then you will stop shorting blood (anemic) and with the associated supplementation of iron pills or blood transfusion depending on the degree of anemia, you will recover fast enough. So I will suggest you head to your doctor right away for a complete blood work to identify infection, liver and kidney functions/infection, malaria etc. If there is a notion of trauma or hemorrhage the doctor will do tests depending on your carefully taken medical history.

Firstly, you do not need to increase the monocyte count. Basically we find Monocyte as 1-3%. So, usually the level is very low.

Briefly,the high eosinophilia could be caused by intestinal worms infestation /allergy to helminthic toxins released by worms/pulmonary/tropical eosinophilia. Due to availability of reports only and no clinical examination courtesy the internet ,the doctors scope is left to D/D or Differential Diagnosis. The eosinophilia in Coastal areas ,in addition to worms could be also due to Filariasis ,the vector spreading the same is mosquito. Meanwhile a Stool microscopy to confirm the presence of Ova and Cysts of Worms and a Midnight Blood Sample for confirming Microfilaria can be done in a recognised Lab. The treatment can be started with Tab Albendazole(Combatrin-A or Zentel) 400 mg at night for 01 day followed by T.Hetrazan (Di Ethyl carbamazine)50 mg PO once -Day 01st day T.Hetrazan 50 mg 02 nd Day and 2  TID/100mg thrice daily for 04 to 14  days and then repeat the  Eosinophil count. The allergic symptomatic treatment can be given with Levo-Cetzine/Cetzine-05 mg BID.

In this disease the normal biconcave shape of RBC is changed into Sickle shape due to mutation in the gene responsible for  hemoglobin synthesis. it leads to obstruction of microcirculation and hemolytic anemia. Now, there is 2 conditions related to this disease. One is homozygous state where patient has total inability to form normal hemoglobin and a heterozygous state where patient has mild inability to form normal Hemoglobin. Transmission of this disease depends on both the parents. If one is homozygous and other is normal then chance of the baby to have the disease  is 100%.

If you are a female patient and you have heavy menstrual bleeding, that is a possible cause. I you are older than 50, you should have a colonoscopy to be sure you are not loosing blood in your stools. Reflux by itself is not a cause of low serum iron.

If it is an immune cause, steroids are one of the options available (omnacortil is a steroid treatment). There are other options and these also depend on the platelet count.

AT present I am in west coast Canada.","Doctor":"Hi The legs have two sets of veins, deep veins and superficial veins (close under the skin), blood goes from the superficial to the deep veins. Clots usually form in the deep veins though they can occur in the superficial veins as well. Whereas the arteries in our bodies have thin muscle our veins do not and they rely on the contractions of the surrounding muscles to return the blood to the heart. Some persons with a history of DVT can have a complication called post thrombotic syndrome where the clot resulted in damage to the valves or veins.Some of the symptoms of this include: swelling of the leg due to a build up of fluid, varicose veins, heaviness, itching or tingling, discoloration. Initial treatments include leg elevation and the use of compression stocking, in some cases medication can be used. You should speak to your doctor so he or she can assess the swelling and initiate appropriate treatment i hope this helpful to you"},{"Patient":"hello , i am a b-thallasemia major patient since birth. i m 40 yrs old. i hve 2 ulcers on my right foot since 32 months. it is always burning , paining n itiching too much. i m taking also to many pain killers called paracetamol 500 mg each for the ulcers pain. i take blood transfusion 2 pints monthly. my ferritin is around 500 always. i take exjade since 2006 for iron overload. pls help me for my ulcers i m really fed up buy doing ulcers treatment 2 times a week n then it pains n burns too much. thank u very much. sateesh.","Doctor":"Hello SateeshThank you posting your query on HCMI would suggest you to get your blood sugar levels donetake care"},{"Patient":"When visiting my children in Crested Butte CO.

Since you have swallowing difficulty, you need evaluation with an upper GI endoscopy as the reason could be an obstruction due to growth in the food pipe. Sometimes it may be due to motility disorder which affects the contraction of the foodpipe. Esophageal manometry has to be done to rule this out.

I have studied your mail in detail. The cause of anemia are many, but in your case and the detail provided by you it can be due to: 1. Kidney disease related anemia: S. creatinine is 1.6 which is higher than the normal value. Kidney releases Erythropoietin which is required for formation of RBC's. 2.May be due to anticoagulant drug your are taking, which might causing slight bleed not see by naked eyes like in urine, stool, from gums while brushing, bleeding from ulcers etc.  Try to investigated it by urine R/E, stool for occult blood, Done your INR test which will confirm your blood thinning and helps in managing your dose of anticoagulants. 3.  As you are taking all the supplements which cause anemia so it is not nutrition deficiency anemia. 4.

Six weeks ago, he had a rabbit serum-based treatment. He has since been in the hospital with blood on his lungs; it is thought that his platelet transfusions should be increased to prevent the bleeding . In any event, his regular doctor told my sister-in-law yesterday that it would be a miracle if he survives. I realize that this is a very unusual disease with not much history to go on. However, aren t there other alternatives than just giving up? Thank you.","Doctor":"I'm very sorry to hear about your brother. Aplastic anemia is a very serious condition. The bone marrow shuts down and no longer makes any white blood cells (protective immune cells), red blood cells (vital oxygen carrying cells), or platelets (clotting cells). This can happen due to cancers, radiation exposure, certain drugs, and many other causes. Treatments vary and include steroids, injectable colony stimulating factors, transfusions (putting the cells in), and sometimes bone marrow transplantation. Transplantation is very hard to do because there must be an exact match (often a family member or child must donate, but even then a match is not guaranteed). However sometimes, depending on the actual reason for the anemia in the first place, the body starts making cells again on its own. Providing supportive care in the hospital is sometimes all we can do. I hope things get better for your brother and I will keep him and your family in my thoughts."},{"Patient":"Hi, I m a Nursing and from New Jersey. I m in my second semester and we had our clinical at a hospital yesterday. My patient , a 92 year old woman with a repaired hip fracture had a blood pressure of 130/45 and was due for Benazipril and Norvasc . I checked her last reading from her med. record and it was 139/43 2 1/2 hours earlier. My patient (who was awake, alert, and oriented) said she was concerned about receiving her blood pressure medication because her diastolic pressure was so low. I agreed it was low and said I would talk to my Nursing professor before I came back with the meds in case the dose needs to be withheld or reduced. my Nursing instructor then told me to talk her into getting the medication. She said my job is to sell it to her. I then went to the patient s primary nurse and explained the situation to her. She contacted the Dr. who withheld the meds for the day and had us monitor her BP more frequently. My question is what is the guideline for withholding BP meds? I feel that if I had listened to my Nursing instructor the patient may have been in trouble.","Doctor":"Hello. Thanks for writing to us. An abnormally low blood pressure readings- specially the diastolic blood pressure lower than 60mm of hg needs the anti hypertensive medicines to be withheld.

As per the Doctor, there is no allopathic treatment available for the syndrome except blood transfusions.","Doctor":"Hello This disorder is part of the heterogeneous category of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). According to the FAB classification of MDS, RAEB includes those patients with 5-20% blasts in the bone marrow (BM). Because the severity of the disease largely depends on the percentage of blasts in the BM, two categories of RAEB were recognised by the WHO classification, i.e. RAEB-1 and RAEB-2, with 5-9% and 10-19% blasts, respectively. Treatment of this condition in the elderly patient is largely supportive, including blood transfusion in patients with symptomatic anemia. Anemic patients with low serum erythropoietin (EPO) levels may benefit of the administration of rHu-EPO. Low dose cytarabine can be used to reduce the burden of blasts. Myeloablative regimens including anthracyclines and cytarabine in conventional or high doses can be used in high-risk patients under 60 years. Allogeneic bone marrow transplantation may offer a chance of cure in young patients. Median survival of RAEB falls in the 1-2 year range. The best outcome is usually observed in RAEB-1.

Sneezing might be due to some allergy.

The best way to control sneezing caused by allergies is to avoid exposure to the offending allergen. To reduce your exposure, remove pets if any,from the home to eliminate animal dander, use air filtration devices to reduce pollen in the air, travel to areas with low pollen counts. When allergies are the culprit, antihistamines are the first line of therapy which you are taking. Nasal steroid sprays may be helpful in more chronic conditions.

The normal range of the absolute eosinophil count is 0 - 450 /µL. So your child has mild elevation of eosinphils which can commonly be either due to allergic conditions or parasitic infestations in kids. If there are any symptoms of allergy like rhinitis, frequent cold cough, itching, wheezing etc then the treatment given is appropriate.Tablet L montus kid contains antihistamine levocetrizine and mast cell stabiliser monteleukast.Together this combination acts as an antiallergic and helps in bringing down the allergic response of the body like elevated eosinophil counts.So you may take the course and repeat the test for assessing response.

The cause would need to be determined by doing a bone marrow biopsy. The treatment would depend upon the identified cause. Meanwhile, I would suggest you get a platelet count done weekly and totally avoid situations where you can get injured. Your cholesterol levels are high and this has been found to predispose you to heart disease and other diseases of the blood vessels. They need to be managed with a mixture of dietary interventions and drugs like statins. Please have a low fat diet with your saturated fat intake Exercise for atleast 50 minutes daily. This should be primarily cardiovascular exercise like walking, jogging, skipping or swimming. Speak with your physician about the need for statins like atorvastatin.

I had a CT as couldn t afford MRI...and blood work done. Went back to doctor about not feeling better...given steroids, a shot for dangerous infection..another perscription for stronger antibiotic. CT scan showed some issues that pointed toward possible thyroid issue. Recommended thyroid workup and if not, more testing. Had thyroid test...normal. RA high. Went to another doctor...he said I was having a collegen attack...as I was having numbness around my mouth on same side as swollen puffy eye... sore inside mouth on that same side as the eye...etc. (Twenty years ago I was told I had collegen vascular disease and had steroid shots and prednisone. Have used Celebrex in the past but nothing for about ten years.)He gave me two steroid shots and prednisone. Sent me to RA doctor.

Sometime it is in my forhead or right side of head where the eye issue is. Most of my head pain is when I get up at night or in the morning when I get up. RA doctor said that is probably from fluid build up in my head when lying down????? Is this all connected? What should I do ??

I hurt so bad I had to have padding put on the bed...and even now I have to take a foam pad when we travel as my tissue is so sensitive. A lot of times after my allergic reactions to fragrances I have these flu like symptoms and go to bed with aches pains etc. This flare...was after a fragrance issue in December...I slept 24 hours one day in January as I was feeling so bad.... than the eye issue was next. The tissue was swollen all around it and water just ran and ran from it. There are still days when it waters a lot...and is puffy. It went down after the injections both times but never back to normal. There are still little bumpy feeling spots in my mouth on the same side as the eye issue also. Before the shots they were very painful at times...espically if I took a hot bath...I would have to get out after five minutes as the pain was unbearable.

On the right side I have very little range of motion. I have been dealing with this for 9 years. I am on 150 of Fentanyl, Vistaril, Ativan, Zanaflex, 8 mg of dilaudid for breakthrough pain, which is needed 3 times a day. I have never been seen by my doctors to have an issue with pain meds, I do not doctor shop, but even though the pain meds are the lesser of 2 evils, I need to find someone in the Minneapolis area who can treat me. I have been all over the country, they are either doubtful of surgical success, or afraid I will want them to take on my pain management, which is not true. I am 34 yrs old, female happily married, was a Medical Lab Tech, but havent worked since 03. I need to get my life back. How do I do that?","Doctor":"Hi, You hadn't mentioned the cause for the winging, whether it progresses gradually or develops suddenly. Anyways, scapular winging is usually congenital or traumatic. Winging that occurs as a result of nerve injury will recovers in two years and in these two years extensive physiotherapy will be done. Since your case is 7 years old, there are no chances of recovery anymore. Only surgical options are left now, surgery for scapular winging carries poor prognosis and high chances of recurrence. Surgical procedures involved are dynamic procedures like nerve transfers or static procedures like scapulothoracic fusion which procedures is best for you can be decided only after a thorough clinical examination.

I don t know what exactly, but slowly (in about month or two), everything was getting better, but not 100%, so I went to doctor. They said that there might be collateral ligament damaged, but they just said I should work out for my thigh muscles....But then once again (first time was december 2010, and then second time march 2011) the same thing happend (as if my knee went out of it s position and jupmed back). I went to doctor immediatley and I got crutch for one week and once again they said that cruciate ligaments look fine and that there might be latteral ligament streteched and that my kneepan moved too much -left and right; but there shouldn t be a problem if I strengthened my thigh muscle. But now after a half jear I want back to get note for MR (to be sure everything is OK), and the same doctor said I had crushed cruciate ligament (one of them, don t know which exactly), and that my kneepan really moves too much (the first time he said Arothmetere on left was -3+13 and on right -3+12) but now it was the same on left, and -3+18 on right (the injured one). He mentioned operation, but first of all I have to go to MR and then I ll see. Now my question is, can I got to fitness and work out for my thigh muscles or should I rather not? Because I didn t went to MR the first time, I don t know for sure if there was something wrong with crucial ligaments the first time, and now is-so did doctor not notice that the first time, or did that happen while training again after injury (nothing similar happend after the second injury). I probably shouldn t train now until I get MR results, but can I got to fitness and train my muscles so at least something will be done? I don t have any pain, but I can t contract my leg fully (if I can contract my left leg 100%, I can do with right 90%), and it s a bit strange when I try to contract it fully, as if something jumped left and right(or in and out)...And I can feel some bone on the upper right side of the knee that jumpes a bit when I extend or contract my leg (it s the same on the left, but if I want to notice that on the left I have to press my finger on it...on the right it s more obvious).

As you are already doing what is required to relieve pain, the possibility is that either your fracture got displaced or you are having a bursitis of the overlying bursa.

As you didn't mention the cancer type as well as the treatment that you are receiving at present, it is difficult to point out the exact cause of muscle loss. Most of the chemotherapy drugs causes loss of muscle. Moreover age is another factor, over 40 years target is to maintain the muscle mass rather then gaining it, until and unless you are taking excessive testosterone supplementation. Muscle building is a long and gradual process, gain in muscles size while exercising is is called pumping and it occurs because of pooling of blood in the muscles and not because of actual increase in the muscle fibre count, it is expected to revert back to normal within minutes to an hour depending on the intensity of exercise.

If you are an active person, athletic and have been doing stretches and exercises on your own you could have an inflammation of the IT band which is a strong band of tissue along the outer side of the knee.

I am 35 yrs old, female, 5 4 and 357 lbs... my doctor doesnt seem to help me when i need it, I feel she does nothing because im on Medicare and MaineCare which are state and federal funded health...Its not fair to me for her to judge me and always let me suffer","Doctor":"Hi, Your pain seems to be cervical in origin as it radiates all the way from shoulder up to your thumb. You need to have an MRI of the cervical spine done to rule out root compression. The other cause may be plexopathy which is quiet rare and associated with weakness as well. Take care.

Has been intermitant this is the first time I ve noticed lasting for 24 hours+, no health issues, good blood pressure, non diabetic, I sit at a computer all day. Could I be compressing some nerve or blood vessel?","Doctor":"Hi, Numbness localized to foot area is either a result of nerve root compression which is usually unilateral or peripheral neuropathy which is usually bilateral. As you have a prolonged sitting job chances are more towards the root compression. All you need to do is to improve your posture,along with some physiotherapy, if it improves in a week or two that's good, if not then you need to have a thorough clinical evaluation before proceeding further.

Less than 5 minutes a rather large lump had grown on the top right side of my right foot, just below my ankle. How should I treat this throbbing aching pain and reduce the heated swelling?","Doctor":"Hi, As per your history it appears that by saying sitting, you mean crossing legs and sitting. It is very common to have this after we age a bit, and the cause for it is stoppage of axoplasm flow in the nerves because of compression. This is not a disease but a common occurrence only that occurs with advancing age and with weight gain. Swelling is caused by stoppage of venous outflow while the arterial flow continues..the only remedy is to stop sitting by crossing your legs. Take care. Hope I have answered your question.

As you didn't mention the treatment that she had undergone that time, we can't elucidate whether any of the medications given at that time were actually responsible for it or not.

He is on various meds for blood pressure, cholesterol, acid reflux. Always has sweaty palms.","Doctor":"Hello, Extreme coldness in the shin & feet are commonly due to peripheral vascular disease, diabetes, arteriosclerosis, etc. It is due to decrease in the blood circulation in the arteries or narrowing of the arteries due to fatty deposits that decrease the blood flow. You are suggested to get him clinically examined by a GP. Get all the blood workouts, Urinalysis, CT, MRI, Nerve conduction tests, etc done at the earliest. He should also get cholesterol tests, chest x-ray, Duplex scanning, an echocardiogram, an electrocardiogram (ECG or EKG), an exercise stress test done to detect arteriosclerosis. If diabetic, get blood glucose level controlled at every cost. Neglect may trigger the symptoms. His vitals should be normal.

On the weekend I again caught the flu, started taking Herron tablets and woke up two days ago with absolutely no hip pain? May I add that prior to experiencing the flu three months ago I had 4 deep tissue massages, then got the flu and my health went down hill. Do you think I had a hip infection after the flu?","Doctor":"Hi, By your description, this does not look like infection. As such hip infection after flu is very uncommon. This can be something else, but looks like a hip pathology only. I would suggest you to undergo MRI of hip if you keep experiencing such pains, also get a DEXA scan done to rule out transient osteoporosis of hip. Infection will be ruled out after basic blood tests, CBC, ESR, CRP. Take care. Hope I have answered your question. Let me know if I can assist you further.

Ladder climbing especially can over stretch the calf muscles which is attached very close to the knee. So this could be a bruised and stretched calf muscle especially a muscle known as the plantaris which is known to snap during strenuous sports.

The 1st doctor I went to diagnosed it to be a sprain and advised me to wear a compressive ankle socks with just some ointments and anti inflamatory drugs . I continued carrying on normal activity without giving the leg much rest . A week later i went to another doctor who advised partial rest with the same ankle socks Another week and with an MRI scan i was diagnosed with a ligament tear of the right ankle . I was made to take complete rest with a plaster of paris to support the leg . My movement was restricted completely as the cast was too heavy . Since i m someone use to sleeping on my right side i could not avoid sleeping on the right ankle despite the cast . Ws taking Zerodol tablets . The cast was put for 3 weeks and was removed on August 17th . As there was tremendous swelling i was given was therapy for a week . Even after that i restrcited my movement keeping my leg elevated as much as i can and tried walking with the help of a walker . I have got back to work on September 12th . An 8 hrs of desk job and climbing stairs my leg swells profusly and by the end of the day it looks like i have a mild elephantisis on the right foot.

So to answer your questions it is not normal for the foot to swell up so severely even after two months of removal of the cast. Complete healing of the will depend on if you have a blocked vein or a chronic deep vein thrombosis. For this you need you need to a Doppler study which is a ultrasound examination which will tell you will need if the veins are OK, if the  other parts of the limb are OK. Now since the swelling is there for  a long time you will need to use anti DVT stockings (or anti varicose vein stockings) which goes above the knee. This should be worn through out the day.

It showed a tibial stress reaction. This stress reaction is in the exact spot that I had an Osteiod osteoma yrs ago. I am now 44. The Oncologist I was seeing referred me to an Ortho. The Ortho told me he was certain what the problem could be. He gave me a Cam walker and told me to come back in two weeks. A few days later, I had an episode of intense screaming pain. I called his office and asked for a bone scan. A few days after that I had to call my doctor to try to get an answer on the results of the scan. I couldn t directly speak with him. But his PA said that I had some uptake on my knee and ankle. She couldn t say much, but said the doctor stated that it is not arthritis and that he is clueless and may need to refer me to another doctor. I will be seeing my doctor tomorrow to go over the results and be reexamed. Would on ortho doctor refer me to another ortho? What could be the issue with my leg? The last few nights the pain has woken me up and the doctor has now given me some pain meds that work, but make me nauseous. Any ideas or advice? BTW, they say the tumor did not come back.","Doctor":"Hi, Increased bone uptake means increased bone formation at that particular site,either may be because of a stress fracture or a neoplasia. It is not peculiar to have intense pain in a stress fracture, pain remains the same until and unless you stressed that part acutely. While a neoplasia will become quiet evident after so many investigations, though osteoid osteoma is a benign tumor still there is 5-10 chances of its recurrence, osteoid osteoma is very painful too. To reach out for a diagnosis they will opt for a biopsy. Take care. Hope I have answered your question. Let me know if I can assist you further.

I don’t have any important health problems. 6 years ago I started feeling pain in my right foot. My doctor’s diagnose was metatarsalgia due to flat feet and he recommended me to wear orthopedic insoles (custom made). They solved the problem for a couple of years but then the pain came back. I went to the doctor again and he recommended a different type of insoles (with a small ‘bump’ in the middle). They worked out for a couple of years. Unfortunately now I have a feeling of discomfort and pain even when I’m wearing them. Another alarming tip: until 3 years ago I was able to wear sandals for a couple of days (and not wear my insoles) during the hottest summer days. Now I can’t dare not to use my insoles even for 1 day because otherwise I feel a terrible pain in my foot. Extra tip: my second right toe is longer than the big one. I haven’t gained any weight lately and my activities haven’t changed. I don’t walk a lot and I don’t practice any sports. I never wear high heels and my footwear is comfortable. I had X-rays in my feet 6 months ago and the 2 doctors that saw it told me there was nothing wrong. These doctors said that the only solution to my pain is wearing insoles but they aren’t working right now. What do I have to do? (I m wearing brand new insoles right now.)","Doctor":"Hi, There are variety of insoles available in the market ranging from medial arch support to metatarsal bar. The disadvantages of using them is the loss of strength of those muscles whose function is been sub-served by the insoles. All you need to do is to keep on changing from one type of insole to another type after every couple of months and to do physiotherapy exercises to strengthen your foot muscles. Take care.

Later that evening when he was in bed he threw up. He woke up the next morning with some dry heaves and then whatever he ate soda cracker, gingerale etc within a few minutes would come back up. I figured it was the flu by Monday evening he ate dinner and 15 minutes later up it came. Tuesday we had the same thing. We tried giving him a powerade a Tablespoon at a time every 10 minutes and for 60 minutes he kept that down until I introduced a cracker then it al came back up. We started over and went 90 minutes and tried a bite of banana, he threw that up and then fell asleep for the night. Yesterday he begged me to eat and I gave him some chicken and he threw that up. SO we went back to the liquid every 10 minutes, Made it 90 minutes with a bite of banana after 60 minutes and another after 30 more minutes. I then took him to the doctors and he complained of getting a headache while ridding in the car. The doctor gave hom a perscription for Zoloft and the druggist gave us a generic substitute. He took it and 30 minutes later he ate dinner a sirloin burger, fries and a peach with ice water (because he was starving) he eventually threw up some clear liquid, after 30 minutes part of the burger came up. We went back to a Tbsp of powerade every 10 miutes and then switched that to water. He fell asleep for the night around 10:30 and woke at 9:30. He asked for breakfast, we gave him a pill and 30 minutes later two homemade cheese biscuits, they came back up within minutes.

Can you tell me if the nerve root injection was wise, shortly after the injection the fracture of the L5 was discovered. I am in alot of discomfort and tend to do better when laying flat or up walking, sitting does me no favors.

I have a fairly complicated scenario which I d appreciate some guidance as to the underlying reasons for my symptoms. Symptoms: Joint Pain (hip, shoulder, knees, spine), Consistent Swelling in my Achilles Heel, and general fatigue. X-Rays show some minor joint damage in my hip. Had days of intense pain as a result. I have been diagnose by a rheumatologist as having psoriatic arthritis. Currently taking sulfasalazine (3000mg) and proxicam (20mg) daily. Maybe I m just in denial but I would like to test an alternative theory on why I may have these symptoms. I have realized I have been under eating for about a 2-3 year period. My daily intake of calories apparently should be around 2500-2800 Calories a day. I would be lucky if I had more then 2000 daily and would consistently have less, which has been the case for many years. I bottomed out at 65kg, which is quite underweight considering I m 180cms in height and Male. Before I had any symptoms I was going to the gym about 5 days a week and was doing pretty intense workouts which I also did for years. My question is, could my symptoms be caused by my diet? I have been diagnosed with psoriatic arthritis, however is it possible that my long term undereating has manifested in a way that would be paralleled by this disease? It is a clinical diagnosis, therefore it s hard to know for sure. I ve had various blood tests which are indicative of this disease through ESR and CRP blood counts. Can undereating long term raise these blood markers?","Doctor":"Hi, These symptoms cant be due to under eating, and under eating also do not raise your blood parameters, although by under eating you might have vitamins deficiency but none of your symptoms are related with vitamin deficiency.

Many thanks for your answer .","Doctor":"Hello, There would be many causes for shoulder blade pain, but if it occurs specifically after eating it indicates more towards radiating pain rather then musculoskeletal pain. Radiating pain may emanatesfrom visceral organs pathology like lung pathology including pleuritis,heart pathology like infarction or myocarditispancreatitis,pancreatic duct lithiasis ,GERD or involvement of diaphragm or spleen. But since it occurs specifically after eating diagonosis goes more in favour of stomach or pancreatic pathology.

After a slip and fall accident landing hard on left buttock near hip I have been suffering unbearable amount of pain. Looked at only for skelatal problems and none were found through CT and X rays.

Pain radiates across low back and through to front low pelvic region. I had a radical hysterectomy about a year before this slip and fall could it be broad ligament damage?","Doctor":"Hi, Most of the ligament injuries to the hip occurs in case of dislocations.

I asked around on the internet and I found a lot of people who had had it before, teenagers and adults alike. They told me that it goes away in about a week and that it was caused by putting antiperspirant on too soon after a shower. It did shrink away, disappearing after a little more than one week. There s still a small bump where the larger cyst used to be though, and I was supposed to go to a doctor about it. Now, the vein. For a while I had been feeling a slight discomfort in my left armpit whenever I lifted my arm up too high--and I also sleep with my arm up, under my pillow and head, and that would cause me discomfort as well. Yesterday I was pressing my fingers into my underarm and I felt... this vein that kind of protruded at the place where my underarm crease is. I can only feel it when my left arm is lifted up high enough, stretching my armpit. What is this? Now I m afraid to lift my armpit too high because I m afraid I ll snap that vein or something! I hate veins the way some people are creeped out by blood. My mom told me to take some ibuprofen, thinking it s an inflamed vein.

After attempting the operation they found a large amount of inflammation sticking to his bladder and prostate. They started him on pre-op FOLFOX to shrink the tumor so they can remove it. Meanwhile, we heard nothing concerning the node, only that it wasn t related to the Colon Cancer. They removed the node and said it looked clean, a week later they told us that it wasn t. They found a sarcoma in the node during biopsy. That was the first time we herd the word Castleman s. Over the period of a month it was bounced around. It could be, it probably isn t, it looks like it, it s so rare it s doubtful.... Now even his oncologist is referring to it as Castleman s Disease. They are still steadily treating the Colon Cancer (for which I m grateful), but not doing much concerning this. The did a PET scan and found that the other nodes in his right inguinal region are also swollen and said it would be something to discuss after he has his resection and post-operative chemo.

An ultrasound of the gall bladder revealed only a possible small polyp but a HIDA scan showed 5% ejection fraction so it was removed.

Initially the pain was about 2-5 lasting for a few minutes 1 or 2x per day, now it goes up to 4-6 with pulses to perhaps 7 and multiple times a day, again associated with sharp bending at the waist (the pain appears a few minutes after I bend). After the gall blader removal I also had a double contrast ct performed, which revealed no major problems including nothing post operative, and no appendix problems. There was only some mild perinephric inflammation. During this scan I placed a marker on my abdomen where the pains are present and the ct report stated that the marker was above the cecum. I also had a colonoscopy as a 50th birthday check after the pains started and while they found and removed 4 polyps, they saw nothing that would cause the pain.

It is not uncommon to have a long standing pain in the abdomen with no apparent cause after multiple investigations.

During my annual physical I showed it to my Gynecologist. She said that I have an Inguinal Hernia. She sent me to a Surgeon, but he couldn't really tell if it was or wasn't a hernia. I started having pain and swelling again, so I went to see a different Surgeon. Because the swelling had went down he too could not say for sure that it was or wasn't a hernia. I've noticed that it only swells up during certain times of the month. By the time I make an appointment & go to see the doctor; the swelling has gone down making it hard to identify. I've had this problem for almost 2yrs. Is there anything I can do?","Doctor":"Hi.The swelling in the groin can be a Lymph node or a Hernia. Hernia is a swelling which is expansible - meaning swelling is increased on straining like during coughing and is Reducible- meaning can be pressed down on pressure. Whereas the lymph node is neither expansible or reducible. The simple test at home and by Your Surgeon can diagnose this easily and ultrasonography can help differentiate between the both. Get operated for two reasons. The disease is gone and one gets the perfect diagnosis."},{"Patient":"I cant open my jaw more than an inch after i had 2 seizures recently, I am waiting for a neurologist to see me.
