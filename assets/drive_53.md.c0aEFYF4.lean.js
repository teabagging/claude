Since the circuit is closed, the total length is given by:   [   s + p + d = 600   ]   Given that the circuit is symmetric in terms of uphill and downhill, we have (s = d).

This implies:   [   (a+1)! equiv (a+2)! equiv cdots equiv (n-1)! equiv 0 pmod{n}   ]   For these remainders to be different, ( n ) must be such that ( n-a = 1 ), which implies ( n = 2 ).3.

The second solution, which won the BAMO 2001 Brilliancy Prize, is due to Andrew Dudzik of Lynbrook HS.

For n=0, note that f(1) neq 1, otherwise 3=f(f(1))=f(1)=1, which is impossible. Since f(k) is a positive integer for all positive integers k, we conclude that f(1)>1. Since f(n+1)>f(n), f is increasing. Thus 1<f(1)<f(f(1))=3 or f(1)=2. Hence f(2)=f(f(1))=3.Suppose that for some positive integer n geq 1,fleft(3^{n}right)=2 cdot 3^{n} text { and } fleft(2 cdot 3^{n}right)=3^{n+1} text {. }Then,fleft(3^{n+1}right)=fleft(fleft(2 cdot 3^{n}right)right)=2 cdot 3^{n+1}andfleft(2 cdot 3^{n+1}right)=fleft(fleft(3^{n+1}right)right)=3^{n+2},as desired. This completes the induction, and establishes the lemma.Continuing with our solution, there are 3^{n}-1 integers m such that 3^{n}<m<2 cdot 3^{n} and there are 3^{n}-1 integers m^{prime} such thatfleft(3^{n}right)=2 cdot 3^{n}<m^{prime}<3^{n+1}=fleft(2 cdot 3^{n}right) .Since f is an increasing function,fleft(3^{n}+mright)=2 cdot 3^{n}+mfor 0 leq m leq 3^{n}. Thereforefleft(2 cdot 3^{n}+mright)=fleft(fleft(3^{n}+mright)right)=3left(3^{n}+mright)for 0 leq m leq 3^{n}. Hencef(2001)=fleft(2 cdot 3^{6}+543right)=3left(3^{6}+543right)=3816 .Solution 2: (Sketch) Andrew Dudzik's insight was to recognize that f(n) deals in a very simple way, with the base- 3 representation of n. Let n=a_{1} a_{n} cdots a_{t} be the base- 3 digits of n. For example, if n=50 in base 10, we would write n=1212 in base 3 and hence a_{1}=1, a_{2}=2, a_{3}=1, a_{4}=2. Dudzik proved the following:1. If a_{1}=1, then f(n)=2 a_{2} a_{3} cdots a_{t}.2. If a_{1}=2, then f(n)=1 a_{2} a_{3} cdots a_{t} 0These two statements can be proven easily with induction; we leave this an an exercise for the reader. Note that Dudzik's formulas allow us to immediately compute f (2001). In base-3 notation, 2001 is equal to 2202010. Thus, by formula #2,f(2202101)=12020100=1 cdot 3^{2}+2 cdot 3^{4}+2 cdot 3^{6}+3^{7},and this equals 3816 in base-10 notation."},{"problem":"5.

In order to attract more customers, the online store has taken a price reduction measure. According to market research, for each yuan reduction in the price of each pair of pants, they can sell an additional 5 pairs per month.

The profit for each pair of pants is the selling price minus the cost (x - 40), and the total profit is this difference multiplied by the number of pairs sold (y). Substituting the expression for y gives:[w = (x - 40)(-5x + 500)]Expanding this expression and simplifying:[begin{align*}w &= -5x^2 + 500x - 40(-5x) - 40(500) &= -5x^2 + 500x + 200x - 20000 &= -5x^2 + 700x - 20000end{align*}]To find the maximum profit, we complete the square:[w = -5(x^2 - 140x) - 20000][w = -5(x^2 - 140x + 4900) + 4500 - 20000][w = -5(x - 70)^2 + 4500]Since the coefficient of the quadratic term is negative (-5), the parabola opens downwards, indicating that the maximum profit occurs at the vertex of the parabola, which is at x = 70. Substituting x = 70 into the equation for w gives:[w = -5(0)^2 + 4500 = 4500]Therefore, the price of each pair of pants should be reduced by 80 - 70 = 10 yuan to maximize the monthly profit, and the maximum profit is boxed{4500} yuan."},{"problem":"(1) Given x gt 1, y gt 1, and x+y=4.

Let ( P(x) = ax^2 + bx + c ) be a quadratic polynomial. We need to find the maximum number of integers ( n ge 2 ) such that ( P(n+1) = P(n) + P(n-1) ).2. First, express ( P(n+1) ), ( P(n) ), and ( P(n-1) ):   [   P(n+1) = a(n+1)^2 + b(n+1) + c = a(n^2 + 2n + 1) + b(n + 1) + c = an^2 + (2a + b)n + (a + b + c)   ]   [   P(n) = an^2 + bn + c   ]   [   P(n-1) = a(n-1)^2 + b(n-1) + c = a(n^2 - 2n + 1) + b(n - 1) + c = an^2 - 2an + a + bn - b + c   ]3. Set up the equation ( P(n+1) = P(n) + P(n-1) ):   [   an^2 + (2a + b)n + (a + b + c) = an^2 + bn + c + an^2 - 2an + a + bn - b + c   ]4.

Combine like terms and equate coefficients:   [   an^2 + (2a + b)n + (a + b + c) = 2an^2 + (2b - 2a)n + (a - b + 2c)   ]   [   0 = an^2 + (b - 4a)n + (c - 2b)   ]6. This is a quadratic equation in ( n ):   [   an^2 + (b - 4a)n + (c - 2b) = 0   ]7. A quadratic equation can have at most 2 distinct integer solutions. Therefore, the maximum number of terms ( n ge 2 ) such that ( P(n+1) = P(n) + P(n-1) ) is 2.8.

In other words, when the 100 numbers are divided into the following 5 groups:S_{j}={5 k+j mid k=0,1,2, cdots, 19}, j=1,2,3,4,5, during the operation process, each number's position can only change within the group, and by appropriately arranging the operation sequence, each number can be moved to any other position within the group. Therefore, under the congruence relation, the relative positions of the 20 digits within each group are irrelevant, i.e., no matter how they are swapped, they are always congruent, and only the number of 1s within the group matters.

We start with the given expression for ( q ):   [   q = a + frac{1}{b} - frac{1}{b + frac{1}{c}}   ]   We need to ensure that ( q ) is a positive rational number and that when ( q ) is written in lowest terms, the numerator is divisible by 13.2. First, simplify the expression for ( q ):   [   q = a + frac{1}{b} - frac{1}{b + frac{1}{c}}   ]   To simplify (frac{1}{b + frac{1}{c}}), we rewrite it as:   [   frac{1}{b + frac{1}{c}} = frac{1}{frac{bc + 1}{c}} = frac{c}{bc + 1}   ]   Thus, the expression for ( q ) becomes:   [   q = a + frac{1}{b} - frac{c}{bc + 1}   ]3. Combine the terms over a common denominator:   [   q = a + frac{(bc + 1) - bc}{b(bc + 1)} = a + frac{1}{b(bc + 1)}   ]4. For ( q ) to be a positive rational number, the numerator of the fraction (frac{1}{b(bc + 1)}) must be positive, which it is since ( b, c in [1, 12] ).5. Next, we need to ensure that when ( q ) is written in lowest terms, the numerator is divisible by 13. This means:   [   a + frac{1}{b(bc + 1)} = frac{p}{q}   ]   where ( gcd(p, q) = 1 ) and ( 13 mid p ).6. To satisfy this condition, we need:   [   ab(bc + 1) equiv -1 pmod{13}   ]   This is because the numerator of ( q ) in lowest terms must be divisible by 13.7. Since ( a, b, c in [1, 12] ), we need to find the number of ordered triples ((a, b, c)) such that:   [   ab(bc + 1) equiv -1 pmod{13}   ]8. Note that (gcd(ab^2, 13) = 1), so for each pair ((a, b)), there is a unique ( c ) modulo 13 that satisfies the equation. However, ( c neq 0 ) modulo 13.9. If ( c equiv 0 pmod{13} ), then:   [   ab equiv -1 pmod{13}   ]   Since (gcd(a, 13) = 1), for each ( a ), there is a unique ( b ) modulo 13 that satisfies this equation.10. We need to reject the pairs where ( c equiv 0 pmod{13} ). There are 12 such pairs (one for each ( a )).11.

Then we have x^2 = 576-560 implies x = 4.We have AO_A = BD because of the rectangle, so sqrt{11^2-r^2} = sqrt{13^2-r^2}-4.Squaring, we have 121-r^2 = 169-r^2 + 16 - 8 cdot sqrt{169-r^2}.Subtracting, we get 8 cdot sqrt{169-r^2} = 64 implies sqrt{169-r^2} = 8 implies 169-r^2 = 64 implies r^2 = 105.We also notice that since we had sqrt{169-r^2} = 8 means that BO_B = 8 and since we know that x = 4, AO_A = 4.We take a cross-section that contains A and C, which contains these two spheres but not the third, as shown below:We have CO_C = sqrt{19^2-r^2} = sqrt{361 - 105} = sqrt{256} = 16. Since AO_A = 4, we have EO_C = 16-4 = 12. Using Pythagorean theorem, O_AE = sqrt{30^2 - 12^2} = sqrt{900-144} = sqrt{756}.

Solution: The value of each unknown can only be one of the numbers 0, pm 1, pm 2, ldots, pm 999, but the choice of one value imposes a restriction on the other. Let's go through each value of x and determine the number of possible y values that solve the equation with it; the sum of these numbers will give us the answer to our question. - First, let's consider the non-negative values of x.For x=0, |y|<1000, i.e., -1000<y<1000, which is satisfied by -999, -998, ldots, -1, 0, 1, ldots, 999, the number of which is 2 cdot 999 + 1 = 1999.For x=1, |y|<999, there are 2 fewer solutions than before, because y = pm 999 no longer fits.In general, when transitioning from a certain value of x to the next higher one, the largest possible value of |y| decreases by 1, so we need to remove two of the previous values of y, and the number of solutions for x, y decreases by 2. Thus, the number of solutions for x=0, 1, 2, ldots, 999 forms an arithmetic sequence. The last term for x=999 is 1, the number of terms is 1000, and thus their sum is:frac{1000(1999+1)}{2} = 1000^2For x=-1, -2, ldots, -999, |x|=1, 2, ldots, 999, similarly, the total number of such solutions is1997 + 1995 + ldots + 1 = 999^2With this, we have considered all solutions, and their total number is: 1000^2 + 999^2 = 1998001.II. Solution: The question is clear with the following: how many pairs of integers x, y are there such that the sum |x| + |y| is either 0, 1, 2, ..., or 999? Therefore, let's determine the number N_k of integer solutions to the equation |x| + |y| = k, where k is a non-negative integer, and sum these for k=0, 1, 2, ldots, 999.For k=0, there is one solution: x = y = 0.For k=1, there are four suitable value pairs:1, 0; -1, 0; 0, 1; 0, -1.For k geq 2, we divide the solutions into two groups depending on whether the number 0 appears in them or not. For the first group, similar to the case k=1, there are 4 solutions: k, 0; -k, 0; 0, k; 0, -k. For the second group, |x| can take the following k-1 values:|x| = j = 1, 2, 3, ldots, k-1and with this, |y| is also determined:|y| = k - j = k - 1, k - 2, k - 3, ldots, 1For each value of j, considering the signs, 4 solutions arise, because j and k-j can each independently take 2 signs:j, k-j; -j, k-j; j, -(k-j); -j, -(k-j)Thus, the number of solutions in this case is 4(k-1). - In total, for k geq 2, the number of solutions is 4 + 4(k-1) = 4k. This expression is also valid for k=1, in which case the second group does not contain solutions; however, it is not valid for k=0.After this, for k=0, 1, 2, ldots, 999:N = 1 + 4(1 + 2 + 3 + ldots + 999) = 1 + 4 cdot frac{999 cdot 1000}{2} = 1998001Remark. Similarly, if s is a non-negative integer, then the number of solutions to the inequality |x| + |y| < s in integers is:N_s = 1 + 4[1 + 2 + 3 + ldots + (s-1)] = 2s^2 - 2s + 1III. Solution: Each solution is represented in a rectangular coordinate system by a so-called lattice point, i.e., a point whose both coordinates are integers. Let's characterize the position of these lattice points, then determine their number and answer the question."},{"problem":"Example 3 Let the set S={1,2, cdots, 280}. Find the smallest positive integer n, such that every subset of S with n elements contains five pairwise coprime numbers.(32nd IMO)","solution":"【Analysis】The required n satisfies: there exists an (n-1)-element subset A subset S, such that in any 5-element subset of A, there are two elements that are not coprime. n-1 is the maximum value for which there exists a subset A satisfying the above condition.If A can be written as the union of four sets A_{1}, A_{2}, A_{3}, A_{4}, and each set contains elements that are pairwise not coprime, then by the pigeonhole principle, we know that in any 5-element subset of A, there are two elements in the same A_{i}, which are not coprime. A simple construction method for a set of elements that are pairwise not coprime is to take the set of integer multiples of a fixed number. Thus, let A_{1}, A_{2}, A_{3}, A_{4} be the sets of positive integers with the smallest prime factors being 2, 3, 5, 7 respectively, and not exceeding 280.Applying the principle of inclusion-exclusion, we calculate:left|A_{1} cup A_{2} cup A_{3} cup A_{4}right|=216.Therefore, we conjecture that n=217.To prove that any 217-element subset C of S contains five pairwise coprime elements. This is a type of problem where the pigeonhole principle applies, requiring the construction of pigeonholes, with each pigeonhole containing numbers that are pairwise coprime:begin{aligned}B_{1}= & {1} cup{text{ primes not exceeding } 280 }, B_{2}= & {text{ squares of primes not less than } 17 }, B_{3}= & {2 times 41,3 times 37,5 times 31,7 times 29, & 11 times 23,13 times 19}, B_{4}= & {2 times 37,3 times 31,5 times 29,7 times 23, & 11 times 19,13 times 17}, B_{5}= & {2 times 31,3 times 29,5 times 23,7 times 19,11 times 17}, B_{6}= & {2 times 29,3 times 23,5 times 19,7 times 17,11 times 13}.end{aligned}Thus, B_{1} cup B_{2} cup cdots cup B_{6} includes all numbers not in A = A_{1} cup A_{2} cup cdots cup A_{4}, and each B_{i} contains exactly four elements from A. If there is a set C containing at least 217 elements, C contains more elements in some B_{i} than A does in B_{i}, i.e., left|C cap B_{i}right| geqslant 5, then C contains five elements that are pairwise coprime.Therefore, the smallest n satisfying the problem's conditions is 217.【Comment】In Example 3, the two sets of pigeonholes A_{i} (i=1,2,3, 4) and B_{j} (j=1,2, cdots, 6) satisfy:left|A_{i} cap B_{j}right|=1,left|A_{i} cap A_{i^{prime}}right|=0,left|B_{j} cap B_{j^{prime}}right|=0;The union of all A_{i} and B_{j} is the entire set S;Elements in A_{i} are pairwise satisfying a certain condition, while elements in B_{j} are pairwise not satisfying this condition.Regardless of how this condition is described, if such types of pigeonhole sets can be constructed, then the solution to the corresponding problem is the number of elements in the union of A_{i} plus 1.In Example 4, when using the pigeonhole principle, it is necessary to reasonably adjust the pigeonholes."},{"problem":"Baranovv D.V.Andrey and Boris are playing the following game.

Since P(z)=0 is a real-coefficient equation, the imaginary roots appear in pairs, so the number of roots in the first quadrant is equal to the number of roots in the fourth quadrant, and the number of roots in the second quadrant is equal to the number of roots in the third quadrant.Now we only need to discuss the number of roots of P(z)=0 in the first quadrant.Let z_{1}=r mathrm{e}^{mathrm{i} theta}left(0<theta<frac{pi}{2}right).

So, we assume ( n geqslant 4 ). Since there were at most ( n ) votes, there is at least one student who received at most one vote: we call this student Donald. By forgetting Donald and fraudulently \\"forgetting\\" the vote he might have received, replacing it with a blank vote, Théo can distribute the remaining ( n-1 ) students into at most three groups.Then Théo brings Donald back into the class: among the three groups, there is at least one that does not contain the person for whom Donald might have voted, nor the potential voter of Donald.

It was then necessary, for all ( n ), to provide an example of a vote for which 3 groups were necessary.Subsequently, numerous strategies for distributing the students into 3 groups were proposed, but few were correct. In such a case, trying to prove that the distribution works is always useful: either the distribution is correct, and proving it is necessary to get all the points; or it is not, and failing to prove it often helps to understand why the strategy fails. It is also important not to hesitate to test the distribution given for certain votes: this often easily reveals the problems.Finally, some students transformed the problem into a graph coloring problem, then claimed that if one could color any subset of 4 vertices of the graph without having two adjacent vertices of the same color, one could color the entire graph without having two adjacent vertices of the same color.

He cannot do better, because if mathrm{b} is the biggest of the 4 piles, then the smallest is at most m-b. Hence A's best strategy is to leave [mathrm{N} / 2],[(mathrm{N}+1) / 2].Under R 2, if A leaves mathrm{a}=2, mathrm{~b}=mathrm{N}-2, then mathrm{B} cannot do better than [ mathrm{N} / 2], because if he divides the larger pile into a, b with a leq b, then he takes a+1. A cannot do better, because if he leaves mathrm{a}, mathrm{b} with 3 leq mathrm{a} leq mathrm{b}, then mathrm{B} can divide to leave 1, mathrm{a}-1,[b / 2],[(b+1) / 2]. Now if mathrm{a}-1 geq[(b+1) / 2], then B takes b geq[(N+1) / 2]. If a-1<[(b+1) / 2], then B takes a-1+[b / 2]. But a-1 geq 2 and [b / 2] geq[(b+1) / 2]- 1 , so mathrm{a}-1+[mathrm{b} / 2] geq 1+[(mathrm{b}+1) / 2], or mathrm{B} takes at least as many as A, so B takes at least [(mathrm{N}+1) / 2].Under R 3, A's best strategy is to divide into [mathrm{N} / 2],[(mathrm{N}+1) / 2]. We have already shown that mathrm{B} can secure [(mathrm{N}+1) / 2] and no more by following R 1. He cannot do better under R2, for if he divides so that the biggest pile comes from [N/2], then the smallest does too and so he gets [(mathrm{N}+1) / 2]. If he divides so that the biggest and smallest piles come from [(mathrm{N}+1) / 2], then he gets only [N/2]. But one of these must apply, because if he divided so that the smaller from [mathrm{N} / 2] was smaller than the smaller from [(mathrm{N}+1) / 2], and the bigger from [mathrm{N} / 2] was smaller than the bigger from [(mathrm{N}+1) / 2], then [mathrm{N} / 2] would be at least 2 less than [(mathrm{N}+1) / 2] (which it is not)."},{"problem":"63.

A collection F is said to be covering if every element of N is contained in at least one set A_{i} in F. What is the smallest value f(n) of t such that there is a set F=left{A_{1}, ldots, A_{t}right} that is simultaneously separating and covering?","solution":"10. We claim that if the family left{A_{1}, ldots, A_{t}right} separates the n-set N, then 2^{t} geq n. The proof goes by induction. The case t=1 is clear, so suppose that the claim holds for t-1. Since A_{t} does not separate elements of its own or its complement, it follows that left{A_{1}, ldots, A_{t-1}right} is separating for both A_{t} and N backslash A_{t}, so that left|A_{t}right|,left|N backslash A_{t}right| leq 2^{t-1}. Then |N| leq 2 cdot 2^{t-1}=2^{t}, as claimed. Also, if the set N with |N|=2^{t} is separated by left{A_{1}, ldots, A_{t}right}, then (precisely) one element of N is not covered. To show this, we again use induction. This is trivial for t=1, so let t geq 1. Since A_{1}, ldots, A_{t-1} separate both A_{t} and N backslash A_{t}, N backslash A_{t} must have exactly 2^{t-1} elements, and thus one of its elements is not covered by A_{1}, ldots, A_{t-1}, and neither is covered by A_{t}. We conclude that a separating and covering family of t subsets can exist only if n leq 2^{t}-1. We now construct such subsets for the set N if 2^{t-1} leq n leq 2^{t}-1, t geq 1. For t=1, put A_{1}={1}. In the step from t to t+1, let N=N^{prime} cup N^{prime prime} cup{y}, where left|N^{prime}right|,left|N^{prime prime}right| leq 2^{t-1}; let A_{1}^{prime}, ldots, A_{t}^{prime} be subsets covering and separating N^{prime} and A_{1}^{prime prime}, ldots, A_{t}^{prime prime} such subsets for N^{prime prime}. Then the subsets A_{i}=A_{i}^{prime} cup A_{i}^{prime prime} (i=1, ldots, t) and A_{t+1}=N^{prime prime} cup{y} obviously separate and cover N. The answer: t=left[log _{2} nright]+1. Second solution. Suppose that the sets A_{1}, ldots, A_{t} cover and separate N. Label each element x in N with a string of left(x_{1} x_{2} ldots x_{t}right) of 0 's and 1's, where x_{i} is 1 when x in A_{i}, 0 otherwise. Since the A_{i} 's separate, these strings are distinct; since they cover, the string ( 00 ldots 0 ) does not occur.  Hence n leq 2^{t}-1. Conversely, for 2^{t-1} leq n<2^{t}, represent the elements of N in base 2 as strings of 0's and 1's of length t. For 1 leq i leq t, take A_{i} to be the set of numbers in N whose binary string has a 1 in the i th place.

So the probability that they both pick two red candies is frac{9}{38} cdot frac{28}{153} = frac{14}{323}.  The same calculation works for the blue candies.  The probability that Terry picks two different candies is frac{20cdot10}{20cdot19} = frac{10}{19}, and the probability that Mary picks two different candies after Terry picks two different candies is frac{18cdot 9}{18cdot 17} = frac{9}{17}.

If the difference were 0, the numbers would be the same, which is not possible for consecutive numbers in the sequence. If the difference were greater than 1, there would be a gap between the numbers, which means there would be a number in between that could potentially have a sum of digits divisible by 5, contradicting the requirement that the sequence lists all such numbers in ascending order.

This region is a quarter of the circle, so its area is one-fourth the area of the entire circle.The area of a circle with radius r is given by A = pi r^2, so in this case, the area of the entire circle is pi(1)^2 = pi.

The problem states that the sales grew from 100 vehicles in January to 121 vehicles in March. Since there are two months between January and March, we can model the growth as follows:1. The sales in February would be 100(1+x), where x is the monthly growth rate.2. The sales in March, then, would be 100(1+x)^2 because the growth rate applies again to the February sales.Given that the sales in March are 121 vehicles, we set up the equation:[100(1+x)^2 = 121]Dividing both sides by 100 gives us:[(1+x)^2 = 1.21]Taking the square root of both sides, we find two possible values for 1+x:[1+x = pmsqrt{1.21}][1+x = pm1.1]This gives us two possible values for x:[x_1 = 1.1 - 1 = 0.1][x_2 = -1.1 - 1 = -2.1]Since a negative growth rate would imply the sales decreased, which contradicts the information given, we discard x_2 = -2.1. Therefore, the monthly average growth rate is:[x = 0.1]Converting this to a percentage:[0.1 times 100% = 10%]So, the monthly average growth rate of sales of this brand of new energy vehicles is boxed{10%}.# Part 2: Calculating the Total Profit from January to MarchTo find the total profit, we first calculate the total number of vehicles sold from January to March. With a 10% monthly growth rate:- January sales: 100 vehicles- February sales: 100 times (1+0.1) = 110 vehicles- March sales: 121 vehicles (given)The total sales from January to March is:[100 + 110 + 121 = 331]The profit per vehicle is the difference between the selling price and the cost price:[16.3 text{ million yuan} - 15.3 text{ million yuan} = 1 text{ million yuan}]Therefore, the total profit made by the dealer from January to March is:[331 times 1 = 331]So, the dealer made a total profit of boxed{331 text{ million yuan}} from January to March."},{"problem":"The eccentricity of the hyperbola frac {x^{2}}{16}- frac {y^{2}}{9}=1 is (　　)A:  frac {5}{4}B:  frac {5}{3}C:  frac { sqrt {7}}{4}D:  frac {25}{16}","solution":"From the equation of the hyperbola frac {x^{2}}{16}- frac {y^{2}}{9}=1, we can find that a=4, and c=5,Therefore, the eccentricity e= frac {c}{a} = frac {5}{4},Hence, the correct choice is: boxed{A}This problem tests the equation and properties of a hyperbola, mainly focusing on how to find the eccentricity of a hyperbola, which is a basic question."},{"problem":"16.

Here, the plot of a well-known matching problem is used, but the question is not about probability, but about the expectation and variance of the number of matches. Surprisingly, this problem is easier to solve than finding the probability. Again, we will use indicators.a) Let's number the pairs from 1 to N (we do not know how many they are) in the order in which they lie on the table. Let the indicator I_{k} be 1 if the two cards in the k-th pair are the same, and 0 if the cards in the k-th pair are different. Obviously, mathrm{P}left(I_{k}=1right)=frac{1}{N}. Therefore, I_{k} has a Bernoulli distributionI_{k} simleft(begin{array}{cc}0 & 1 frac{N-1}{N} & frac{1}{N}end{array}right)The expected value is: mathrm{E} I_{k}=frac{1}{N}. The expectation does not depend on k.Let S be the number of pairs with a match. It is equal to the sum of the indicators:S=I_{1}+I_{2}+ldots+I_{N}Transition to expectations: mathrm{E} S=mathrm{E} I_{1}+mathrm{E} I_{2}+ldots+mathrm{E} I_{N}=N cdot frac{1}{N}=1.b) Let's find the variance: mathrm{D} S=mathrm{E} S^{2}-(mathrm{E} S)^{2}=mathrm{E} S^{2}-1.The difficulty lies in the expectation of S^{2}.

To transition to the mathematical expectation, we need to find the distribution and expectation of the random variables I_{k}^{2} and I_{j} I_{k} for k neq j.The distribution of I_{k}^{2}, obviously, coincides with the distribution of I_{k}: I_{k}^{2} simleft(begin{array}{cc}0 & 1  frac{N-1}{N} & frac{1}{N}end{array}right).Therefore, mathrm{E} I_{k}^{2}=frac{1}{N}.Now consider the quantity I_{j} I_{k}. It is 1 if the cards match in both the j-th pair and the k-th pair. The cards in the j-th pair match with probability frac{1}{N}. If this happens, the probability of the cards matching in the k-th pair is frac{1}{N-1}.

Therefore, we can rewrite the expression as:left(-0.125times 8right)^{2021}times 8This simplifies to:left(-1right)^{2021}times 83. Since -1 raised to any odd power is -1, we have:left(-1right)^{2021} = -14.

Let the work rate of each bricklayer be denoted as ( r_i ) where ( i = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 ). The total work rate of all five bricklayers working together is the sum of their individual work rates. Since they complete the job in 3 hours, their combined work rate is:   [   r_1 + r_2 + r_3 + r_4 + r_5 = frac{1}{3} text{ jobs per hour}   ]2. Given that each bricklayer takes at most 36 hours to complete the job alone, the work rate of each bricklayer is at least:   [   r_i geq frac{1}{36} text{ jobs per hour}   ]3. To find the smallest number of minutes it could take the fastest bricklayer to complete the job alone, we assume that the other four bricklayers are the slowest possible, each taking 36 hours to complete the job.

We will present two here.a) Eliminate the unknowns x, y, for example, by first rearranging the equations:begin{aligned}x^{2}+y^{2} & =16-2 z^{2}, x y & =frac{24-z^{2}}{1+z^{2}}, x+y & =8-2 z .end{aligned}We then get(8-2 z)^{2}=(x+y)^{2}=x^{2}+y^{2}+2 x y=16-2 z^{2}+2 cdot frac{24-z^{2}}{1+z^{2}} .After rearrangement, we get3 z^{4}-16 z^{3}+28 z^{2}-16 z=0 .Given that we know z=2 is a root of this equation, we can rearrange it step by step to the formz(z-2)^{2}(3 z-4)=0 .From this, it follows that z=0, z=frac{4}{3}, or z=2.If z=0, we getbegin{aligned}x^{2}+y^{2} & =16, x y & =24, x+y & =8end{aligned}and it is easy to verify that this system has no solution (the numbers x, y would have to be the roots of the quadratic equation t^{2}-8 t+24=0, which has a negative discriminant).If z=frac{4}{3}, we getbegin{aligned}x^{2}+y^{2} & =frac{112}{9}, x y & =8, x+y & =frac{16}{3}end{aligned}and again it is easy to verify that this system has no solution.If z=2, we getbegin{aligned}x^{2}+y^{2} & =8, x y & =4, x+y & =4 .end{aligned}It is easy to see that this system has a unique solution x=y=2.b) A more clever approach uses only the first and third equations and the inequality between the quadratic and arithmetic means:4=2^{2}=left(frac{1}{4}(x+y+z+z)right)^{2} leqq frac{1}{4}left(x^{2}+y^{2}+z^{2}+z^{2}right)=4Equality between the arithmetic and quadratic means occurs precisely when all terms are equal. Hence, x=y=z=2.The case a=24, b=-8 is evaluated similarly, and in that case, the solution is also unique.Answer. The given system has a unique solution for a=24, b=8 or a=24, b=-8."},{"problem":"11.

The derivative of g(q) with respect to q is:g'(q)=frac{(q^7)'cdot(q^3-q)-q^7cdot(q^3-q)'}{(q^3-q)^2}=frac{7q^6(q^3-q)-q^7cdot3q^2}{(q^3-q)^2}=frac{7q^6q^3-7q^8-3q^9}{(q^3-q)^2}=frac{2q^5(2q^2-3)}{(q^3-q)^2}.Analyzing g'(q), we see:- For 1  sqrt{frac{3}{2}} Rightarrow g'(q) > 0, which implies that g(q) is an increasing function in the interval (sqrt{frac{3}{2}}, infty).Thus, the function g(q) reaches the minimum value when q = sqrt{frac{3}{2}}. Substituting this value into g(q), we find the minimum value of a_8+lambda a_9:gleft(sqrt{frac{3}{2}}right)=frac{left(sqrt{frac{3}{2}}right)^7}{left(sqrt{frac{3}{2}}right)^3-sqrt{frac{3}{2}}}=frac{27}{4}.Therefore, the minimum value of a_8+lambda a_9 is boxed{frac{27}{4}}."},{"problem":"6.

I tried numerous titles like \\"Entertaining Logic,\\" \\"Logical Amusements and Games,\\" but couldn't decide on a suitable one. Then I decided to look in the Great Encyclopedic Dictionary. Opening it to the entry \\"Amusements,\\" I read: \\"See Entertainment.\\" Following the advice, I learned a wealth of useful information about buffoonery, games, amusements, entertaining pastimes, pranks, diversions, jokes, jesting, and humor.

Nevertheless, you will soon see that the title \\"Silly Stuff\\" fits this section perfectly.","solution":"14. The fur must be white, as it belongs to a polar bear inhabiting the Arctic - near the North Pole. Usually, the answer is supported by the fact that the bear in the problem's conditions must be standing at the North Pole. If you step in any direction from the North Pole, you will always be moving south. Therefore, if the bear is at the North Pole and the hunter is 100 meters south of it, then, after walking 100 meters east and turning north, the hunter will face the North Pole. This is true, but as I have already said, the given solution is not the only one. Indeed, there are infinitely many solutions. For example, the hunter could be on a parallel 100 meters long, and the bear 100 meters north of him. Walking 100 meters east, the hunter will complete a full circle around the pole and return to the starting point. This is the second solution to the problem. But the hunter could be even closer to the pole on a parallel 50 meters long. Walking 100 meters, he will circle the pole twice and return to the starting point. But this is not all. The hunter could be on a parallel 1/3 of 100 meters long. Circling the pole three times along the parallel, he will also return to the starting point. Since a similar solution can be constructed for any positive integer ( n ), there are infinitely many places on Earth where the scenario described in the problem could have taken place.Of course, in all these solutions, it is assumed that a bear located close enough to the North Pole must necessarily be a polar bear. However, there is another possibility, albeit a very unlikely one: some malicious individual deliberately transported a brown bear to the North Pole to \\"spite\\" the author of the problem."},{"problem":"\\t Let PROBLEMZ be a regular octagon inscribed in a circle of unit radius.

Similarly, triangle ICO is also a right triangle because C is the center of the circle and I lies on the line segment CO.4. Tangent of Angles:   We observe that tan{angle ZOM} = tan{angle IOC}.

Note that all people cannot be liars, because then it would mean that each of them is telling the truth. Therefore, among these people, there is at least one knight. Let's number all the people so that the knight is the 1001st in the sequence. Then the 10 people with numbers from 1 to 10 are liars (this follows from the knight's statement). Moreover, the 10 people with numbers 991-1000 are also liars, as they made an incorrect statement (there is a knight among the ten people standing after them). Therefore, since these 10 people stand in a row along our circle after person number 990, he told the truth and, consequently, is also a knight. Repeating the reasoning for him, we get that people with numbers 980-989 are liars, and so on. In the end, we get that the knights are people with numbers 1001, 990, 979, ldots, 11, that is, there are a total of 1001 / 11 = 91 of them.For completeness of the reasoning, note that we have proven that if the arrangement is possible, it looks exactly like this.

It is easy to compute if we take small absolute value integers, let x=0,1,2 and -2 (four equations are needed):begin{array}{r}A+B+D=1 6 A+3 B+4 C+4 D=1 21 A+7 B+18 C+9 D=1 -3 A+3 B-2 C+D=1end{array}Subtract from (8) four times (5), from (9) nine times (5), and from (10) (5):begin{array}{llr} & 2 A-B+4 C=-3 12 A-2 B+18 C=-8, & text { i.e., } & 6 A-B+9 C=-4 -4 A+2 B-2 C=0, & text { i.e., } & -2 A+B-C=0end{array}Add (13) to (11) and (12): 3 C=-3, so C=-1, and 4 A+8 C=4 A-8=-4, A=1, so from (13) B=C+2 A=1 and from (5) D=-1.Kövesi Gusztáv (Budapest, I. István g. II. o. t.) Faragó István (Budapest, Könyves Kálmán g. II. o. t.)II. Solution. If (1) holds, thenfrac{A}{x+1}+frac{C x+D}{x^{2}+x+1}=frac{1}{(x+1)^{2}left(x^{2}+x+1right)}-frac{B}{(x+1)^{2}}=frac{1-Bleft(x^{2}+x+1right)}{(x+1)^{2}left(x^{2}+x+1right)}For this to be true, the right side must become a polynomial when multiplied by (x+1)left(x^{2}+x+1right), or it must be simplifiable by x+1. The numerator can be factored into x+1 and another (first-degree) polynomial if its value is 0 when x=-1, since then the x+1 factor will be 0. Thus, 1-B cdot 1=0, B=1. Indeed, with this, the right side of (14) becomesfrac{-x(x+1)}{(x+1)^{2}left(x^{2}+x+1right)}=frac{-x}{(x+1)left(x^{2}+x+1right)}Similarly, moving the first term of (14) to the right side:frac{C x+D}{x^{2}+x+1}=frac{-x}{(x+1)left(x^{2}+x+1right)}-frac{A}{x+1}=frac{-x-Aleft(x^{2}+x+1right)}{(x+1)left(x^{2}+x+1right)}the numerator on the right side must also give 0 when x=-1, from which A=1. With this, (15) becomesfrac{C x+D}{x^{2}+x+1}=frac{-left(x^{2}+2 x+1right)}{(x+1)left(x^{2}+x+1right)}=frac{-x-1}{x^{2}+x+1}which holds for all permissible x if C=-1, D=-1.Remark. This solution also sheds light on the reason why it is possible to find suitable values for A, B, C, D.

We can set x=z c, y=z b, where (c, b)=1.Thus, the given equation transforms to z c+z^{2} b^{2}+z^{3}=z^{3} b cwhich simplifies to c+z b^{2}+z^{2}=z^{2} b c.Therefore, z mid c, meaning there exists an integer a such that c=z a, thus (1) further simplifies to a+b^{2}+z=z^{2} a b,or a=frac{b^{2}+z}{z^{2} b-1},(1) If z=1, thena=frac{b^{2}+1}{b-1}=b+1+frac{2}{b-1}.Thus, b-1 mid 2, so b=2 or 3. Correspondingly, a=5.x=z c=z(z a)=5.Therefore, the solutions are (x, y)=(5,2) or (5,3).(2) If z=2, then a=frac{b^{2}+2}{4 b-1},Thus, 16 a=frac{16 b^{2}+3^{2}}{4 b-1}=4 b+1+frac{33}{4 b-1},4 b-1 mid 33, so b=1 or 3. Correspondingly, a=1.x=z^{2} a=4 cdot y=z b=2 or 6.Therefore, the solutions are (x, y)=(4,2) or (4,6).(3) If z^{2} geqslant 3, thenz^{2} a=frac{z^{2} b^{2}+z^{3}}{z^{2} b-1}=b+frac{b+z^{3}}{z^{2} b-1}.Since x=z^{2} a is a positive integer, we must have frac{b+z^{3}}{z^{2} b-1} geqslant 1,which implies b leqslant frac{z^{2}-z+1}{z-1}.Since z geqslant 3, then frac{z^{2}-z+1}{z-1}<z+1,thus b<z+1, so b leqslant z.This leads to a=frac{b^{2}+z}{z^{2} b-1}<frac{z^{2}+z}{z^{2}-1}=1+frac{z+1}{z^{2}-1}<2.Therefore, a=1.From (2), we have 1+b^{2}+z=b z^{2},so b is an integer solution to the equation t^{2}-z^{2} t+z+1=0. Considering the discriminant z^{4}-4 z-4 must be a perfect square, butleft(z^{2}-1right)^{2}<z^{4}-4 z-4<z^{2},which means z^{4}-4 z-4 lies between two consecutive squares, and thus is not a square.Therefore, when z geqslant 3, the equation has no positive integer solutions.In summary, the solutions to the equation are(x, y)=(4,2),(4,6),(5,2),(5,3)."},{"problem":"5.

How many four-digit positive integers are increasing?(1 mark)","solution":"5. 40055. First we count the number of 'increasing' integers of the form mathrm{ABCA}. In this case mathrm{C} must be greater than mathrm{B}. For each choice of mathrm{A} (there are 9 choices, namely, 1,2, ldots, 9 ), there are C_{2}^{10}=45 choices for mathrm{B} and mathrm{C} (as we require mathrm{C} to be greater than mathrm{B} and we can choose among 0 to 9 ). So there are 9 times 45=405 'increasing' numbers of this form.Next we count the number of 'increasing' integers of the form mathrm{ABCD}, where mathrm{A} is different from mathrm{D}. In this case we need only require mathrm{D} to be greater than mathrm{A}, whereas mathrm{B} and mathrm{C} can be arbitrary. Clearly, mathrm{A} and mathrm{D} have to be non-zero. So there are C_{2}^{9}=36 ways to choose mathrm{A} and mathrm{D}, and 10^{2}=100 ways to choose mathrm{B} and mathrm{C}. Thus there are 36 times 100=3600 'increasing' numbers of this form.It follows that the answer is 405+3600=4005.Alternative SolutionClearly, an increasing number cannot end with 0. Consider all four-digit positive integers that do not end with 0. There are 9 times 10 times 10 times 9=8100 such numbers. Among these, 9 times 10=90 of them are palindromes (as all palindromes are of the form ABBA where mathrm{A} is from 1 to 9 while mathrm{B} is from 0 to 9). So 8100-90=8010 of them are not palindromes. By grouping an integer with its reverse (i.e. ABCD with DCBA), we get 8010 div 2=4005 pairs. In each pair, exactly one integer is increasing.

Among the factors of the number (1 times 2 times 3 times ldots times 99 times 100), 20 numbers are divisible by 5 ((100: 5=20)).Of these, 4 numbers are divisible by 25 ((20: 5=4)). Therefore, all fives appear as a factor 24 times. Among the factors of the number(1 times 2 times 3 times ldots times 99 times 100) there are 50 even numbers, so the factor 2 will appear 24 times for sure. Hence, the product ends with 24 zeros.Second method of solution (Anna Sonkina, 3a grade student of School No. 24).Let's factorize all composite numbers into prime factors. We need to find out how many fives are in the factorization. They are in the numbers 5, (10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, 55, 60, 65, 70, 75, 80, 85, 90, 95, 100). There are 10 multiples of 10; two numbers give two fives when factorized. These are 50 and 100. This results in 12 fives. There are also 10 numbers ending in 5, but two numbers give two fives when factorized. These are 25 and 75. This results in 12 fives. In total, there are 24 fives. There are more than 24 twos in the factorization. Therefore, the product ends with 24 zeros. The other numbers in the product do not contribute any zeros.Answer: 24 zeros."},{"problem":"Problem 1.

Rewritten in standard form, it becomes: x^2 - frac{y^2}{3} = 1. From this standard form, we can identify that the foci of the hyperbola are at (-2, 0) and (2, 0) because for a hyperbola in the form x^2/a^2 - y^2/b^2 = 1, the foci are at (pm asqrt{1 + b^2/a^2}, 0). From the given equation, a^2 = 1, and hence a = 1 (since a is positive by definition), so the eccentricity e = sqrt{1 + b^2/a^2} = sqrt{1 + 3} = 2.For the sought ellipse with the same foci, the eccentricity should be the reciprocal, i.e., e = 1/2. We denote the semi-major axis as a and the semi-minor axis as b (where a > b > 0), and start with the definition of eccentricity for an ellipse: e = frac{c}{a}, where c is the distance between the center of the ellipse and a focus.

Objective: We want to find the range of eccentricity e of the hyperbola given that the minimum value of frac{{|PF_{2}|^2}}{|PF_{1}|} is 8a.3. Substitution: Substituting |PF_2| = |PF_1| + 2a into frac{{|PF_{2}|^2}}{|PF_{1}|}, we get:[frac{{|PF_{2}|^2}}{|PF_{1}|} = frac{{(|PF_{1}| + 2a)^2}}{|PF_{1}|} = |PF_{1}| + 4a + frac{4a^2}{|PF_{1}|}.]4. Applying AM-GM Inequality: The expression |PF_{1}| + 4a + frac{4a^2}{|PF_{1}|} can be observed through the AM-GM inequality, which states that for non-negative x and y, we have sqrt{xy} leq frac{x + y}{2}, with equality if and only if x = y.

This circle is divided into l arcs by these l points, and each arc divides a closed region of the plane into two, or encloses a closed region from the infinite region (Figure 1). Therefore, the number of regions in the plane increases by l in the n-th step, while the number of intersection or tangency points of the circles increases by at most l, since among the l points of intersection or tangency created by the n-th circle with the previously drawn ones, there may be points that already belonged to at least two circles before the n-th step.In the first step, the single circle drawn divides the plane into two regions, and the number of points lying on at least two circles is 0. According to the above, the number of regions increases by at least as much as the number of intersection or tangency points of the circles in each step, so - after a total of k points lie on at least two circles - the number of regions created is at least k+2.Switching to the case m>1, if the i-th connected component (i=1,2, ldots, m) has k_{i} intersection or tangency points of the circles, then at least k_{i}+2 regions are created in this component (including the infinite region).

If b > 0, then x and y are positively correlated. Therefore, option A is incorrect because it misattributes the role of a in determining correlation.Option B: This option claims that if |r| is close to 0, it indicates a strong correlation between x and y. In reality, the correlation coefficient r measures the strength and direction of a linear relationship between two variables. A value of |r| close to 1 indicates a strong correlation, whether positive or negative, while a value close to 0 indicates a weak correlation. Thus, option B is incorrect because it misinterprets the meaning of the correlation coefficient's magnitude.Option C: Here, it's stated that if r > 0, then b > 0. The correlation coefficient r indicates the direction and strength of a linear relationship between two variables. If r > 0, it means there is a positive correlation between x and y.

While the regression equation hat{y} = bx + hat{a} does imply that a one-unit increase in x is associated with a b unit increase in the predicted value of y, this relationship is about estimated or expected changes, not guaranteed changes. The actual change in y for a specific one-unit increase in x can vary due to other factors not captured by the regression model.

This can be verified by direct calculation:   [   x_{n+1} = frac{a^{n+1} - 1}{b^{n+1} - 1}   ]   Since (a > b), it follows that (a^{n+1} - 1 > a^n - 1) and (b^{n+1} - 1 > b^n - 1), thus:   [   frac{a^{n+1} - 1}{b^{n+1} - 1} > frac{a^n - 1}{b^n - 1}   ]   Hence, (x_n < x_{n+1}).4.

We prove this by induction: for n=1 and n=2, this is easily verifiable. Suppose that for some n, there are 1 cdot 3 cdot 5 cdot ldots cdot(2 n-1) ways to place the weights. We need to show that for n+1 weights, there are (2 n+1) times as many ways as for n weights.Take any placement of the n weights. We create a placement for n+1 weights in the following way: double the mass of each element, and then insert an additional step where we place a weight of mass 1.Doubling the masses gives us the weights of masses 2, 4, ldots, 2^n, and we insert the weight of mass 1, so this is indeed a placement of n+1 weights. Doubling does not alter the order of magnitudes. Since the masses are even after doubling, the weight of mass 1 only ruins the placement if we insert it at the beginning and place it on the right side. Therefore, except for one case, we can place the weight of mass 1 on either side at any time, thus creating 2 n+1 placements for n+1 weights. It remains to show that every placement for n+1 weights can be reached this way and that no placement can be reached from two different placements of n weights.Every placement for n+1 weights can be reached, since we can also describe the method in reverse: take a placement for n+1 weights. Remove the step where the weight of mass 1 is placed, and divide the masses by 2. This gives us a placement for n weights from which the original placement for n+1 weights can be reached.If we start from different placements, the weights of masses 2, 4, ldots, 2^n will be in a different order in the placement for n+1 weights, meaning that each placement can only be reached in one way.We have created 2 n+1 placements for n+1 weights from each placement, thus proving the induction."},{"problem":"In triangle ABC, the sides opposite angles A, B, and C are denoted as a, b, and c, respectively.

In the bus, there are seats numbered from 1 to 52. Among them, the prime numbers are: 2,3,5,7,11,13,17,19,23,29,31, 37,41,43 and 47. From these numbers, we need to find one such that when added to its predecessors and successors, the sum is 54. With the numbers 2,3,5,7,11, 23,29,31,37,41,43 and 47, this cannot happen because the sum is either smaller or larger than 54. From the remaining three prime numbers 13, 17, 19, 54 can be obtained in the following two ways: 12+13+14+15 or 17+18+19 but in the second sum, there are two prime numbers. Therefore, the seats had the numbers 12,13,14 and 15, which means the teacher was accompanied by three students.Second method. Let k+1, k+2, ldots, n be the seat numbers where the teacher and students sat, k in mathbb{N}, n in mathbb{N} and n-k>1. Since the sum of these numbers is 54, we havebegin{aligned}& frac{n(n+1)}{2}-frac{k(k+1)}{2}=54 & n^{2}+n-k^{2}-k=108 & (n-k)(n+k)+(n-k)=108 & (n-k)(n+k+1)=108end{aligned}The number 108 can be factored as108=2 cdot 2 cdot 3 cdot 3 cdot 3, quad n-k>1, quad n+k+1>n-kso we have the following cases:| first: | n+k+1=54, | n-k=2 |  || :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- || second: | n+k+1=36, | n-k=3 | n=19, k=16 || third: | n+k+1=27, | n-k=4 | n=15, k=11 |fourth: quad n+k+1=18, quad n-k=6fifth: quad n+k+1=12, quad n-k=9 quad n=10, k=1From all cases, in the second and fifth cases, there are more prime numbers, so the third case remains according to which the seat numbers in the bus were: 12,13,14 and 15, which means the teacher was accompanied by three students."},{"problem":"Matilda counted the birds that visited her bird feeder yesterday.

The division can be done in two ways: either the beginning is a two-digit number and the end is a one-digit number, or vice versa.In the first case, according to the problem statement, the following equality holds:3(10a + b)c = 100a + 10b + cRearranging, we get:(10a + b)(3c - 10) = c3c - 10 neq 0, because c is an integer and 10a + b is definitely a two-digit number (a neq 0), so c cannot be 0. However, multiplying a two-digit number by a non-zero integer cannot result in a one-digit number. Therefore, there is no solution in this case.If, however, we divide the number such that the beginning is a one-digit number, we get the equation:3(10b + c)a = 100a + 10b + cFactoring, we get:(3a - 1)(10b + c) = 100aThis will only be an integer if 3a - 1 is a divisor of 100, since a and (3a - 1) have no common divisor greater than 1. It is easy to show that this only holds for a = 1, a = 2, and a = 7.If a = 1, then 10b + c = frac{100}{2} = 50, so b = 5 and c = 0. The three-digit number is 150, and indeed 50 cdot 3 cdot 1 = 150.If a = 2, then 10b + c = frac{200}{5} = 40, so b = 4 and c = 0.

For this group, there is no flavor represented by exactly 10 candies. Moreover, n-k geqslant n-frac{n}{10}=frac{9 n}{10}>frac{9 cdot 160}{10}=144. Thus, the considered group contains at least 145 candies, so the condition of the problem is not satisfied.Example. Now let us provide an example of a situation where Vasya can have 160 candies. Suppose he has exactly 10 candies of each of 16 flavors. Let a group be chosen for which there is no flavor represented by exactly 10 candies. Then this group does not include at least one candy of each flavor (in other words, no flavor is taken completely), i.e., the group contains no more than 16 cdot 9=144 candies, so the condition of the problem is satisfied.Remark 1. The estimate n leqslant 160 can also be proven in a slightly different way. Suppose that some n=145+m \\"works\\", i.e., there exists a set K_{0} of n candies that satisfies the condition of the problem. Then in the set K_{0} there are exactly 10 candies of some flavor A_{0}. Remove the candy a_{0} of flavor A_{0} and consider the group K_{1} of the remaining n-1 candies. In the group K_{1} there are exactly 10 candies of some flavor A_{1}, which is different from A_{0}, since K_{1} has exactly 9 candies of flavor A_{0}. Remove from K_{1} the candy a_{1} of flavor A_{1} and consider the group K_{2} of the remaining n-2 candies, in which we will find 10 candies of a new flavor A_{3}, and so on, continue to remove one candy at a time and consider the groups of remaining candies. Thus, we will reach the group K_{m}, consisting of left|K_{m}right|=145 candies. According to our algorithm, K_{0} contains 10 candies of flavors A_{0}, ldots, A_{m}, so left|K_{0}right| geqslant 10(m+1). We have 145+m geqslant 10(m+1), from which m leqslant 15 and n leqslant 160.Remark 2. The example for n=160 is unique.Comment. Points for the estimate and example are summed. There is only a correct answer without justifications - 0 points.There is a correct example for n=160 and justification that the condition of the problem is satisfied for this example - 3 points (in the case where a correct example is provided but the justification is missing, 1 point is deducted, i.e., 2 points are given instead of 3).There is a correct and complete proof of the estimate n leqslant 160- 4 points (if there are gaps in the proof of the estimate, points may be reduced to 3 or 2 points)."},{"problem":"Task 1.

Then in this case we have two subcases;x, y = 3,0: This case has tbinom{6}{3} cdot tbinom{6}{0} = 20 ways.x, y = 1,1: This case has tbinom{6}{1} cdot tbinom{6}{1} = 36 ways.In total, this case has 20+36=boxed{56} ways.textbf{Case 3: }S=6In this case, there are 4 subcases;x, y = 6,0: This case has tbinom{6}{6} cdot tbinom{6}{0} = 1 way.x, y = 4,1: This case has tbinom{6}{4} cdot tbinom{6}{1} = 90 ways.x, y = 2,2: This case has tbinom{6}{2} cdot tbinom{6}{2} = 225 ways.x, y = 0,3: This case has tbinom{6}{0} cdot tbinom{6}{3} = 20 ways.In total, this case has 1+90+225+20=boxed{336} ways.Note that for each case, the # of 1’s goes down by 2 and the # of 2’s goes up by 1. This is because the sum is fixed, so when we change one it must be balanced out by the other. This is similar to the Diophantine equation x + 2y= S and the total number of solutions will be tbinom{6}{x} cdot tbinom{6}{y}. From here we continue our casework, and our subcases will be coming out quickly as we have realized this relation.textbf{Case 4: }S=9In this case we have 3 subcases:x, y = 5,2: This case has tbinom{6}{5} cdot tbinom{6}{1} = 90 ways.x, y = 3,3: This case has tbinom{6}{3} cdot tbinom{6}{3} = 400 ways.x, y = 1,4: This case has tbinom{6}{1} cdot tbinom{6}{4} = 90 ways.In total, this case has 90+400+90=boxed{580} ways.textbf{Case 5: } S=12In this case we have 4 subcases:x, y = 6,3: This case has tbinom{6}{6} cdot tbinom{6}{3} = 20 ways.x, y = 4,4: This case has tbinom{6}{4} cdot tbinom{6}{4} = 225 ways.x, y = 2,5: This case has tbinom{6}{2} cdot tbinom{6}{5} = 90 ways.x, y = 0,6: This case has tbinom{6}{0} cdot tbinom{6}{6} = 1 way.Therefore the total number of ways in this case is 20 + 225 + 90 + 1=boxed{336}. Here we notice something interesting. Not only is the answer the same as Case 3, the subcases deliver the exact same answers, just in reverse order. Why is that?We discover the pattern that the values of x, y of each subcase of Case 5 can be obtained by subtracting the corresponding values of x, y of each subcase in Case 3 from 6 ( For example, the subcase 0, 6 in Case 5 corresponds to the subcase 6, 0 in Case 3). Then by the combinatorial identity, tbinom{6}{k} = tbinom{6}{6-k}, which is why each subcase evaluates to the same number. But can we extend this reasoning to all subcases to save time?Let’s write this proof formally. Let W_S be the number of subsets of the set {1,2,1,2,1,2,1,2,1,2,1,2} (where each 1 and 2 is distinguishable) such that the sum of the elements of the subset is S and S is divisible by 3. We define the empty set as having a sum of 0. We claim that W_S = W_{18-S}.W_S = sum_{i=1}^{|D|} tbinom{6}{x_i}tbinom{6}{y_i} if and only if there exists x_i, y_i that satisfy 0leq x_i leq 6, 0leq y_i leq 6, x_i + 2y_i = S, and D  is the set of the pairs x_i, y_i. This is because for each pair x_i, y_i there are six elements of the same residue mod(3) to choose x_i and y_i numbers from, and their value sum must be S.Let all x_n, y_n satisfy x_n = 6-x_i and y_n = 6-y_i.We can rewrite the equation x_i+ 2y_i = S implies -x_i- 2y_i = -S implies 6-x_i+ 6-2y_i= 12 - Simplies 6-x_i+12-2y_i = 18-S implies 6-x_i + 2(6-y_i) = 18-S[implies x_n + 2y_n = 18 - S]Therefore, since 0leq x_i, y_ileq 6 and x_n = 6-x_i and y_n = 6-y_i, 0leq x_n, y_nleq 6. As shown above, x_n + 2y_n = 18 - S and since S and 18 are divisible by 3, 18 -S is divisible by 3. Therefore, by the fact that W_S = sum_{i=1}^{|D|} tbinom{6}{x_i}tbinom{6}{y_i}, we have that;W_{18-S} = sum_{n=1}^{|D|} tbinom{6}{x_n}tbinom{6}{y_n} implies W_{18-S} =  sum_{i=1}^{|D|} tbinom{6}{6-x_i}tbinom{6}{6-y_i} implies W_{18-S} =  sum_{i=1}^{|D|} tbinom{6}{x_i}tbinom{6}{y_i} = W_S, proving our claim.We have found our shortcut, so instead of bashing out the remaining cases, we can use this symmetry. The total number of ways over all the cases is sum_{k=0}^{6} W_{3k} = 2 cdot (1+56+336)+580 = 1366. The final answer is frac{2^{6}cdot 1366}{2^{18}} = frac{1366}{2^{12}} = frac{683}{2^{11}}.There are no more 2’s left to factor out of the numerator, so we are done and the answer is boxed{boxed{683}}.~KingRavi"},{"problem":"The equation of the circle with center at point (-2, 3) and tangent to the y-axis is.","solution":"Given the problem, the radius r of the circle equals |-2| = 2.Therefore, the standard equation of the circle is (x + 2)^2 + (y - 3)^2 = 4.Hence, the answer is boxed{(x + 2)^2 + (y - 3)^2 = 4}."},{"problem":"Given frac {sinalpha-2cosalpha}{3sinalpha +5cosalpha } = 5, the value of tanalpha is (　　)A: -2B: 2C: -frac {27}{14}D: -frac {23}{16}","solution":"Since frac {sinalpha-2cosalpha}{3sinalpha +5cosalpha } = frac {tanalpha-2}{3tanalpha +5} = 5,Therefore, tanalpha = -frac {27}{14},Hence, the correct option is: boxed{C}.By utilizing the basic relationship of trigonometric functions of the same angle given by the condition, we can derive that frac {tanalpha-2}{3tanalpha +5} = 5, from which the value of tanalpha is obtained.This question mainly examines the basic relationship of trigonometric functions of the same angle and is considered a basic question."},{"problem":"8.

Which of these 88 flowers are more: sweet or bitter, and by how many?","solution":"Solution. Let among the 88 garden flowers, s be sweet and g be bitter. Then the number of flowers visited by two bees is exactly 88-s-g. On one hand, the total number of bee landings on the flowers is 3 cdot 54=162 (each bee visited 54 flowers), and on the other hand, it is 3s + 2(88-s-g) + g = s - g + 176. We have the equation 162 = s - g + 176, from which s - g = -14. This means that there are 14 more bitter flowers.

Since h(m) is decreasing on (0, ln 2) and increasing on (ln 2, 1), with h(0) = 0 and h(1) = e - 3  1, f(x) is decreasing on (-infty, 1) and increasing on (1, m].

Maximum 20 pointsThe commander of a tank battalion, in celebration of being awarded a new military rank, decided to organize a mass celebration, inviting subordinate soldiers.

However, after consulting with his family, the tank battalion commander decided to make a surprise - initially, guests, as well as the commander himself, will make decisions about consuming buckwheat porridge, assuming that they will pay for it themselves, but at the end of the celebration, the commander will pay the total bill from his family's savings. He discovered that if the soldiers are lined up by height, there is a certain pattern in the changes in their demand functions. The demand for buckwheat porridge of the shortest soldier is given by ( Q_d = 510 - 5.1P ), the next tallest ( Q_d = 520 - 5.2P ), the next ( Q_d = 530 - 5.3P ), and so on. The commander will first invite the shortest tankers. The individual demand of the commander for buckwheat porridge is given by ( Q_d = 500 - 5P ).(a) How is the individual demand of the 45th soldier invited to the celebration defined? How will the aggregate demand for buckwheat porridge be defined if the commander invites 45 soldiers and does not refuse the porridge himself?(b) The commander can invite the soldiers to a local cafe, the only one in the region. The marginal costs of producing buckwheat porridge are 0. The commander's family is willing to spend no more than 2,525,000 monetary units on the celebration. What is the maximum number of guests whose demand for buckwheat porridge will be satisfied at the celebration if the commander eats the porridge with everyone?(c) After estimating how many soldiers he can feed in the cafe, the battalion commander decided to invite the military personnel to a tank festival. In addition to the commander and the soldiers he invites, no one else demands porridge. Buckwheat porridge at the festival is offered by 25 perfectly competitive firms, each with a supply function ( Q_s = 302P ). The commander's family is willing to spend the entire amount allocated for the celebration, but if it is not enough, the commander will ask all guests to equally share the remaining bill. It is known that the equilibrium price was set at 20 monetary units. How many soldiers did the commander invite to the festival? Did the guests have to pay part of the bill? If so, how much did each of them pay? Assume that if the guests, like the commander, have to make a certain fixed payment, the payment does not affect their demand for buckwheat porridge.(d) Which option (b or c) would the soldiers prefer if each of them made a decision about the amount of buckwheat porridge to consume according to their demand function as described in the problem? Justify your answer.","solution":"# Solution(a) The commander tries to feed as many soldiers as possible, which means he will primarily invite relatively short soldiers - all other things being equal, their porridge consumption is less.Note that the individual demand of soldiers is determined by the formula Q_{d}=500+10 n-(5+0.1 n) P, where n is the ordinal number of the soldier. Also note that all consumers are willing to purchase the product at P in [0; 100], which means that to find the market demand, it is sufficient to sum the individual demand functions.The individual demand of the 45th soldier is Q_{d}=950-9.5 P. To find the demand of 45 soldiers, we can use the formula for the arithmetic progression:Q_{d}=frac{(510-5.1 P + 500 + 10 n - (5 + 0.1 n) P)}{2} cdot nIf n=45, then:Q_{d}=32850-328.5 PAdding the commander's demand, we get the market demand: Q_{d}=33350-333.5 P.Answer: Q_{d}=950-9.5 P, Q_{d}=33350-333.5 P.(b) For the canteen, the profit maximization problem coincides with the revenue maximization problem, since marginal costs are zero. If the commander invites n soldiers, then the market demand will be:Q_{d}=500-5 P + frac{1010 n + 10 n^2 - (10.1 n + 0.1 n^2) P}{2}Q_{d}=5 n^2 + 505 n + 500 - (0.05 n^2 + 5.05 n + 5) PT R=(5 n^2 + 505 n + 500) P - (0.05 n^2 + 5.05 n + 5) P^2The graph of T R is a parabola opening downwards, since for n geq 0 it holds that 0.05 n^2 + 5.05 n + 5 > 0.

For a linear demand function, C S=frac{(P_{max }-P_{e}) Q}{2}. The demand function of each soldier is linear, and P_{max }=100.In part (b), consumers do not pay for the buckwheat porridge, i.e., P_{e}=0.Q_{i}^{1}=500+10 i-(5+0.1 i) cdot 50=250+5 iC S_{i}^{1}=(P_{max }-P_{e}) cdot 0.5 cdot Q_{1}^{i}=(100-0) cdot 0.5(250+5 i)=12500+250 i.In part (c), consumers do not pay for the buckwheat porridge directly, but spend 3300 monetary units.Q_{i}^{2}=500+10 i-(5+0.1 i) cdot 20=400+8 iC S_{i}^{2}=(100-0) cdot 0.5(400+8 i)-3300=16700+400 iIt is clear that even with the expenses for partial payment of the bill, for any i geq 0 it holds that C S_{i}^{2}>C S_{i}^{1}.Answer: all soldiers prefer the option (c).## Grading Criteria(a) Individual demand is formulated - (1p), market demand is formulated - (2p).(b) The firm's problem is formulated - (1p), the optimal price is determined - (2p), the maximum number of guests is determined - (3p).(c) The market supply function is formulated - (1p), the equilibrium quantity is determined - (1p), the market demand function in terms of the number of guests is formulated - (2p), the maximum number of guests is determined - (2p), the behavior of guests and their payment of the bill is determined - (2p).(d) A justified comparison of benefits is formulated, from which a conclusion is drawn about the preference of a certain option - (3p).A penalty of 1 point for arithmetic errors that did not lead to significant distortion of the results.

Let's write down the possible pairs (y, z) in octal form:(overline{ldots a 1}, overline{ldots a 3}), quad(overline{ldots a 3}, overline{ldots a 5}), quad(overline{ldots a 5}, overline{ldots a 7}), quad(overline{ldots a 7}, overline{ldots(a+1) 1})For the first and third pairs, the last octal digit of x will be 3, and the second-to-last digit will be -4 a bmod 8 or (12 a+4) bmod 8. This digit is non-zero because the numbers in the progression are two-digit. Therefore, in both cases, it is 4, and the octal representation of x ends in 43. Considering the condition, x can take the values 3343_{8} or 13233343_{8}. The first number fits, sincex+1=3343_{8}+1=1764=42^{2} quad text { and } quad x=41 cdot 43 .Let x=13233343_{8}. Then(x+1) bmod 3=(12-10+1) bmod 3=0 quad text { and } quad(x+1) bmod 9=(12-10+1) bmod 9=3Thus, the number x+1 is divisible by 3 and not by 9, so it is not a perfect square.Now consider the second and fourth pairs in (*). The last octal digit of x will be 7, and the second-to-last digit will be 1 or 7. The first case cannot occur for n geqslant 2, since the number 17_{8}-8 is not two-digit. Therefore, considering the condition, the possible values of x are:6777_{8}, 576777_{8}, 47576777_{8}, 3747576777_{8}, 17273747576777_{8}Note that x+1=ldots 7000_{8}=ldots 78 cdot 2^{9}. Then the number x+1 is divisible by 2^{9} and not by 2^{10}, so it is not a perfect square. Therefore, x=3343_{8} is the only answer."},{"problem":"Given vectors overrightarrow{a} and overrightarrow{b} satisfy: |overrightarrow{a}|=1, |overrightarrow{b}|=1, and |overrightarrow{a} + overrightarrow{b}| = sqrt{3}, then the cosine of the angle between overrightarrow{a} and overrightarrow{a} + 2overrightarrow{b} is: ______.","solution":"Since |overrightarrow{a}|=1, |overrightarrow{b}|=1, and |overrightarrow{a} + overrightarrow{b}| = sqrt{3},we have (overrightarrow{a} + overrightarrow{b})^2 = overrightarrow{a}^2 + 2overrightarrow{a} cdot overrightarrow{b} + overrightarrow{b}^2 = 3.Substituting the given values, we get overrightarrow{a} cdot overrightarrow{b} = frac{1}{2}.Therefore, overrightarrow{a} cdot (overrightarrow{a} + 2overrightarrow{b}) = overrightarrow{a}^2 + 2overrightarrow{a} cdot overrightarrow{b} = 2,and |overrightarrow{a} + 2overrightarrow{b}| = sqrt{(overrightarrow{a} + 2overrightarrow{b})^2} = sqrt{overrightarrow{a}^2 + 4overrightarrow{a} cdot overrightarrow{b} + 4overrightarrow{b}^2} = sqrt{1 + 4 times frac{1}{2} + 4} = sqrt{7}.Therefore, the cosine of the angle between overrightarrow{a} and overrightarrow{a} + 2overrightarrow{b}, costheta = frac{overrightarrow{a} cdot (overrightarrow{a} + 2overrightarrow{b})}{|overrightarrow{a}||overrightarrow{a} + 2overrightarrow{b}|} = frac{2}{1 times sqrt{7}} = frac{2sqrt{7}}{7}.Hence, the answer is: boxed{frac{2sqrt{7}}{7}}.This problem examines the dot product and the angle between plane vectors, involving the application of the magnitude formula, and is considered a basic question."},{"problem":"4.

There are 4 choices for the recipient of each book, leading to a total of 4^5 different combinations.Next, we determine the number of distributions where each student receives at least one book. To ensure each student gets at least one book, we must prevent any student from getting no books at all. We can use the inclusion-exclusion principle to avoid overcounting the distributions that leave one or more students without a book.The idea is to calculate the total ways of distributions that leave out at least one student, and then subtract that from the total possible distributions:1. First, we calculate the number of ways to exclude one particular student and distribute all five books among the remaining three students. There are 3 choices for each of the 5 books, which gives 3^5 combinations.2. However, there are 4 students, so to exclude any of the students, we have 4 times 3^5 combinations.3. But this overcounts the distributions that exclude two students because such distributions are subtracted once for each student they exclude. Thus, we need to add back the number of ways to distribute the books among two students. There are 2^5 combinations for two students and binom{4}{2} ways to choose which two students get the books. So, we add binom{4}{2} times 2^5.4.

In the future, we will only consider such sets. Similarly, if we replace the numbers x_{i} with 1-x_{i}, then y_{i} will be replaced with 1-y_{i}.

First, consider the case n=0:x^{3}+y^{3}=1Since the sum or difference of two positive cubes cannot be 1, and the same applies to two negative cubes, one of x and y must be zero, and the other must be 1=2^{0}.Now let's consider the inductive step: assume that the equation x^{3}+y^{3}=8^{n} has only the two solutions mentioned above, and examine the equation x^{3}+y^{3}=8^{n+1}. It is clear that x and y must have the same parity, since the sum of their cubes is even. If both are even, then x=2 x^{prime}, y=2 y^{prime}, and thus 8^{n+1}=8 x^{prime^{3}}+8{y^{prime 3}}^{prime 3}, which simplifies to 8^{n}=x^{prime^{3}}+y^{prime 3}. By the induction hypothesis, left(x^{prime}, y^{prime}right)=left(0,2^{n}right) or left(2^{n}, 0right), and thus (x, y)=left(0,2^{n+1}right) or left(2^{n+1}, 0right).We will show that the other case is not possible, i.e., both cannot be odd. We will use an indirect proof: assume that x and y are indeed odd. Thenx^{3}+y^{3}=(x+y)left(x^{2}-x y+y^{2}right)=8^{n+1}=2^{3 n+3}Here, x^{2}-x y+y^{2} is odd and a divisor of 2^{3 n+3}, so it can only be pm 1.First, consider the system of equations x+y=8^{n+1}, x^{2}-x y+y^{2}=1. Since x and y are odd, they cannot be equal. Therefore, we can assume that x>y. This implies that x>0. From this, we get x^{2}>x y, and then x^{2}-x y+y^{2}>y^{2} geq 1, which is a contradiction.The only remaining case is the system of equations x+y=-8^{n+1}, x^{2}-x y+y^{2}=-1. However, x^{2}-x y+y^{2}=left(x-frac{y}{2}right)^{2}+frac{3}{4} y^{2} geq 0, so this system also has no solution.This completes the proof of our statement; in the special case n=30, the solutions are left(2^{30}, 0right) and left(0,2^{30}right).Based on the work of Gergely Bérczi (Szeged, Ságvári E. Gymnasium, 2nd year)Note. Our general problem is a special case of the equation appearing in Fermat's theorem:x^{3}+y^{3}=left(2^{n}right)^{3} text {. }Fermat's theorem (or its special case for third powers, which was already proven in Euler's time) states that this equation has no solution in positive integers. Therefore, the case x, y<0 is also impossible, as is the case x<0<y: rewriting the equation asy^{3}=left(2^{n}right)^{3}+(-x)^{3}we see that all numbers are positive, and thus this has no solution.

When the hundredth passenger sits down, only one seat can be free (99 have already sat down), and this seat can only be the hundredth or the first seat. Indeed, suppose that the seat of the X-th passenger would be free in between, then X would have sat in their seat. Thus, the last remaining seat can only be the first or the hundredth passenger's seat.Whether the first or the hundredth seat is free, it would have been free all along, even when the other one was taken. For example, if the \\"U\\" passenger sat in the first seat, either because they were the first passenger or because their seat was taken, they had an equal chance of sitting in the hundredth seat, and this would not have affected the seat selection of the subsequent passengers, as it made no difference to them whether the first or the hundredth seat was taken earlier.Similarly, if \\"U\\" sat in the hundredth seat, they had an equal chance of sitting in the first seat, regardless of the passengers who had already taken seats, and their decision would not have affected the subsequent arriving passengers. The probability of the two scenarios is the same.

Let's explore the given equation step-by-step: 1. Rewrite the given equation by applying the Law of Sines: bcos(C) + left( frac{bsin(B)}{sin(C)}right) cos(B) = 2b2. Factor out b on the left side of the equation:b(cos(C) + frac{sin(B)cos(B)}{sin(C)}) = 2b3. Cancel out b from both sides (assuming b neq 0):cos(C) + frac{sin(B)cos(B)}{sin(C)} = 24. Using the sum-to-product identities, rewrite cos(C) as sin(A) and simplify:sin(A) + sin(B)cot(B) = 25. Since cot(B) = frac{cos(B)}{sin(B)}, we can simplify the previous expression:sin(A) + cos(B) = 26. Recognize that sin(A) = sin(pi - B - C) and apply the sine subtraction identity:sin(B + C) + cos(B) = 27. Knowing that sin(B + C) = sin(A), the equation simplifies to:sin(A) + cos(B) = 28. By inspection, one solution is sin(A) = 1 and cos(B) = 1, which corresponds to A = 90^circ and B = 0^circ, which is not possible for a triangle.We can rewrite the original equation to form a sum-to-product identity:sin(B)cos(C) + cos(B)sin(C) = 2sin(B)Applying the sum of angles identity for sine, we have:sin(B + C) = 2sin(B)And knowing that sin(B + C) = sin(A), we obtain:sin(A) = 2sin(B)As we use the Law of Sines again, we find that:frac{a}{sin(A)} = frac{b}{sin(B)}Substitute sin(A) with 2sin(B):frac{a}{2sin(B)} = frac{b}{sin(B)}Cross-multiply to solve for a:a = 2bTherefore, the ratio of a to b is:frac{a}{b} = 2So we have our answer:boxed{frac{a}{b} = 2}"},{"problem":"11.

Let ( m ) and ( n ) be co-prime integers, with ( m ) even and ( n ) odd. We need to prove that the expression    [   frac{1}{2n} + sum_{k=1}^{n-1} (-1)^{leftlfloor frac{mk}{n} rightrfloor} left{ frac{mk}{n} right}   ]   does not depend on the values of ( m ) and ( n ).2. First, recall that ( leftlfloor x rightrfloor ) denotes the floor function, which gives the greatest integer less than or equal to ( x ), and ( left{ x right} ) denotes the fractional part of ( x ), which is ( x - leftlfloor x rightrfloor ).3. Since ( m ) and ( n ) are co-prime, the set ( { mk mod n mid k = 1, 2, ldots, n-1 } ) forms a complete residue system modulo ( n ). This means that as ( k ) ranges from ( 1 ) to ( n-1 ), ( mk mod n ) takes on every integer value from ( 1 ) to ( n-1 ) exactly once.4. Consider the term ( leftlfloor frac{mk}{n} rightrfloor ). Since ( m ) is even and ( n ) is odd, ( frac{mk}{n} ) can be written as ( frac{mk mod n}{n} + leftlfloor frac{mk}{n} rightrfloor ). The term ( leftlfloor frac{mk}{n} rightrfloor ) will be an integer that depends on the value of ( k ).5. We can rewrite the sum as:   [   sum_{k=1}^{n-1} (-1)^{leftlfloor frac{mk}{n} rightrfloor} left{ frac{mk}{n} right} = sum_{k=1}^{n-1} (-1)^{leftlfloor frac{mk}{n} rightrfloor} left( frac{mk mod n}{n} right)   ]6. Since ( mk mod n ) takes on every integer value from ( 1 ) to ( n-1 ) exactly once, we can replace ( mk mod n ) with ( j ) where ( j ) ranges from ( 1 ) to ( n-1 ). Thus, the sum becomes:   [   sum_{j=1}^{n-1} (-1)^{leftlfloor frac{mj}{n} rightrfloor} left( frac{j}{n} right)   ]7. Notice that ( leftlfloor frac{mj}{n} rightrfloor ) will be ( 0 ) or ( 1 ) depending on whether ( frac{mj}{n} ) is less than or greater than ( 1 ). Since ( m ) is even and ( n ) is odd, ( leftlfloor frac{mj}{n} rightrfloor ) will alternate between ( 0 ) and ( 1 ) as ( j ) ranges from ( 1 ) to ( n-1 ).8. Therefore, the sum can be split into two parts: one where ( leftlfloor frac{mj}{n} rightrfloor ) is ( 0 ) and one where it is ( 1 ). Each part will contribute equally to the sum, but with opposite signs:   [   sum_{j=1}^{n-1} (-1)^{leftlfloor frac{mj}{n} rightrfloor} left( frac{j}{n} right) = sum_{j=1}^{frac{n-1}{2}} left( frac{j}{n} right) - sum_{j=frac{n+1}{2}}^{n-1} left( frac{j}{n} right)   ]9. Each of these sums is equal to ( frac{n-1}{2n} ), so the total sum is:   [   sum_{j=1}^{n-1} (-1)^{leftlfloor frac{mj}{n} rightrfloor} left( frac{j}{n} right) = frac{n-1}{2n}   ]10. Adding the term ( frac{1}{2n} ) to this sum, we get:    [    frac{1}{2n} + frac{n-1}{2n} = frac{n}{2n} = frac{1}{2}    ]Thus, the expression does not depend on the values of ( m ) and ( n ) and is always equal to ( frac{1}{2} ).The final answer is ( boxed{ frac{1}{2} } )"},{"problem":"Given that the area of △ABC is S, and | overrightarrow {BC}|^{2} = overrightarrow {CA} • overrightarrow {CB} + 2S, determine the value of ∠B.","solution":"We know that S = frac {1}{2} | overrightarrow {CA}| | overrightarrow {CB}| sin C, and overrightarrow {CA} • overrightarrow {CB} = | overrightarrow {CA}| | overrightarrow {CB}| cos C.Given that | overrightarrow {BC}|^{2} = overrightarrow {CA} • overrightarrow {CB} + 2S, we can substitute the known expressions to obtain:| overrightarrow {BC}|^{2} = | overrightarrow {CA}| | overrightarrow {CB}| cos C + | overrightarrow {CA}| | overrightarrow {CB}| sin CTaking the square root of both sides, we have:| overrightarrow {BC}| = | overrightarrow {CA}| cos C + | overrightarrow {CA}| sin CNow, using the sine law, we have:sin A = sin B cos C + sin B sin CTherefore,sin (B + C) = sin B cos C + sin B sin CExpanding the left side of the equation using the sine sum formula, we obtain:sin B cos C + cos B sin C = sin B cos C + sin B sin CComparing both sides of the equation, we deduce that:cos B sin C = sin B sin CSince sin C > 0, we can simplify the expression to:cos B = sin BThus,tan B = 1Considering the range of B (0 < B < pi), we find that:B = boxed{frac{pi}{4}}"},{"problem":"If a=(-2)^{2}, b=(-2)^{0}, c=(-2)^{-2}, then the smallest among a, b, and c is:A: aB: bC: cD: Cannot be determined","solution":"To find the smallest among a, b, and c, we first calculate each of them:1.

Therefore, we can conclude f(0) = 0, which implies S_n = 2a_n - n.For n=1, we have a_1 = S_1 = 2a_1 - 1, which gives a_1 = 1.When n geqslant 2, we have S_{n-1} = 2a_{n-1} - (n-1), and a_n = S_n - S_{n-1} = 2a_n - n - 2a_{n-1} + (n-1). Simplifying this, we get a_n = 2a_{n-1} + 1. This means a_n + 1 = 2(a_{n-1} + 1).Therefore, the sequence {a_n + 1} is a geometric sequence with the first term being 2 and the common ratio also 2. We can deduce that a_n + 1 = 2^n, which means a_n = 2^n - 1.The inequality frac{lambda}{n} geqslant frac{n+1}{a_n + 1} holds for any n in mathbb{N}^*, which is equivalent to lambda geqslant frac{n(n+1)}{2^n} for any n in mathbb{N}^*.Let g(n) = frac{n(n+1)}{2^n}, then g(n+1) = frac{(n+1)(n+2)}{2^{n+1}}.Calculating g(n+1) - g(n) = frac{(1+n)(2-n)}{2^{n+1}}, we find that for n=1, 2, g(1) < g(2) = g(3), and for n geqslant 3, g(n+1) < g(n).This means g(n) is decreasing, so g(n) leqslant g(3) = g(2), and the maximum value of g(2) is frac{3}{2}.Therefore, lambda geqslant frac{3}{2}. The minimum value of the real number lambda is boxed{frac{3}{2}}.Hence, the correct answer is: boxed{C}.This problem examines the solution to the problem of inequalities always holding true, focusing on the transformation of ideas and finding the maximum value.

Similarly, this teacher cannot select any of the last three students; the remaining no more than one teacher also cannot select any of the last three students, leading to a contradiction.Below is the proof: For any distinct ordered sequence of real numbers a_{1}, a_{2}, cdots, a_{m}, when m geqslant 5, there must exist three numbers a_{i}, a_{j}, a_{k}(i<a_{j}>a_{k}.Let the maximum and minimum numbers be a_{s} and a_{t}. Without loss of generality, assume s<a_{s+1}>a_{t} ; s+1=t.Since m geqslant 5, there must be at least two numbers either before a_{s}, a_{s+1} or after a_{s}, a_{s+1}.Without loss of generality, assume there are two numbers a_{s+2} and a_{s+3} after a_{s}, a_{s+1}. Thus,a_{s}>a_{s+2}>a_{s+3} text { or } a_{s+1}<a_{s+2}<a_{s+3}must hold.Using the above conclusion, when n=4, the first teacher can select at least 3 students; if the remaining students are greater than or equal to 5, the second teacher can also select at least 3 students; at this point, the number of remaining students does not exceed 4, and can be selected by the two teachers.Therefore, the minimum value of n is 4."},{"problem":"2.7.

This function represents a quarter of a circle with center at (1, 0) and radius r = 1. Thus, the integral ∫_{ 0 }^{ 1 }sqrt {1-(x-1)^{2}}dx is equal to the area of this quarter circle:∫_{ 0 }^{ 1 }sqrt {1-(x-1)^{2}}dx = frac {1}{4}×π×1^{2}= frac {π}{4}.For the second integral, we have:∫_{ 0 }^{ 1 }xdx = frac {1}{2}x^{2} |_{ 0 }^{ 1 } = frac {1}{2}.Combining these results, we have:∫_{ 0 }^{ 1 }(sqrt {1-(x-1)^{2}}-x)dx = ∫_{ 0 }^{ 1 }sqrt {1-(x-1)^{2}}dx - ∫_{ 0 }^{ 1 }xdx = frac {π}{4} - frac {1}{2}.Therefore, the answer is boxed{frac {π}{4} - frac {1}{2}}."},{"problem":"7.

Therefore, when transitioning from a_{k} to a_{k+2}, (k-1)/2 last seats from the row with number k, the (k+1)-th seat from the row with number k+1, and (k+1)/2 first seats from the row with number k+2 are added.Thus, a_{k+2}=a_{k}+(k-1)/2+(k+1)+(k+1)/2+1=a_{k}+2(k+1).a_{1}=1a_{3}=a_{1}+2 cdot 2=1+4a_{5}=a_{3}+2 cdot 4=1+4+8a_{7}=a_{3}+2 cdot 6=1+4+8+12cdotsa_{k}=1+4+8+12+ldots+2(k-1)=1+4(1+2+ldots+(k-1)/2)=1+(k+1)(k-1)/2,Using this formula, we will find the row number where the best seat is located.begin{gathered}1+(k+1)(k-1) / 2=265 left(k^{2}-1right) / 2=264 k^{2}=264 cdot 2+1=529 k=sqrt{529}=23 .end{gathered}The total number of rows is 2 k-1 (before and after the row with the best seat, there are k-1 rows each).

Thus, the function h(x) must have a zero in the interval [0, 1],  and since (x-1)^2 and -2^x are both monotonically decreasing in the interval [0, 1],  h(x) is monotonically decreasing in the interval [0, 1],  therefore, h(x) has a unique zero in the interval [0, 1].

To find the asymptotic behavior of this count, we use a standard argument from the geometry of numbers, specifically Gauss's circle problem generalized to ellipsoids. The number of lattice points inside a region grows proportionally to the volume of that region.3. Consider the ellipsoid defined by (2x^2 + 3y^2 + 5z^2 leq R).

If one of the children ate a candies, then according to the condition, all the others ate a+11 candies, and thus all together ate S=a+(a+11)=2a+11 candies. This reasoning is valid for each child, so all the children ate the same number of candies: a=(S-11)/2 each.Now let N be the number of children. Then the condition can be written as a=a cdot (N-1)-11, from which 11=a cdot (N-2). The number 11 is prime, so one of the factors is 1, and the other is 11. But by the condition a>1, so a=11, N-2=1.

Let's consider the case where all ( a_i )'s are either 1 or -1. This simplifies the problem because the sums ( S_k ) will be easier to compute.5.

Find, with proof, the maximum possible value of alceil blambda rceil - b lfloor a lambda rfloor for irrational lambda.","solution":"1. Claim: The maximum possible value of ( a lceil blambda rceil - b lfloor alambda rfloor ) for irrational (lambda) is ( a + b - gcd(a, b) ).2. Step 1: Show that no greater value can be achieved.   - Note that ( a lceil blambda rceil - b lfloor alambda rfloor ) must be an integer because the floor and ceiling functions return integers.   - Since (gcd(a, b)) divides both (a) and (b), the value must be divisible by (gcd(a, b)).   - Since (lambda) is irrational, (blambda) and (alambda) are not integers. This implies (lceil blambda rceil = lfloor blambda rfloor + 1) and similarly for (alambda).3. Step 2: Use the fractional part notation.   - Define ({x}) as the fractional part of (x), so ({x} = x - lfloor x rfloor).   - Rearrange the definitions: (lfloor x rfloor = x - {x}) and (lceil x rceil = x + 1 - {x}) if (x) is not an integer.   - Substitute these into the expression:     [     a lceil blambda rceil - b lfloor alambda rfloor = a(blambda + 1 - {blambda}) - b(alambda - {alambda})     ]     [     = ablambda + a - a{blambda} - ablambda + b{alambda}     ]     [     = a - a{blambda} + b{alambda}     ]4. Step 3: Maximize the expression.   - To maximize (a - a{blambda} + b{alambda}), minimize (a{blambda}) and maximize (b{alambda}).   - The range of (f(x) = {x}) is ([0, 1)). Thus:     [     a - a{blambda} + b{alambda} < a - a cdot 0 + b cdot 1 = a + b     ]   - Therefore, (a - a{blambda} + b{alambda}) cannot be equal to (a + b). The largest multiple of (gcd(a, b)) below (a + b) is (a + b - gcd(a, b)).5. Step 4: Show that the value (a + b - gcd(a, b)) is achievable.   - Consider (c = frac{a}{gcd(a, b)}) and (d = frac{b}{gcd(a, b)}). This is equivalent to dividing (a lceil blambda rceil - b lfloor alambda rfloor) by (gcd(a, b)).   - We need to show:     [     c lceil dlambda rceil - d lfloor clambda rfloor = c + d - 1     ]     for some irrational (lambda).6. Step 5: Repeat the steps with (c) and (d).   - We have:     [     c lceil dlambda rceil - d lfloor clambda rfloor = c - c{dlambda} + d{clambda}     ]     [     c - c{dlambda} + d{clambda} = c + d - 1 implies d{clambda} - c{dlambda} = d - 1     ]   - For this to be true, ({clambda} ge frac{d-1}{d}) and (c{dlambda} < 1).7. Step 6: Find (lambda) that satisfies the inequalities.   - Consider the intervals:     [     frac{d-1}{d} le {clambda} < 1 implies clambda in left[frac{d-1}{d}, 1right) cup left[frac{2d-1}{d}, 2right) cup cdots     ]     [     0 le {dlambda} < frac{1}{c} implies dlambda in left[0, frac{1}{c}right) cup left[1, frac{c+1}{c}right) cup cdots     ]   - Multiply both results by (cd):     [     cdlambda in left(d-1, dright] cup left(2d-1, 2dright] cup cdots     ]     [     cdlambda in left[0, 1right) cup left[c, c+1right) cup cdots     ]8. Step 7: Find a common interval.   - Find values (i) and (j) such that (ic + 1 = jd). By Bezout's identity, there exist (i) and (j) such that (jd - ic = 1).   - Choose (lambda) such that (cdlambda = jd - epsilon) where (epsilon) is very small.Thus, we have proven that it is possible to choose a value of (lambda) such that (a lceil blambda rceil - b lfloor alambda rfloor = a + b - gcd(a, b)).

Determine all such triples of numbers.","solution":"By adding 1 to the equation, the right side can be factored as a product:n^{2}+1=left(p^{2}+1right)left(q^{2}+1right)If both p and q are odd, then this product is divisible by four, thus n^{2}=4 k-1. However, a square number divided by four can only give a remainder of zero or one, so at least one of p and q must be even, and since they are prime, it must be equal to two. Since the roles of p and q are interchangeable, we can assume that p=2.Then the equation becomes: n^{2}=4+5 q^{2}, or (n-2)(n+2)=5 q^{2}. The factorizations of the right side can only be left(1,5 q^{2}right), (q, 5 q), and left(q^{2}, 5right), since q is prime and n is a natural number. The larger element of these pairs must equal n+2, while the other must equal n-2, so their difference is 4:5 q^{2}-1=4, quad text { or } quad 5 q-q=4, quad text { or } quad q^{2}-5= pm 4From the first, q^{2}=1, which is not prime; from the second, q=1, also not prime; from the third, q^{2}=9 or 1, of which the only prime solution is q=3. Substituting this back in:p^{2}+q^{2}+p^{2} q^{2}=4+9+4 cdot 9=49=7^{2}Thus, in this case, p=2, q=3, n=7 is the only solution. Adding to this the triplet obtained by swapping p and q, p=3, q=2, n=7, we get all the solutions to the equation.Based on the work of Tímea Lengyel (Kaposvár, Munkácsy M.
