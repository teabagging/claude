First, let's find the distribution law of the given discrete random variable X. This variable can take three values: x_{1}=0, x_{2}=1, x_{3}=2.We introduce the notation: event A_{1} - \\"the first shooter hits\\", event A_{2} - \\"the second shooter hits\\", then bar{A}_{1} and bar{A}_{2} are their respective misses. From the problem statement, it follows thatbegin{aligned}& q_{1}=Pleft(overline{A_{1}}right)=1-p_{1}=0.5 & q_{2}=Pleft(bar{A}_{2}right)=1-p_{2}=0.6end{aligned}The value x_{1}=0 corresponds to the case when both shooters miss - the event A=bar{A}_{1} bar{A}_{2}, where bar{A}_{1} and bar{A}_{2} are independent events since A_{1} and A_{2} are independent.By the multiplication theorem, we getP(A)=Pleft(bar{A}_{1}right) cdot Pleft(bar{A}_{2}right)=0.5 cdot 0.6=0.3The value x_{2}=1 corresponds to the case when the number of hits is one: the first shooter hits and the second misses, or the second hits and the first misses. This means that the eventB=A_{1} bar{A}_{2}+A_{2} bar{A}_{1}occurred, where A_{1} bar{A}_{2} and A_{2} bar{A}_{1} are mutually exclusive events, and A_{1} and bar{A}_{2}, A_{2} and bar{A}_{1} are independent events, respectively.

Suppose there exists some x such that f(x) > 1. For this x, we can find a positive y such that y f(x) = x + y; this number is y = frac{x}{f(x) - 1}. Substituting these values into (1),f(x) f(x+y) = f(x) f(y f(x)) = f(x+y)from which it follows that f(x) = 1, which is a contradiction.In equation (1), the factor f(y f(x)) is always at most 1; this implies that for any x, y, f(x+y) leq f(x), meaning that the function f is monotonically decreasing.Now we show that the function is either constantly 1 or all its values are less than 1. If for some x > 0, f(x) = 1, then from the equation f(2x) = f(x + x) = f(x) f(x f(x)) = 1. Repeating this step, we get that f(4x), f(8x), etc., are all 1. By monotonicity, the function value must also be 1 at points smaller than these. Therefore, if the function takes the value 1 at least once, it is constantly 1.The constant 1 function satisfies the functional equation (1). In the following, we consider the case where f takes values less than 1 everywhere. For such functions, we obtain by the previous method that they are strictly monotonically decreasing and thus bijective.Let f(1) = a; for any t > 0, substitute into (1) the numbers x = 1, y = frac{t}{a}, and x = t, y = 1 + frac{1-a}{a} t; their sums are equal, so using (1):begin{gathered}f(1) f(t) = f(1) fleft(frac{t}{a} f(1)right) = fleft(1 + frac{t}{a}right) = = fleft(t + left(1 + frac{1-a}{a} tright)right) = f(t) fleft(left(1 + frac{1-a}{a} tright) f(t)right)end{gathered}Dividing by f(t), we getf(1) = fleft(left(1 + frac{1-a}{a} tright) f(t)right)and since f is bijective,1 = left(1 + frac{1-a}{a} tright) f(t)from whichf(t) = frac{1}{1 + frac{1-a}{a} t}Introducing the notation b = frac{1-a}{a}, we have f(t) = frac{1}{1 + b t}, where b > 0.

Let's denote the roots of this quadratic equation as r_1 and r_2, with r_1  2.   To find the exact values of a and b, we use the given transformations which are derived from Vieta's formulas. Vieta's formulas relate the coefficients of a polynomial to sums and products of its roots. Specifically, for a quadratic equation ax^2 + bx + c = 0 with roots r_1 and r_2, we have:   - r_1 + r_2 = -frac{b}{a}   - r_1 cdot r_2 = frac{c}{a}   Given left{begin{array}{c}-frac{b}{a}=3 frac{-1}{a}=2end{array}right., we can solve these equations for a and b:   - From frac{-1}{a} = 2 Rightarrow a = -frac{1}{2}   - Substituting a into -frac{b}{a} = 3 Rightarrow -frac{b}{-frac{1}{2}} = 3 Rightarrow b = frac{3}{2}2.

Solving (frac{x}{2}-1)(frac{3}{2}x-1) lt 0, we find the critical points to be frac{2}{3} and 2 by setting each factor to zero. This gives us the intervals to test within the inequality.

Since each digit is either 3 or 7, we need to consider the possible sums of the digits:   - If all digits are 3, the sum is (7 times 3 = 21), which is divisible by 3.   - If there are four 3s and three 7s, the sum is (4 times 3 + 3 times 7 = 12 + 21 = 33), which is divisible by 3.   - If there is one 3 and six 7s, the sum is (1 times 3 + 6 times 7 = 3 + 42 = 45), which is divisible by 3.2.

The cheapest transportation is for the second type of boxes, followed by the third type, and the most expensive is the first type.

Initial Observations and Bounds:   - Since (a^p - b^p = 2013) and (a > b), we start by considering small values of (a) and (b) to bound (p).   - For ((a, b) = (3, 2)), we have (3^p - 2^p).

The probability is calculated similarly, considering the different cases:P(X=3) = frac{2}{5} times frac{{C}_{3}^{1}{C}_{3}^{1}}{{C}_{6}^{2}} + frac{2}{5} times frac{{C}_{2}^{1}{C}_{4}^{1}}{{C}_{6}^{2}} + frac{1}{5} times frac{{C}_{2}^{1}{C}_{4}^{1}}{{C}_{6}^{2}} = frac{14}{25}- P(X=1): This occurs if no red balls are drawn from box B. The probability is calculated by considering the cases:P(X=1) = frac{2}{5} times frac{{C}_{3}^{2}}{{C}_{6}^{2}} + frac{2}{5} times frac{{C}_{4}^{2}}{{C}_{6}^{2}} + frac{1}{5} times frac{{C}_{4}^{2}}{{C}_{6}^{2}} = frac{8}{25}Therefore, the distribution of X is:| X | 1 | 3 | 5 ||-----|-----|-----|-----|| P | frac{8}{25} | frac{14}{25} | frac{3}{25} |# Part 2(ii):Given the distribution of X, the expected value E(X) is calculated as:E(X) = 5 times frac{3}{25} + 3 times frac{14}{25} + 1 times frac{8}{25} = frac{13}{5}Since Player A participates in 5 rounds of the game and the results of each round are independent, the expected total score Y obtained by Player A in 5 rounds is:E(Y) = 5E(X) = 5 times frac{13}{5} = 13Therefore, the expected total score obtained by Player A in 5 rounds is boxed{13}."},{"problem":"1 Find all positive integers n, such thatn^{4}-4 n^{3}+22 n^{2}-36 n+18is a perfect square.(Provided by Chengcheng)","solution":"We denotebegin{aligned}A & =n^{4}-4 n^{3}+22 n^{2}-36 n+18 & =left(n^{2}-2 nright)^{2}+18left(n^{2}-2 nright)+18 .end{aligned}Let ( n^{2}-2 n=x ) and ( A=y^{2} ), where ( y ) is a non-negative integer, then(x+9)^{2}-63=y^{2},which simplifies to(x+9-y)(x+9+y)=63.It follows that the only possible pairs ((x+9-y, x+9+y)) are ((1,63)), ((3,21)), or ((7,9)).

From both estimates, we get 3 leqq y<8, so |y-9|=9-y.

From equation (1), we get |x-5|=y-3, which, due to the restriction y<8, gives |x-5|<5 or 0<x<10. To eliminate the absolute values in the new system of equations, we only distinguish three cases.a) 0<x<3. In this case, from (1) we get y=8-x. Substituting into (2) gives9-x^{2}+(8-x)^{2}-5=52or x=1. The corresponding y=8-x=7 satisfies both initial constraints 3 leqq y<8.b) 3 leqq x<5. In this case, from (1) we also get y=8-x, but substituting into (2) givesx^{2}-9+(8-x)^{2}-5=52,which, after simplification, gives the quadratic equation x^{2}-8 x-1=0. We easily verify that this equation has no root satisfying the condition 3 leqq x<5.c) 5 leqq x<10. In this case, from (1) we get y=x-2.

This equation has two real roots 1 pm 4 sqrt{2}, of which only the root x=1+4 sqrt{2} satisfies the condition 5 leqq x<10.

Let us emphasize that in the solution, we replaced the derived condition y leqq sqrt{57} with the weaker inequality y<8 only for the simplicity of subsequent notations.

The vertices of this triangle are determined by the intersections of the lines x=20, y=20, and x+y=60, which form a right-angled triangle with legs of length 40cm each (since from x+y=60 and considering the minimum values for x and y being 20, we subtract 20 from both sides to get x+y-40=20, indicating the length of the legs).The area representing the event that the length of each segment is not less than 20cm is calculated by the area of this triangle, which is frac{1}{2} times 40 times 40 = 800 square centimeters.The total possible area, representing the sample space, is calculated by considering the maximum lengths x and y can take without the restriction of the third segment, which is a triangle formed by x=80, y=80, and x+y=80. This area is frac{1}{2} times 80 times 80 = 3200 square centimeters.Therefore, the probability that the length of each segment is not less than 20cm is the ratio of these two areas, which is frac{800}{3200} = frac{1}{4}.However, there seems to be a discrepancy in the calculation of the area representing the event. The correct calculation should be as follows: The area representing the event that the length of each segment is not less than 20cm is actually frac{1}{2} times 20 times 20 = 200 square centimeters (considering the correct interpretation of the constraints and the resulting triangle).Thus, the probability is correctly calculated as frac{200}{3200} = frac{1}{16}.Therefore, the correct answer is boxed{A}."},{"problem":"\\"Come, Juci, hurry to the market,Fresh eggs gleam white in your basket.Life is precious now... if you give wisely:You'll get a crown for them, indeed, six of them!\\"Said the lady.

Moor randomly picks up 5 marbles and multiplies the integers on top of them together, obtaining a single number. What is the maximum number of different products that Moor can obtain?","solution":"1. Factorization of 360:   We start by factorizing 360 into its prime factors:   [   360 = 2^3 cdot 3^2 cdot 5   ]   This means that any integer factor of 360 can be expressed as (2^a cdot 3^b cdot 5^c) where (0 leq a leq 3), (0 leq b leq 2), and (0 leq c leq 1).2. Counting the Factors:   The total number of factors of 360 can be calculated by considering all possible combinations of (a), (b), and (c):   [   (3+1)(2+1)(1+1) = 4 cdot 3 cdot 2 = 24   ]   Therefore, there are 24 different factors of 360.3. Labeling the Marbles:   To achieve the maximum number of different products, we need to label the marbles in such a way that we can form all 24 factors of 360 by picking any 5 out of the 13 marbles. One way to do this is to label five marbles with the factors (2, 3, 3, 4, 5) and the remaining eight marbles with 1. This ensures that any product formed by picking 5 marbles will be a factor of 360.4. Forming Different Products:   By choosing any 5 marbles out of the 13, we can form different products. Since the remaining 8 marbles are labeled with 1, they do not affect the product. The five marbles labeled with (2, 3, 3, 4, 5) can be combined in various ways to form all 24 factors of 360. For example:   - Picking (2, 3, 3, 4, 5) gives (2 cdot 3 cdot 3 cdot 4 cdot 5 = 360)   - Picking (1, 1, 1, 1, 1) gives (1)   - Picking (2, 3, 1, 1, 1) gives (2 cdot 3 = 6)   - And so on.5.

Initial Analysis:   We start by analyzing the expression ( x_i^2 - x_i x_j ). We can factor this as:   [   x_i^2 - x_i x_j = x_i (x_i - x_j)   ]   For this product to not be divisible by ( 1111 ), neither ( x_i ) nor ( x_i - x_j ) can be divisible by ( 1111 ).3.

Indeed, if in one of the columns the number of yellow cells is less than the number of red cells, then there will be fewer of them in the entire table, since in the other columns their number is not greater than the number of red cells. Moreover, the number of red cells in each column is not less than frac{5}{3}, that is, it is at least 2. Thus, the table contains at least 10 red cells and the same number of yellow cells. Therefore, there are no more than 5 blue cells in the table. On the other hand, in each column the total number of yellow and red cells is even, so there is at least one blue cell in each column.

It is known that the 19th vertex has the number 19, and the 20th vertex has the number 20. What number is in the 2019th vertex?","solution":"Answer: 61.Solution. Let the numbers at the vertices be denoted as x_{1}, x_{2}, ldots, x_{2019}. Since the sum of any nine consecutive numbers is the same, the numbers that are 8 apart are equal. Therefore, x_{1}=x_{10}=x_{19}=ldots=x_{1+9 k}=ldots. Since 2019 is not divisible by 9 but is divisible by 3, continuing this sequence in a cycle will include all numbers of the form x_{3 k+1}. Similar sequences can be constructed starting from the numbers x_{2} and x_{3}. Thus, the numbers at the vertices that have the same remainder when divided by 3 are equal.Since each set of nine consecutive numbers contains three sets of vertices with different remainders when divided by 3, the sum of the numbers in each such set is 100. Note that 19 gives a remainder of 1 when divided by 3, 20 gives a remainder of 2, and 2019 gives a remainder of 0, so the number at vertex 2019 is 100 - 19 - 20 = 61.## Criteria## The largest suitable criterion is used:## 7 p.

Determine the lowest possible n for which we can be sure that there are 6 participants between which any two participants know each other.","solution":"1. Translation to Graph Theory:   We translate the problem into graph theory. Let each participant be represented by a vertex in a graph, and an edge between two vertices indicates that the corresponding participants know each other. We need to find the minimum number ( n ) such that there is a complete subgraph ( K_6 ) (a clique of 6 vertices) in the graph.2. Using Turán's Theorem:   Turán's theorem provides a way to determine the maximum number of edges in a graph that does not contain a complete subgraph ( K_r ). Specifically, Turán's theorem states that the maximum number of edges in a graph with ( N ) vertices that does not contain a ( K_r ) is given by the Turán graph ( T_{N, r-1} ), which is an ( (r-1) )-partite graph.3. Constructing the Turán Graph:   For our problem, we need to ensure there is no ( K_6 ) subgraph. Therefore, we consider the Turán graph ( T_{1991, 5} ), which is a 5-partite graph. In this graph, the vertices are divided into 5 parts as equally as possible.4. Calculating the Minimum Degree:   In the Turán graph ( T_{1991, 5} ), each vertex is connected to all vertices in the other 4 parts. The number of vertices in each part is approximately ( leftlceil frac{1991}{5} rightrceil = 399 ) and ( leftlfloor frac{1991}{5} rightrfloor = 398 ). Therefore, each vertex is connected to at least ( 4 times 398 = 1592 ) vertices.5. Ensuring the Minimum Degree:   To ensure that every participant knows at least ( n ) other participants, we need ( n geq 1593 ). This is because in the Turán graph ( T_{1991, 5} ), each vertex has a degree of at least 1592, and to guarantee a ( K_6 ) subgraph, we need ( n ) to be at least one more than this value.6. Conclusion:   By Turán's theorem, if ( n = 1593 ), then the graph must contain a ( K_6 ) subgraph. Therefore, the lowest possible ( n ) for which we can be sure that there are 6 participants between which any two participants know each other is ( n = 1593 ).The final answer is ( boxed{ n = 1593 } )."},{"problem":"Let the complex number z satisfy |z| = 1.

Relate to the inequality:   - Notice that ( frac{d}{a+d} le 1 ), ( frac{d}{b+d} le 1 ), and ( frac{d}{c+d} le 1 ).   - Therefore, ( frac{d}{a+d} + frac{d}{b+d} + frac{d}{c+d} le 3 ).6.

From the condition, it follows that X contains no less than three numbers, which means there are non-zero numbers in it. By multiplying all numbers by minus one if necessary, we can assume that X contains positive numbers. Let's choose the largest number M from them. According to the condition, it is equal to the sum of two other distinct numbers from X, each of which is smaller than it. From the maximality of M, it follows that both of these numbers are positive. Therefore, X contains no less than three distinct positive numbers. Consider the smallest positive number boldsymbol{m}, it is equal to the sum of two other distinct numbers from X, one of which must be negative due to the minimality of boldsymbol{m}. Now let's choose the smallest negative number mathrm{N} from X, it is also equal to the sum of two other distinct numbers from X, each of which is greater than it. From the minimality of mathrm{N}, it follows that both of these numbers are negative. Therefore, X contains no less than three distinct negative numbers.

Since all the middle cells of the table can be divided into frac{6^2}{2} = 18 non-overlapping pairs (dominoes 1 times 2), in each of which there is no more than one main black cell, then s leqslant 18.In the initially white table, we will color the cells black one by one until there are 20, starting with s main black cells. We will say that a black cell ruins a pair of adjacent cells if it is in it. Each of the main black cells ruins 4 pairs, so in total they ruin 4s pairs. Next, we color in black, in any order, the middle non-main cells (which are already contained in at least one ruined pair) and the boundary cells (which in principle are contained in three or two pairs). The remaining 20-s black cells ruin no more than 3 pairs each, so in total they ruin no more than 3(20-s) = 60 - 3s new pairs. In total, no more than 4s + 60 - 3s = 60 + s leqslant 60 + 18 = 78 pairs are ruined. Then, the number of unruined pairs, consisting only of white cells, is no less than 112 - 78 = 34.An example with 34 pairs of white cells is constructed as follows: consider 18 main black cells and 2 more boundary cells, each of which does not form a pair with other black cells (Fig. 3).|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  || :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- ||  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  ||  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  ||  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  ||  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  ||  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  ||  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  ||  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |Fig. 3: to the solution of problem 9.6"},{"problem":"Find all pairs of functions f, g: mathbb{R} rightarrow mathbb{R} such that for all x, y in mathbb{R}, we have g(f(x+y))=f(x)+2 x+y cdot g(y)","solution":"(found by Elias Caeiro)By taking y=0, we get g(f(x))=f(x)+2 x, and by taking x=0, we have g(f(y))= f(0)+y g(y), sof(x+y)=g(f(x+y))-2(x+y)=f(x)+2 x+y g(y)-2(x+y)=f(x)+2 x+g(f(y))-f(0)-2(x+y)=f(x)+2 x+f(y)+2 y-f(0)-2(x+y)=f(x)+f(y)-f(0)By replacing f with h, where h(x)=f(x)-f(0), we get h(x+y)=h(x)+h(y), so for all r in mathbb{R}, h is linear on r mathbb{Q} and f is of the form f(z)=a z+b on r mathbb{Q}.For z in r mathbb{Q}^{*}, by taking y=f(n z) where n is an integer, we haveg(f(y))=f(y)+2 y=f(f(n z))+2 f(n z)=f(a n z+b)+2(a n z+b)=f(a n z)+f(b)-f(0)+2(a n z+b), which is a polynomial of degree 1 in n, since f is affine on a z mathbb{Q}.We also haveg(f(y))=f(0)+y g(y)=f(0)+f(n z) g(f(n z))=f(0)+(a n z+b)(f(n z)+2 n z)=f(0)+(a n z+b)(a n z+b+2 n z), which is a polynomial of degree at most 2 in n.We deduce that the coefficient of degree 2 of this polynomial is zero, so a z(a z+2)=0 and a must necessarily be 0 or -2.The values of a and b are bounded, so f is bounded on any bounded interval, and since f satisfies the Cauchy equation (up to a constant), f is affine, of the form a z+b with a equal to 0 or -2.f cannot be constant because we would have 2 x=g(f(x))-f(x)=g(b)-b for all x, which is obviously impossible.Therefore, f is of the form f(x)=-2 x+b. For any non-zero x, b=f(x)+2 x= g(f(x))=f(0)+y g(y)=b+y g(y), so y g(y)=0 and g(y)=0. f(0)=g(f(0)), so f(0) can only be zero, and g(0) as well. The only solution is therefore f(x)=-2 x and g(x)=0, which is easily verified to be a solution."},{"problem":"Dave rolls a fair six-sided die until a six appears for the first time. Independently, Linda rolls a fair six-sided die until a six appears for the first time. Let m and n be relatively prime positive integers such that dfrac mn is the probability that the number of times Dave rolls his die is equal to or within one of the number of times Linda rolls her die. Find m+n.","solution":"Solution 1There are many almost equivalent approaches that lead to summing a geometric series. For example, we can compute the probability of the opposite event. Let p be the probability that Dave will make at least two more throws than Linda. Obviously, p is then also the probability that Linda will make at least two more throws than Dave, and our answer will therefore be 1-2p.How to compute p? Suppose that Linda made exactly t throws. The probability that this happens is (5/6)^{t-1}cdot (1/6), as she must make t-1 unsuccessful throws followed by a successful one. In this case, we need Dave to make at least t+2 throws. This happens if his first t+1 throws are unsuccessful, hence the probability is (5/6)^{t+1}.Thus for a fixed t the probability that Linda makes t throws and Dave at least t+2 throws is (5/6)^{2t} cdot (1/6).Then, as the events for different t are disjoint, p is simply the sum of these probabilities over all t. Hence:begin{align*} p & = sum_{t=1}^infty left(frac 56right)^{2t} cdot frac 16  & = frac 16 cdot left(frac 56right)^2 cdot sum_{x=0}^infty left(frac{25}{36}right)^x  & = frac 16 cdot frac{25}{36} cdot frac 1{1 - dfrac{25}{36}}  & = frac 16 cdot frac{25}{36} cdot frac{36}{11}  & = frac {25}{66} end{align*}Hence the probability we were supposed to compute is 1 - 2p = 1 - 2cdot frac{25}{66} = 1 - frac{25}{33} = frac 8{33}, and the answer is 8+33 = boxed{041}.Solution 2Let p be the probability that the number of times Dave rolls his die is equal to or within one of the number of times Linda rolls her die. (We will call this event \\"a win\\", and the opposite event will be \\"a loss\\".)Let both players roll their first die. With probability frac 1{36}, both throw a six and we win.With probability frac{10}{36} exactly one of them throws a six. In this case, we win if the remaining player throws a six in their next throw, which happens with probability frac 16.Finally, with probability frac{25}{36} none of them throws a six. Now comes the crucial observation: At this moment, we are in exactly the same situation as in the beginning. Hence in this case we will win with probability p.We just derived the following linear equation:[p = frac 1{36} + frac{10}{36} cdot frac 16 + frac{25}{36} cdot p]Solving for p, we get p=frac 8{33}, hence the answer is 8+33 = boxed{041}.Solution 3Let's write out the probabilities with a set number of throws that Linda rolls before getting a 6. The probability of Linda rolling once and gets 6 right away is frac{1}{6}. The probability that Dave will get a six in the same, one less, or one more throw is frac{1}{6} + frac{5}{6} * frac{5}{6}. Thus the combined probability is frac{11}{216}. Let's do the same with the probability that Linda rolls twice and getting a six. This time it is frac{5}{6} * frac{1}{6}. The probability that Dave meets the requirements set is frac{1}{6} + frac{5}{6} * frac{1}{6} + frac{5}{6} * frac{5}{6} * frac{1}{6}. Combine the probabilities again to get frac{455}{7776}. (or not, because you can simplify without calculating later)It's clear that as the number of rolls before getting a six increases, the probability that Dave meets the requirements is multiplied by frac{5}{6} * frac{5}{6}. We can use this pattern to solve for the sum of an infinite geometric series.First, set the case where Linda rolls only once aside. It doesn't fit the same pattern as the rest, so we'll add it separately at the end. Next, let a = (frac{5}{6} * frac{1}{6}) * (frac{1}{6} + frac{5}{6} * frac{1}{6} + frac{5}{6} * frac{5}{6} * frac{1}{6}) = frac{455}{7776} as written above. Each probability where the number of tosses Linda makes increases by one will be a * (frac{25}{36})^{n+1}. Let S be the sum of all these probabilities. S = a + a * frac{25}{36} + a * (frac{25}{36})^2...S * frac{25}{36} = a * frac{25}{36} + a * (frac{25}{36})^2 + a * (frac{25}{36})^3...Subtract the second equation from the first to getS * frac{11}{36} = aS = a * frac{36}{11}S = frac{455}{2376}Don't forget to add the first case where Linda rolls once.frac{455}{2376} + frac{11}{216} = frac{8}{33}8 + 33 = boxed{41}-jackshi2006Note: this is equivalent to computing frac{1}{36}(sum_{n=1}^{infty} (frac{5}{6})^n((frac{5}{6})^{n-1}+(frac{5}{6})^{n}+(frac{5}{6})^{n+1})+1+frac{5}{6})"},{"problem":"16.

The term 2cdot(e-1)^{0} simplifies to 2cdot1=2 because anything to the power of 0 is 1.3. The term frac{1}{sqrt{5}+2} simplifies directly by considering it as part of the final computation due to its fractional nature.4. The term 16^{frac{1}{4}} is the fourth root of 16, which is 2 because 2^4 = 16.5. The term sqrt[4]{(3-pi)^{4}} simplifies to |(3-pi)| because taking the fourth root and raising to the fourth power are inverse operations. Since pi is approximately 3.14, 3-pi is negative, but the absolute value makes it positive, so |(3-pi)| = |pi - 3|.Combining these terms, we have:[2cdot 7^{frac{2}{3}}+2+frac{1}{sqrt{5}+2}-16^{frac{1}{4}}+sqrt[4]{(3-pi)^{4}} = 2cdotsqrt[3]{49} + 2 + frac{1}{sqrt{5}+2} - 2 + |pi - 3|][= 2cdotsqrt[3]{49} + 2 + sqrt{5} - 2 - 2 + pi - 3][= 4 + pi + sqrt{5}]Therefore, the simplified expression is boxed{4 + pi + sqrt{5}}.For problem (2), let's break down and simplify the expression step by step:1.

Similarly, log_{3}5+log_{9}5 can be rewritten as frac{log 5}{log 3}+frac{log 5}{log 9}.3. The expression lg 2 is simply log_{10}2.Combining these transformations, the original expression becomes:[left(frac{log 3}{log 2}+frac{log 3}{log 5}right)cdotleft(frac{log 5}{log 3}+frac{log 5}{log 9}right)cdotlog_{10}2][=frac{log 3(log 2+log 5)}{log 2log 5}cdotfrac{log 5(log 3+log 9)}{log 3log 9}cdotlog_{10}2][=frac{log 3+2log 3}{2log 3}cdotlog_{10}2][=frac{3}{2}cdotlog_{10}2]Since log_{10}2 is part of the simplification process but not affecting the fraction, the final result simplifies to:[boxed{frac{3}{2}}]"},{"problem":"If the solution set of the inequality x^{2}+ax+b lt 0 with respect to x is left(-1,4right), then ab=______.","solution":"Given the problem statement, we need to find the value of ab given that the solution set of the inequality x^{2}+ax+b < 0 is (-1,4).

This implies that set A can indeed form a right triangle, as it satisfies the Pythagorean theorem.- For set B: 1^2 + 1^2 = 1 + 1 = 2 and (sqrt{2})^2 = 2. Thus, we have 1^2 + 1^2 = (sqrt{2})^2. This shows that set B can form a right triangle, as it meets the criteria of the Pythagorean theorem.- For set C: 6^2 + 8^2 = 36 + 64 = 100 and 13^2 = 169. Here, we find 6^2 + 8^2 neq 13^2.

It is verified that for n leqslant 2, the only solution is the pair (1,2). We will prove that for n geqslant 3 there are no solutions.The number x must be odd, so x^{2}+2 equiv 3(bmod 8). From xleft(x^{2}+2right) equiv-1 (bmod 8) it follows that x equiv 5(bmod 8). Furthermore, since 3 mid xleft(x^{2}+2right) (if 3 nmid x then left.3 mid x^{2}+2right), it must be that 2^{n} equiv 1(bmod 3), so n is an even number.By adding 2 to both sides of the equation, we get(x+1)left(x^{2}-x+3right)=2^{n}+2Since n is even, 2^{n} is a perfect square, so the number -2 is a quadratic residue modulo any odd prime divisor p of the number (x+1)left(x^{2}-x+3right).

The one who, after their roll, makes the sum first divisible by 4 wins. If Anna starts, what is the probability that she wins?","solution":"Solution. Regardless of the sum of the numbers rolled up to a given moment - unless it is divisible by 4, in which case the game ends - the next player can roll a number that ensures a win: if the sum is of the form 4k+1, they can roll a 3; if it is of the form 4k+2, they can roll a 2 or a 6; and if it is of the form 4k+3, they can roll a 1 or a 5.Thus, with each roll, there is at least a frac{1}{6} chance that the game will end with the next roll. The probability that the game has not ended after n rolls is at most left(frac{5}{6}right)^{n}, and this value approaches zero. Therefore, the game ends with probability 1.Suppose that at a given state of the game, the sum of the rolled numbers is of the form 4k+r (0 leq r leq 3). If P_{r} denotes the probability that the next player - who could be either Anna or Zsófi, let's call them X - eventually wins, then this probability clearly depends only on the remainder r. On the other hand, since the game ends, the other player, who follows X, wins with probability 1-P_{r}. Here, it is clear that P_{0}=0, since X has already lost. If X's roll results in a sum of the form 4k+r', then now it is not X who follows, so according to the above, 1-P_{r'} is the probability that X wins. In the following, we use this simple observation when writing down the probabilities P_{r}.Let's examine the non-zero remainders; let r=1 first, and see what the probability is that X wins the game in the situation that arises after their possible rolls. If they roll a 3 - the probability of which is frac{1}{6} - then they win with probability left(1-P_{0}right)=1. If they roll a 1 or a 5 - the probability of which is frac{1}{3} - then, arriving at a number of the form 4k+2, they win with probability left(1-P_{2}right). Similarly, if they roll a 2 or a 6 - the probability of which is also frac{1}{3} - then they win with probability left(1-P_{3}right), and if they roll a 4, they win with probability left(1-P_{1}right). Therefore:P_{1}=frac{1}{6}left(1-P_{0}right)+frac{1}{3}left(1-P_{2}right)+frac{1}{3}left(1-P_{3}right)+frac{1}{6}left(1-P_{1}right)Similarly, the probabilities P_{2} and P_{3} can be written as:begin{aligned}& P_{2}=frac{1}{3}left(1-P_{0}right)+frac{1}{3}left(1-P_{3}right)+frac{1}{6}left(1-P_{1}right)+frac{1}{6}left(1-P_{2}right), quad text { and } & P_{3}=frac{1}{3}left(1-P_{0}right)+frac{1}{3}left(1-P_{1}right)+frac{1}{6}left(1-P_{2}right)+frac{1}{6}left(1-P_{3}right)end{aligned}Rearranging the three equations, we get the following system of equations:7 P_{1}+2 P_{2}+2 P_{3}=6From (2):P_{1}+7 P_{2}+2 P_{3}=6From (3):2 P_{1}+P_{2}+7 P_{3}=6.Solving the system of equations, we find that P_{1}=frac{50}{99}, P_{2}=frac{60}{99}, P_{3}=frac{62}{99}.Now let's turn to the game between the two players, Anna and Zsófi. If Anna rolls a number of the form 4k+r on her first turn, then according to the above, she wins with probability 1-P_{0}=1 if r=0; and with probability 1-P_{r} if r=1,2,3. Since she rolls a 0 or 3 remainder with probability frac{1}{6} and a 1 (1 and 5) or 2 (2 and 6) with probability frac{1}{3}, the probability that Anna wins as the starting player is:frac{1}{6}left(1-P_{0}right)+frac{1}{3}left(1-P_{1}right)+frac{1}{3}left(1-P_{2}right)+frac{1}{6}left(1-P_{3}right)=frac{1}{6}+frac{1}{3} cdot frac{49}{99}+frac{1}{3} cdot frac{39}{99}+frac{1}{6} cdot frac{37}{99}=frac{52}{99}which is slightly greater than frac{1}{2}.Remark. Many omitted the proof that the game ends with probability 1, thus the above reasoning is incomplete."},{"problem":"1. Let A B C be triangle in which A B=A C.

Now we are given that H is the orthocentre of the triangle. Let A B=A C=b and B C=2 a. Then B D=a. Observe that b>a since b is the hypotenuse and a is a leg of a right-angled triangle.

We want to compute B H in another way. Since A, F, H, E are con-cyclic, we haveB H cdot B E=B F cdot B ABut B F cdot B A=B D cdot B C=2 a^{2}, since A, F, D, C are con-cyclic. Hence B H^{2}=4 a^{4} / B E^{2}. ButB E^{2}=4 a^{2}-C E^{2}=4 a^{2}-B F^{2}=4 a^{2}-left(frac{2 a^{2}}{b}right)^{2}=frac{4 a^{2}left(b^{2}-a^{2}right)}{b^{2}}This leads toB H^{2}=frac{a^{2} b^{2}}{b^{2}-a^{2}}Thus we getfrac{a^{2} b^{2}}{b^{2}-a^{2}}=a^{2}+4 r^{2}This simplifies to left(a^{4} /left(b^{2}-a^{2}right)right)=4 r^{2}. Now we relate a, b, r in another way using area. We know that [A B C]=r s, where s is the semi-perimeter of A B C. We have s=(b+b+2 a) / 2=b+a. On the other hand area can be calculated using Heron's formula::[A B C]^{2}=s(s-2 a)(s-b)(s-b)=(b+a)(b-a) a^{2}=a^{2}left(b^{2}-a^{2}right)Hencer^{2}=frac{[A B C]^{2}}{s^{2}}=frac{a^{2}left(b^{2}-a^{2}right)}{(b+a)^{2}}Using this we getfrac{a^{4}}{b^{2}-a^{2}}=4left(frac{a^{2}left(b^{2}-a^{2}right)}{(b+a)^{2}}right)Therefore a^{2}=4(b-a)^{2}, which gives a=2(b-a) or 2 b=3 a. Finally,frac{A B}{B C}=frac{b}{2 a}=frac{3}{4}## Alternate Solution 1:We use the known facts B H=2 R cos B and r=4 R sin (A / 2) sin (B / 2) sin (C / 2), where R is the circumradius of triangle A B C and r its in-radius. ThereforeH D=B H sin angle H B D=2 R cos B sin left(frac{pi}{2}-Cright)=2 R cos ^{2} Bsince angle C=angle B. But angle B=(pi-angle A) / 2, since A B C is isosceles. Thus we obtainH D=2 R cos ^{2}left(frac{pi}{2}-frac{A}{2}right)However H D is also the diameter of the in circle. Therefore H D=2 r. Thus we get2 R cos ^{2}left(frac{pi}{2}-frac{A}{2}right)=2 r=8 R sin (A / 2) sin ^{2}((pi-A) / 4)This reduces tosin (A / 2)=2(1-sin (A / 2))Therefore sin (A / 2)=2 / 3. We also observe that sin (A / 2)=B D / A B. Finallyfrac{A B}{B C}=frac{A B}{2 B D}=frac{1}{2 sin (A / 2)}=frac{3}{4}## Alternate Solution 2:Let D be the mid-point of B C. Extend A D to meet the circumcircle in L. Then we know that H D=D L. But H D=2 r. Thus D L=2 r. Therefore I L=I D+D L=r+2 r=3 r. We also know that L B=L I. Therefore L B=3 r. This givesfrac{B L}{L D}=frac{3 r}{2 r}=frac{3}{2}But triangle B L D is similar to triangle A B D. Sofrac{A B}{B D}=frac{B L}{L D}=frac{3}{2}Finally,frac{A B}{B C}=frac{A B}{2 B D}=frac{3}{4}## Alternate Solution 3:Let D be the mid-point of B C and E be the mid-point of D C. Since D I=I H(=r) and D E=E C, the mid-point theorem implies that I E | C H. But C H perp A B. Therefore E I perp A B. Let E I meet A B in F. Then F is the point of tangency of the incircle of triangle A B C with A B. Since the incircle is also tangent to B C at D, we have B F=B D. Observe that triangle B F E is similar to triangle B D A. Hencefrac{A B}{B D}=frac{B E}{B F}=frac{B E}{B D}=frac{B D+D E}{B D}=1+frac{D E}{B D}=frac{3}{2}This givesfrac{A B}{B C}=frac{3}{4}"},{"problem":"7. Let n be a positive integer greater than 1 .

To show that a property mathcal{P}_{n} is true for all n, when we cannot systematically deduce the property at a given rank from a certain number k of previous properties (fixed in advance like the order of a hypothetical recurrence), we can proceed as follows:triangleright Initialization: we verify that the property mathcal{P}_{0} is true.triangleright Induction step: we assume that there exists a natural number n such that the properties mathcal{P}_{0}, mathcal{P}_{1}, ldots, mathcal{P}_{n} are all true.

For example, 42 in base ten is 4 times 10^{1}+2 times 1. In this base, two numbers written differently are necessarily different: we say that there is uniqueness of decomposition in this base.Similarly, every number can be written uniquely in base 2: for example, since 42=1 times 2^{5}+0 times 2^{4}+1 times 2^{3}+0 times 2^{2}+1 times 2+0 times 1,42 in base 10 is 101010 in base 2.We similarly define the Fibonacci base, where the allowed digits are 0 and 1, and where the position of a digit corresponds to the rank, in the Fibonacci sequence, of the Fibonacci number by which it is multiplied. In this base, there is no uniqueness of decomposition: for example, 011 and 100 in the Fibonacci base both equal 3 in base 10. More generally, we can always replace two consecutive 1s with two 0s by adding 1 in the next column (since left.F_{n+2}=F_{n+1}+F_{n}right).We say that a decomposition in the Fibonacci base is valid if it does not contain two consecutive 1s."},{"problem":"In triangle ABC, angle A=30^circ, angle B=45^circ, and b=8, then a=    .","solution":"According to the Law of Sines, we havefrac{a}{sin A} = frac{b}{sin B}Therefore, a can be calculated asa = frac{b sin A}{sin B} = frac{8 sin 30^circ}{sin 45^circ} = frac{8 times frac{1}{2}}{frac{sqrt{2}}{2}} = 4sqrt{2}Hence, the answer is boxed{4sqrt{2}}."},{"problem":"For any function y=f(x), in the same Cartesian coordinate system, the graphs of the functions y=f(x-19) and y=f(99-x) are definitely symmetric about ( ).(A) y-axis(B) line x=19(C) line x=59(D) line x=9 y保留了原文的换行和格式，但选项 (C) 和 (D) 中的“苋线”和“胃线”在英文中没有对应的术语，因此直接翻译为“line”。如果需要更准确的表述，请提供这些术语的具体含义。","solution":"4.

But since their product is three times a square, one of them must be a square and the other three times a square. We cannot have 2n - 1 be three times a square, for then 2n + 1 would be a square congruent to 2 modulo 3, which is impossible.Thus 2n - 1 is a square, say b^2. But 2n + 79 is also a square, say a^2. Then (a + b)(a - b) = a^2 - b^2 = 80. Since a + b and a - b have the same parity and their product is even, they are both even. To maximize n, it suffices to maximize 2b = (a + b) - (a - b) and check that this yields an integral value for m. This occurs when a + b = 40 and a - b = 2, that is, when a = 21 and b = 19. This yields n = 181 and m = 104, so the answer is boxed{181}.Solution 2Suppose that the consecutive cubes are m and m + 1.

Hence all solutions to the first condition are in the form:[(2 + sqrt {3})^{2k + 1} = a_k + sqrt {3}b_k]where k = 0,1,2,... So we can (with very little effort) obtain the following: (k,a_k = 2n) = (0,2),(1,26),(2,362),(3,5042). It is an AIME problem so it is implicit that n < 1000, so 2n < 2000. It is easy to see that a_n is strictly increasing by induction. Checking 2n = 362implies n =boxed{181} in the second condition works (we know b_k is odd so we don't need to find m). So we're done.Solution 3 (Big Bash)Let us generate numbers 1 to 1000 for the second condition, for squares. We know for N to be integer, the squares must be odd.

Given a_1=-2 and the recursive relation a_{n+1}+3S_n+2=0 for ninmathbb{N}^*,   For n=1, we have a_2 + 3S_1 + 2 = 0. Since S_1 = a_1 = -2, we get a_2 + 3(-2) + 2 = 0 which leads to a_2 = 4.      For n=2, we have a_3 + 3S_2 + 2 = 0. Since S_2 = a_1 + a_2 = -2 + 4 = 2, we get a_3 + 3(2) + 2 = 0 which leads to a_3 = -8.      Thus, we have boxed{a_2 = 4} and boxed{a_3 = -8}.2.

[     u_{n+2} = frac{1}{2} left( sqrt{u_{n+1}} + sqrt{u_n} right)     ]     Since ( 0 < u_n < 1 ) and ( 0 < u_{n+1} < 1 ), we have ( 0 < sqrt{u_n} < 1 ) and ( 0 < sqrt{u_{n+1}} < 1 ).

By induction, ( u_n < 1 ) for all ( n ).2. Convergence:   - Since ( 0 < u_n < 1 ) for all ( n ), the sequence is bounded.   - To show that the sequence is monotonic, we need to prove that it is either non-increasing or non-decreasing from some index ( n_0 ).   - Consider the function ( f(x) = frac{1}{2} left( sqrt{x} + sqrt{u_{n-1}} right) ). This function is continuous and strictly increasing for ( x in (0, 1) ).   - If ( u_n leq u_{n+1} ), then ( u_{n+1} leq u_{n+2} ) because     [     u_{n+2} = frac{1}{2} left( sqrt{u_{n+1}} + sqrt{u_n} right) geq frac{1}{2} left( sqrt{u_n} + sqrt{u_n} right) = u_n     ]   - Similarly, if ( u_n geq u_{n+1} ), then ( u_{n+1} geq u_{n+2} ).   - Therefore, the sequence ( u_n ) is eventually monotonic.3. Finding the Limit:   - Let ( L ) be the limit of the sequence ( u_n ). Since the sequence is convergent, we have     [     lim_{n to infty} u_n = L     ]   - Taking the limit on both sides of the recurrence relation, we get     [     L = frac{1}{2} left( sqrt{L} + sqrt{L} right)     ]     Simplifying, we obtain     [     L = sqrt{L}     ]   - Solving ( L = sqrt{L} ), we get ( L^2 = L ), which gives ( L(L - 1) = 0 ).

Therefore, the number of chickens is (40 + 2) div (5 + 1) = 7, and the number of rabbits is 40 - 7 = 33.Method 4: Let the number of chicken feet be 1 unit, then the number of rabbit feet is 10 units minus 8. If we consider chickens as rabbits, since one rabbit has twice the number of feet as one chicken, the total number of feet increases by 1 unit. The total number of feet is 40 times 4 = 160.

Base Case: (k = 0)   [   8^0 = 1 = x^3 + y^3 + z^3 - 3xyz.   ]   We need to find nonnegative integer solutions ((x, y, z)) such that (x le y le z).    Consider the equation:   [   x^3 + y^3 + z^3 - 3xyz = (x + y + z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - xz - yz).   ]   For (1 = (x + y + z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - xz - yz)), we need to find the values of (x, y, z) that satisfy this equation.    The only solution in nonnegative integers is:   [   (x, y, z) = (0, 0, 1).   ]   Therefore, for (k = 0), there is exactly 1 solution.2. Inductive Step:   Assume that for (k = n-1), there are (n) solutions. We need to show that for (k = n), there are (n+1) solutions.

Now consider the equation for (k = n):   [   8^n = x^3 + y^3 + z^3 - 3xyz.   ]   We can generate solutions for (k = n) by multiplying each solution ((x_i, y_i, z_i)) of (k = n-1) by 2:   [   (2x_i, 2y_i, 2z_i).   ]   This gives us (n) solutions for (k = n).   Additionally, for any solution ((x, y, z)) where (x, y, z) are all even, dividing each by 2 gives a solution for (k = n-1). Since we have (n) solutions for (k = n-1), we get (n) even-even-even solutions for (k = n).

Consider the property of divisibility by ( d ):   Let ( n ) be a positive integer with digits ( a_1, a_2, ldots, a_k ). We can express ( n ) in its decimal form as:   [   n = a_1 cdot 10^{k-1} + a_2 cdot 10^{k-2} + cdots + a_k   ]   If ( d ) divides ( n ), then ( d ) must also divide any number obtained by rearranging the digits of ( n ).2. Rearranging the digits:   Consider a rearrangement of the digits of ( n ), say ( m ). Then ( m ) can be written as:   [   m = b_1 cdot 10^{k-1} + b_2 cdot 10^{k-2} + cdots + b_k   ]   where ( {b_1, b_2, ldots, b_k} ) is a permutation of ( {a_1, a_2, ldots, a_k} ).3.

Divisibility by 9:   Notice that the sum of the digits of ( n ) and ( m ) is the same. Therefore, ( n equiv m pmod{9} ). This implies that ( n - m ) is divisible by 9:   [   n - m equiv 0 pmod{9}   ]   Hence, ( d ) must divide 9.5. Possible values of ( d ):   The divisors of 9 are ( 1, 3, ) and ( 9 ).

Solving the eight systems of equations in turn:(I) b quad=1 2 a+b+1=2000(II) b quad=5 2 a+b+1=400(III) b quad=25 2 a+b+1=80(IV) b quad=125 2 a+b+1=16(V) 2 a+b+1=1b=2000From here a=999, thus we get the solution with 1 term 1000=1000.b=400From here a=197, thus we get the solution with 5 terms 1000=198+199+200+201+202.From here a=27, thus we get the solution with 25 terms 1000=28+29+ldots+51+52.From here a=-55, thus we get the solution with 125 terms 1000=(-54)+(-53)+ldots+69+70.From here a=-1000, thus we get the solution with 2000 terms 1000=(-999)+(-998)+ldots 999+1000.From here a=-198, thus we get the solution with 400 terms 1000=(-197)+(-196)+ldots+201+202.(VII) 2 a+b+1=25b=80(VIII) 2 a+b+1=125 quad From here a=54, thus we get the solution with 16 terms 1000=55+56+ldots+70.From here a=-28, thus we get the solution with 80 terms 1000=(-27)+(-26)+ldots+51+52. b=16The solutions obtained are different, so the number 1000 can be written as the sum of consecutive integers in eight or seven ways, depending on whether we consider the single-term decomposition 1000=1000 as a solution or not.II. solution. If a geq 0 and(a+1)+(a+2)+ldots+(a+b)=1000then(-a)+(-a+1)+ldots+a+(a+1)+ldots+(a+b)=1000also holds. In the two decompositions, a total of 2 a+2 b+1, that is, an odd number of numbers appear, so one sum has an even number of terms, and the other has an odd number of terms. Therefore, it is sufficient to find the number of decompositions that consist of an odd number of terms, and the number of all decompositions will be twice this number. (Or one less if we do not consider the single-term decomposition.)So let a decomposition consist of 2 k+1 numbers. Then the numbers before the middle - the (k+1)-th - are 1, 2, ..., k smaller, and the ones after the middle are 1, 2, ..., k larger than the number in the middle, so the sum is exactly the middle number multiplied by 2 k+1. This means that (2 k+1) is a divisor of 1000.Conversely, if (2 k+1) is an odd divisor of 1000, that is, 1000=(2 k+1) m, then in the decomposition 1000=m+m+ldots+m, if we decrease the terms before the middle by 1, 2, ..., k and increase the terms after the middle by 1, 2, ..., k, the sum does not change, and on the right side, we get the sum of consecutive integers.Since the number of terms in different decompositions cannot be the same, by matching the number of terms in the odd-term decompositions, we have established a one-to-one correspondence between the odd-term decompositions of 1000 and the odd divisors of 1000. The number 1000 has 4 odd divisors, so it can be decomposed into the sum of consecutive integers in four ways with an odd number of terms. Accordingly, it can be written as the sum of consecutive integers in eight or seven ways.Remarks. 1. In the first solution, we do not necessarily have to solve 8 systems of equations, especially since the question is only about the number of solutions. The steps in writing equation (1) are reversible, so we get twice as many - and different - solutions as the number of ways 2000 can be decomposed into the product of an odd and an even number. One factor is the number of terms in the decomposition, and the other is the sum of the first and last terms. 2000 can be decomposed into the product of an odd and an even number in as many ways as it has odd divisors, since it is even. The number 2000 has as many odd divisors as the number 1000.2. If we exclude decompositions with a single term, then with any of the above lines of reasoning, we get that if a number has k odd divisors, then it can be written as the sum of consecutive integers in (2 k-1) ways. (If a number's prime factorization is 2^{kappa} cdot p_{1}{ }^{beta_{1}} cdot p_{2}{ }^{beta_{2}} ldots p_{n}{ }^{beta_{n}}, then the number of its odd divisors is k=left(beta_{1}+1right)left(beta_{2}+1right) ldotsleft(beta_{n}+1right).3. If only positive terms are allowed in the decomposition, then using the fact that in the second solution, we not only divided the decompositions into two equal groups according to the parity of the number of terms they contain, but also according to whether the first term in each sum is positive or not, it follows that a number can be written as the sum of consecutive positive integers in exactly one less way than the number of its odd divisors. Specifically, if a number has only one odd divisor, then it cannot be written in this way. Since 1 is a divisor of every integer, these are the numbers that have no other odd divisors besides 1. These are precisely the powers of 2. We have thus also learned that the powers of 2 - and only these - cannot be written as the sum of consecutive positive integers."},{"problem":"7.

The centers of the viewing circles corresponding to the given angles in the picture are 1 + 3/2 = 2.5 meters above the viewer's eye level. The viewing angle is larger the smaller the radius of the viewing circle (Figure 1). Therefore, we need to find the viewing circle with the smallest radius that has a point at eye level.

However, triangles (AND) and (ABD) share the side (AD). We draw the heights from vertices (N) and (B) in triangles (AND) and (ABD), respectively. Let (K) be the foot of the height from vertex (B) in triangle (ABD) and (J) be the foot of the height from vertex (N) in triangle (AND). We then have[frac{|AND|}{|ABD|} = frac{frac{1}{2} cdot AD cdot NJ}{frac{1}{2} cdot AD cdot BK} = frac{NJ}{BK}]Since the lines ((MI)) and ((BK)) are perpendicular to segment ([AD]), they are parallel. Quadrilateral (JNBK) is therefore a parallelogram with two right angles, making it a rectangle. Thus, (NJ = BK) and therefore[|AND| = |ABD| = frac{1}{2}]We apply the same method to compare the areas of triangles (AND) and (AMD). We introduce (J) as the foot of the height from vertex (N) and observe that[frac{|AMD|}{|AND|} = frac{|AMD|}{|ABD|} = frac{frac{1}{2} cdot AD cdot MI}{frac{1}{2} cdot AD cdot BK} = frac{MI}{BK}]The lines ((BK)) and ((MI)) are parallel, so by Thales' theorem for triangles (ABK) and (AMI), we find[frac{MI}{BK} = frac{MD}{DB} = frac{MD}{MB + MD} = frac{3MB}{MB + 3MB} = frac{3}{4}]Thus, (|AMD| = frac{3}{4} |ABD| = frac{3}{8}).We can then conclude that[|MND| = |AND| - |AMD| = frac{1}{2} - frac{3}{8} = frac{1}{8}]This allows us to conclude that the area of triangle (MND) is (frac{1}{8})."},{"problem":"9.3.

Case when (p = q = 3):   - If (p = q = 3), then the congruences become:     [ 3^{n+2} equiv 3^{n+2} pmod{3^n} ]     [ 3^{n+2} equiv 3^{n+2} pmod{3^n} ]   - These are trivially true for any positive integer (n).   - Therefore, ((3, 3, n)) is a solution for any positive integer (n).2. Case when (p, q, 3) are pairwise distinct:   - Assume (p > q) without loss of generality.   - From the given congruences, we have:     [ p^n mid q^{n+2} - 3^{n+2} ]     [ q^n mid p^{n+2} - 3^{n+2} ]   - This implies:     [ p^n q^n mid p^{n+2} + q^{n+2} - 3^{n+2} ]   - Since (p) and (q) are primes, we have:     [ p^n q^n leq p^{n+2} + q^{n+2} - 3^{n+2} < 2p^{n+2} ]   - Therefore:     [ q^n < 2p^2 ]     [ p^2 > q^{n-1} ]   - Additionally, from (q^{n+2} - 3^{n+2} geq p^n), we get:     [ q^{n+2} > p^n > q^{n(n-1)/2} ]   - Thus:     [ n+2 > frac{n(n-1)}{2} ]   - Solving this inequality, we find:     [ n leq 3 ]3.

If (p mid q + 3), then (q + 3 < 2p), so (p = q + 3), which is impossible.   - Therefore, (p^2 mid q^2 + 9). Since (q^2 + 9 < 2p^2), we have:     [ q^2 + 9 = p^2 ]     [ (p + q)(p - q) = 9 ]   - Solving this, we get (p + q = 9) and (p - q = 1), leading to (p = 5) and (q = 4), which is a contradiction since 4 is not a prime.4. Subcase (n = 3):   - For (n = 3), the congruences become:     [ p^3 mid q^5 - 243 ]     [ q^3 mid p^5 - 243 ]     [ p^3 q^3 mid p^5 + q^5 - 243 ]   - If (p = 5), then (q^3 mid 5^5 - 3^5 = 2 cdot 11 cdot 131), which is impossible.   - Therefore, (p neq 5) and similarly (q neq 5).5. Further analysis:   - Assume (q mid p - 3). Note that (p^3 leq q^5 - 243 < q^6), so (p < q^2). Thus, (p - 3) is not divisible by (q^2).   - We have (q^3 mid p^5 - 243), so:     [ q mid p^4 + 3p^3 + 9p^2 + 27p + 81 ]     [ 0 equiv p^4 + 3p^3 + 9p^2 + 27p + 81 equiv 5 cdot 3^4 pmod{q} ]   - Thus, (q = 3) or (5), which is impossible.6.

Due to the way points A and B are chosen, any other points in the set S, different from A, B, C, cannot lie outside any of these circles. We will prove that they cannot be inside their common interior region, nor on the arcs AB, BC, CA of these circles. It is sufficient to prove that there are no points in the region bounded by segments OB and OC (where O is the center of triangle ABC), and arc BC—let us denote this region by F. Suppose there is a point D in S in region F, different from B and C. Then for some D' in S, triangle ADD' is equilateral, i.e., point D' is obtained by rotating point D around point A by an angle of 60^circ (in some direction). During this rotation, one of the points B and C is mapped to the other, for example, B is mapped to C = B'. It is easy to prove that in this process, the segment BO is mapped to a segment B'O' which lies on the tangent to the circle (B, AB) at point C. From this, it follows that the entire region F except for the point B is mapped to a region where we have already proven that there are no points of the set S. This means that D' = B' and D = B, which is impossible. The contradiction obtained proves that the set S does not contain any other points besides A, B, C.## Fourth Year"},{"problem":"5.

Since the total number of students is 600 and a sample of 50 students is to be selected, the sampling interval is frac{600}{50} = 12. This means every 12th student is selected into the sample starting from the randomly chosen first number, which is 003.Given the numbering of the students in each camp:- Camp I: 001 to 300- Camp II: 301 to 495- Camp III: 496 to 600We can see that the first student from Camp III who could be selected is number 496. To find out which of the students from Camp III are selected, we calculate the sequence of selected numbers starting from 003 by adding the sampling interval of 12 repeatedly. The sequence of selected numbers is 003, 015, 027, ..., up to the maximum number 600. To find the first selected number in Camp III, we need to find the smallest number in the sequence that is greater than or equal to 496. This can be done by solving for n in the equation 003 + 12(n-1) geq 496, where n is the position of the number in the sequence.Solving the equation gives us the position of the first number from Camp III in the sequence. Continuing this process until we reach the last number in the sequence that is less than or equal to 600, we can count the total number of selected students from Camp III.After performing these calculations, we find that the number of students from Camp III selected in the sample is boxed{8}."},{"problem":"Given the line l: begin{cases} x=2+ frac{1}{2}t  y=frac{ sqrt{3}}{2}t end{cases}(ttext{ is a parameter}), and the curve C_{1}: begin{cases} x=2cos theta  y=2sin theta end{cases}(thetatext{ is a parameter})(1) The line l intersects the curve C_{1} at points A and B.

We deduce thatf(2 x+a)=f(f(2 x))=f(x+a)+xand, if we set x=-a, it follows that f(-a)=f(0)-a=0.We then consider an arbitrary real number x, and we set y=-f(-2 x)-a and z=-x+f(y). Since f(-a)=0, the equation mathbf{E}(-x, y) shows that f(z)-x=f(-a)=0, that is, f(z)=x. The function f is therefore surjective.Let us prove that f is also injective. Let x and y be two real numbers such that f(x)=f(y), and let d=y-x. Let t be an arbitrary real number, and let z be a preimage of t by f.

But then the equation mathbf{E}(x, 0) indicates thatx=f^{2}(2 x)-f(x+a)=f^{2}(2 y)-f(y+a)=ycontradicting the fact that d neq 0.The function f is therefore indeed injective.

Therefore, it must be that n geqq 5.By substituting the already known prime numbers p_{1}=2, p_{2}=2, p_{3}=5, p_{4}=101 into equation (1) and dividing by 2020, we get the equation110+p_{5}+p_{6}+ldots+p_{n}=p_{5} cdot p_{6} cdot ldots cdot p_{n}Since we are looking for the smallest possible n geqq 5 for which there exist prime numbers p_{5}, p_{6}, ldots, p_{n} satisfying equation (2), we will further analyze the smallest possible values of n=5,6, ldots, until we find the first suitable n.- Case n=5.

Equation (2) has the formp_{5} p_{6} p_{7}=p_{5}+p_{6}+p_{7}+110 .Let us emphasize that our task is only to determine whether there exists a triplet of prime numbers that satisfies equation (4). It is not difficult to guess the triplet p_{5}=p_{6}=p_{7}=5:5^{3}=125=5+5+5+110 .This completes the solution of the problem. Let us add that other triplets of prime numbers that satisfy equation (4) are (2,5,13) and (2,3,23). Therefore, if we do not guess the triplet (5,5,5), we can complete the solution by substituting the smallest existing prime number p_{5}=2 into equation (4).

Answer: 5 .Without loss of generality, we may assume that every problem is solved by some student. Let A be one of the students. By assumption each of the 9 other students solves at least one common problem as mathrm{A}.

Suppose one kid has 1 coin and the other kid has 1 coin. The condition for interchange is that one of the kids must have at least half of all the coins, which is 1 coin in this case. Since both kids have 1 coin, an interchange can occur. After the interchange, the distribution of coins remains the same. Thus, the number of interchanges is 1, which is equal to ( n ).2. Inductive Step:   - Assume that for ( n = k ), after the ( k )-th interchange, the number of coins each kid has is divisible by ( 2^k ). We need to show that for ( n = k+1 ), after the ( (k+1) )-th interchange, the number of coins each kid has is divisible by ( 2^{k+1} ).3.

Initially, one kid has ( 2^{k+1} - 1 ) coins and the other kid has 1 coin.4. First Interchange:   - The kid with ( 2^{k+1} - 1 ) coins gives ( 2^{k+1} - 1 ) coins to the other kid. After the first interchange, the distribution of coins is:     [     left( 2^{k+1} - 1 - (2^{k+1} - 1), 1 + (2^{k+1} - 1) right) = (0, 2^{k+1})     ]   - Now, the kid with 0 coins cannot give any coins, so the interchange stops.5. General Case:   - For any ( n ), the number of interchanges is limited by the fact that after each interchange, the number of coins each kid has is divisible by ( 2^k ). Therefore, the maximum number of interchanges is ( n ).6. Example for ( n = 3 ):   - Suppose we have ( 2^3 = 8 ) coins.

The probability that Mike wins in exactly 3 games is equal to the probability that Mike wins the second game, which is frac{1}{2}, multiplied by the probability that Mike wins the third game, which is also frac{1}{2}.That is, the probability that Mike becomes the champion by winning the first 3 games is frac{1}{2} times frac{1}{2}=frac{1}{4}.Of the six ways that Mike can win, two of these end after 4 games (MMAM, MAMM).The probability that Mike wins games two and four but Alain wins game three (MMAM) is equal to the probability that Mike wins the second game, which is frac{1}{2}, multiplied by the probability that Alain wins the third game, which is also frac{1}{2}, multiplied by probability that Mike wins the fourth game, frac{1}{2}.In this case, Mike becomes the champion with probability frac{1}{2} times frac{1}{2} times frac{1}{2}=frac{1}{8}.Similary, the probability that Mike becomes the champion by winning games three and four, but loses game two, is also frac{1}{2} times frac{1}{2} times frac{1}{2}=frac{1}{8}.Finally, we determine the probabilty that Mike becomes the champion by winning in exactly 5 games (there are three possibilities: MMAAM, MAMAM and MAAMM).Each of these three possibilities happens with probability frac{1}{2} times frac{1}{2} times frac{1}{2} times frac{1}{2}=frac{1}{16}.Therefore, if Mike has won the first game, then the probability that he becomes champion is frac{1}{4}+2 times frac{1}{8}+3 times frac{1}{16}=frac{1}{4}+frac{2}{8}+frac{3}{16}=frac{4+4+3}{16}=frac{11}{16}.ANSWER: (C)"},{"problem":"## Task 4 - 270824A cube W is divided into volume-equal smaller cubes.

We will use the additional notations from the diagram. It is obvious that a circle with radius 3r centered at O contains all five circles, but a circle with a radius smaller than 3r centered at O does not suffice. We will show that a circle with a radius smaller than 3r and a different center also does not work. Consider, for example, the sector O_{1} O O_{2}. This angle is at least 60^{circ}, and since there are three more such sectors, it is not greater than 180^{circ}. Suppose there exists a point O^{prime} such that a circle with a radius smaller than 3r can be drawn around it, containing all five circles.

Suppose for now that O^{prime} is an interior point of this sector. This sector is not adjacent to the sector F_{1} O F_{4} varangle, which, according to the previous, is not greater than 180^{circ}. Therefore, F_{4} O O^{prime} varangle + F_{1} O O^{prime} varangle geq 180^{circ}, so one of these two angles is at least a right angle. Suppose F_{1} O O^{prime} geq 90^{circ}. Then in the triangle F_{1} O O^{prime}, F_{1} O^{prime} is the largest side, and since F_{1} O = 3r, F_{1} O^{prime} > 3r. This is a contradiction.Now consider the case where O^{prime} lies on one of the sides of the sector it contains. Without loss of generality, we can assume that O^{prime} in O F_{2}. If F_{4} O F_{2} varangle = 180^{circ}, then O^{prime} F_{4} > O F_{4} = 3r. If F_{4} O F_{2} varangle neq 180^{circ}, then in the triangle F_{4} O O^{prime}, the angle F_{4} O O^{prime} varangle is at least 120^{circ}, so the side F_{4} O^{prime} is the largest, and again F_{4} O^{prime} > F_{4} O = 3r.

Since a > 2, it implies a-2 > 0. This is important because it ensures the denominator in our fraction is positive, allowing us to manipulate the expression safely.2. We can rewrite the expression by adding and subtracting 2 within the first term:   a+frac{4}{a-2} = (a-2) + 2 + frac{4}{a-2}.3. We recognize that (a-2) and frac{4}{a-2} can be seen as two terms that can be related by the AM-GM inequality (Arithmetic Mean - Geometric Mean Inequality). Specifically, the AM-GM inequality tells us that for any positive real numbers x and y, the arithmetic mean is greater than or equal to the geometric mean, i.e., frac{x+y}{2} geqslant sqrt{xy}, with equality if and only if x = y.4.

The spherical distance between two points on the sphere is the length of the shortest arc of a great circle connecting these points.","solution":"Answer: 32 pi, i.e., half the area of a sphere with radius 4.Solution. Since angle B C D+angle B D C=angle A C D+angle A D C=90^{circ}, triangles B C D and A C D are right triangles with a common hypotenuse C D. If O is the midpoint of segment C D, then by the property of the median of a right triangle, O A=O B=O C=O D=4. Therefore, the radius of the circumscribed sphere is 4, and point O is its center.Let d(X, Y) denote the spherical distance between points X and Y.

Inequality (1) can be rewritten asd(M, A)+d(M, B) leqslant 4 piLet B_{1} be the point symmetric to point B with respect to the center of the sphere O. Since B_{1} and B are the endpoints of the diameter of the sphere, d(B, M)+dleft(M, B_{1}right)=dleft(B, B_{1}right)=4 pi.

Check divisibility by 3:   For ( 3a^2k + 3ak^2 + k^3 ) to be divisible by ( 3^2 = 9 ), we need ( k ) to be divisible by 3. This is because:   [   3a^2k + 3ak^2 + k^3 = 3k(a^2 + ak + frac{k^2}{3})   ]   For this to be divisible by 9, ( k ) must be divisible by 3.4. Check divisibility by 223:   We need ( 3a^2k + 3ak^2 + k^3 ) to be divisible by 223.

This is equivalent to finding ( k ) such that:   [   k(3a^2 + 3ak + k^2) equiv 0 pmod{223}   ]   Since ( 223 ) is prime, ( k ) must be divisible by 223 for the product to be zero modulo 223.5.

Then we have (n^{3p^2} equiv n pmod{p^2}) for all (n in mathbb{Z}). If we take (n = p), we get:   [   p^{3p^2} equiv p pmod{p^2} implies p^{3p^2 - 1} equiv 1 pmod{p^2}   ]   This implies:   [   p^{3p^2 - 1} equiv 1 pmod{p}   ]   Since (p^{3p^2 - 1} equiv 0 pmod{p}), we get (0 equiv 1 pmod{p}), which is a contradiction.

Initial Observations:   - If ( k ) is a single-digit number, then ( s(11k) = 2s(k) ), which is a contradiction because ( s(11k) ) would be the sum of the digits of a two-digit number.   - If ( k ) has two digits, then ( s(101k) = 2s(k) ), which is again a contradiction because ( s(101k) ) would be the sum of the digits of a three-digit number.   - If ( k ) has three digits, then ( s(1001k) = 2s(k) ), which is also a contradiction because ( s(1001k) ) would be the sum of the digits of a four-digit number.2. Considering Four-Digit ( k ):   - Let ( k = a_3a_2a_1a_0 ) (where ( a_i ) are the digits of ( k )).   - We need ( s(1001k) = s(k) ). Writing ( 1001k ) as ( a_3a_2a_1a_0 cdot 1001 ), we get:     [     1001k = a_3a_2a_1a_0 cdot 1001 = a_3a_2a_1a_0 + 0a_3a_2a_1a_0     ]     This implies that the sum of the digits of ( 1001k ) must be equal to the sum of the digits of ( k ).3. Analyzing the Sum of Digits:   - For ( k = 9999 ):     [     s(9999) = 9 + 9 + 9 + 9 = 36     ]   - For any ( a ) with at most four digits, ( 9999a ) can be written as:     [     9999a = a_3a_2a_1a_0 cdot 9999 = a_3a_2a_1a_0 cdot (10000 - 1) = a_3a_2a_1a_0 cdot 10000 - a_3a_2a_1a_0     ]     This results in a number where the sum of the digits is:     [     s(9999a) = 36     ]     for any ( a ) with at most four digits.4. Verification:   - For ( k = 9999 ), we need to show that ( s(ak) = 36 ) for all ( a = 1, 2, ldots, 2014 ).   - If ( a = a_3a_2a_1a_0 ) (with ( a_3 ) possibly zero), then:     [     9999a = a_3a_2a_1a_0 cdot 9999 = a_3a_2a_1a_0 cdot (10000 - 1)     ]     This results in:     [     s(9999a) = 36     ]     for all ( a ) with at most four digits.Thus, the smallest positive integer ( k ) such that ( s(k) = s(2k) = cdots = s(2014k) ) is ( k = 9999 ).The final answer is ( boxed{9999} )."},{"problem":"8.
