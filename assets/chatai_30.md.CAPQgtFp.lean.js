Bronchitis causes bronchospasm and this in turn causes chest pain, chest tightness, breathing difficulty etc. So consult pulmonologist and get done clinical examination of respiratory system and PFT (Pulmonary Function Test). You need to start inhaled bronchodilator (formoterol or salmeterol) and inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) (budesonide or fluticasone).

The good news is , if detected in early stage, it can be completely cured with the right choice of antibiotic .I would prefer to start you on antibiotics like amoxyclav and azithromycin to start with , which generally work well for community acquired pneumonia.  Before the first dose of antibiotic, I would suggest you send a sample of your early morning phlegm for gram stain and culture sensitivity (the test that detects which organism has caused your phlegm to get infected and also tells which antibiotic will work to kill that organism ). As far as your pain is concerned , it seems to be a musculoskeletal pain . The pounding heart is also mostly likely due to the pain. So taking analgesics, hot compress and physiotherapy should help.

Since you are not improving with albuterol and also have chest tightness and pressure, better to rule out cardiac cause for your symptoms. So get done ecg, 2d echo and stress test. You may need diuretics and other cardiac supportive drugs. Don't worry, you will be alright but first rule out heart diseases. Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further. Wish you good health. Thanks."},{"Patient":"Hi. I am a 40 year old female diagnosed with Idiopathic Pulmonary Hypertension a year ago, and recently diagnosed with Giant Cell Hepatitis through a liver biopsy.  All autoimmune factors tested negative, negative Hepatitis Virus results, negative HIV.  What should I expect as far as treatment and prognosis, and what questions should I ask my Dr.?  Thank you.","Doctor":"Hello! First and foremost I would like to tell you what pulmonary hypertension(PH) means.  It is the raise in blood pressure of the vessels within your lungs.  There are various causes for PH - mainly heart diseases, chronic lung diseases, chronic pulmonary embolism , connective tissue diseases, interstitial lung diseases like sarcoidosis . Only if no such cause for Pulmonary hypertension is found then it is termed as Idiopathic Pulmonary hypertension.  The most crucial thing is to ensure all tests are done to rule out these known causes of PH before stamping as Idiopathic co the treatment is entirely different. So pls do discuss with your physician regarding your diagnosis. Presuming you have been diagnosed right, treatment of IPAH (Idiopathic Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension) requires significant patient education regarding the available therapies and their potential complications.  Management is best to be undertaken at centres with expertise in treating this rare disease.  The drugs commonly used are calcium channel blockers , sildenafil, bosentan , prostacyclins.  these dilate the Pulmonary vessel and reduce the pressure.  As supportive measures anticoagulants, digoxin , diuretics, supplemental oxygen are prescribed in necessary cases.  A low sodium low fluid diet is recommended in patients with volume overload.  Single or double lung transplant is an option for patients who fail to respond to medical therapy.  As far as the prognosis is concerned , although IPAH is a generally progressive and fatal disease , its prognosis  is highly variable . Many patients characteristics correlate with prognosis including functional class, rapidity of onset and exercise capacity . Also there are various parameters of hemodynamic status of the patient and cardiac status that can predict the prognosis. There are occasional case reports which report patients to have survived for even 20 years with proper treatment . So kindly consult a qualified expert physician and get the right treatment ."},{"Patient":"Hello,  As of about noon (EST) today I have developed a pain in my upper right chest.  It hurts when I inhale.  I have not had a cold or the flu all winter.  I currently do not have a cold or flu.  No sore throat.  No sinus cold or drainage.  No cough.  No sputum.  No shortness o breath.  Just pain when I inhale.  I thought that it would go away but it seems to be getting more painful.  It is now 7:06 PM EST.","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on Healthcare Magic. I can understand your concern. Chest pain (worsening) during inhalation is commonly seen with pleurisy (inflammation of pleura). And most common cause for pleurisy is lung infection. So first get done chest x ray. If chest x ray is normal then no need to worry for pleurisy. Sometimes pulled muscle can be also cause similar kind of pain. So apply ice packs on affected areas. Avoid movements causing pain. Take combination of painkiller and muscle relaxant drugs. Don't worry, you will be alright with all these. Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further. Wish you good health.

You are having chronic cough (cough for more than 2 weeks). So we should definitely rule out pneumonia and bronchitis in your case. So better to consult pulmonologist and get done clinical examination of respiratory system, chest x ray and PFT (Pulmonary Function Test). Chest x ray is needed for pneumonia. PFT is must for the diagnosis of bronchitis. You may need antibiotics, inhaled bronchodilators (formoterol or salmeterol) and inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) (budesonide or fluticasone).

Does your cough worsening on lying down ? Do your have Allergic symptoms like running nose , nasal blockade, sneezing ? Cough can signify issues from your throat down to lungs to reflux disease. If your cough is recent onset n get phlegm it s likely due to respiratory infection in which case a proper course of antibiotic will suffice.  Do consume warn fluids and do warm saline gargle . You can also get betadine gargle solution and add few drops to one glass lukewarm water and gargle with this solution for symptomatic relief.  If however your cough persists despite completion of antibiotic course you will need a further evaluation with chest x ray and Chest and ENT specialist consultation .

In addition they found some \\"spots\\" in the right lower lobe of my right lung.  These spots continue to grow.  A needle biopsy was attempted but the radiologist could not reach them with the needle.  Could this be related to Evans syndrome or something unrelated entirely?","Doctor":"Hello ! Evans syndrome does have increased for thrombosis (blood clots). With your clinical background , the multiple clots in lungs were reported as pulmonary emboli? Was it detected on plain CT or CTPA (CT Pulmonary Angiogram)? CTPA is the best modality to detect pulmonary emboli. Consult a physician and get autoimmune profile tests of blood done - like Anticardiolipin antibody, lupus anticoagulant, Antiphospholipid antibody , beta 2 glycoprotein antibody coz presence of any these is associated with increases risk of abnormal clotting in blood vessels.  Also the spot in the lower lobe of  your right lung can be due to infection or lung tumour.  Kindly consult a chest specialist and take opinion in person . Despite antibiotic and antifungal medications, if the spot continues to grow , it is a concern.  so it is essential to grow for bronchocoscopy and CT guided biopsy of the \\"growing spot\\" .

They have taken exrays and my lungs look fine,  Is the gurgling sounds mucos moving in my lungs??","Doctor":"Hello ! In patients with COPD, the airways gets inflamed (swell up and produce more mucus) hence the when air moves through these constricted airways it can cause these sensations like you described.Secondary infection can make it worse.  Taking adequate bronchodilator medications, antibiotics will help in this situation.   In many patients with COPD there can be associated bronchiectasis (abnormal dilation of airways due to permanent damage) can be there and so much can get stagnated in those dilated portions and get infected. Early bronchiectasis might not be evident on chest x ray. .So review with you chest physician and if clinically indicated discuss with them the need to proceed for a HRCT (High resolution CT) of your chest to see whether there are bronchiectatic changes in your lungs.  Kindly go for chest physiotherapy as well .. it helps to bring out the stagnant phlegm out from your lungs ."},{"Patient":"3 weeks ago I had a large mole on my back removed, which was discovered to be a malignant melanoma.

I understand breathing difficulties can be associated with the cancer spreading into the lungs, however I would have assumed this would occur in a later stage and I would be experiencing other symptoms?I do also have a sore throat and minor swelling bellow my jaw, so it's entirely possible I just have a \\"cold\\".

By your history and description, possibility of post infectious bronchitis is more likely for your breathlessness. Bronchitis is very common after viral upper respiratory tract infection (URTI). So drink plenty of fluids orally and keep yourself hydrated. Do warm water gargles 5-6 times a day. You will mostly improve with all these. Since you are also having malignant melanoma, pulmonary involvement should be looked for. So if your breathlessness is not improving in 3-4 days, make an early appointment with your oncologist and get done CT thorax to see whether lungs are involved or not. Hope I have solved your query.

Could these symptoms be related?","Doctor":"Hello! you seem to have Bronchial Asthma which is an allergic response of your airways to cold, dust and other allergens . The airways temporarily constrict and make it difficult for air to move in and out of your lungs , making you feel a tightness around your chest.  The mainstay for treatment is bronchodilator and steroid medications in inhaled form - either pressurised MDI (metered dose inhaler) or rotacaps.  The dosage needs to be decided after eliciting detailed history and examining you.  If too severe you might be prescribed a short course of oral steroid.  Do steam inhalation, warm saline gargle, protect yourself from cold, dust and other allergens.  Consume only warm fluids.before initiating treatment your doctor would prefer to get a complete blood count with Absolute Eosinophil Count (the cells that increase in response to allergy)  , Chest x ray to rule out other causes of your breathlessness, EKG to ensure your heart s working fine and a Spirometry pre and post bronchodilator medication ."},{"Patient":"We are seeing a Pulmonologist tomorrow for my father who was diagnosed with Pulmonary Fibrosis. I was wondering if there are any questions that we should be asking when we see her tomorrow. This will be an initial visit after a CT scan and Pulmonary function test.","Doctor":"Hello ! Pulmonary Fibrosis is a broad term . It can indicate a healed scar in the lung (most commonly due to treated TB in India) or it can indicate what is medically termed Interstitial Lung Disease (ILD) .. In the former (post infective fibrosis) it is not a progressive disease. the latter (ILD) encompasses about 200 different causes of fibrosis and it most cases it can be progressive.  So the first thing that you should be asking your Consultant is what variety of fibrosis your parent has got and what is the exact diagnosis.  coz the treatment for various ILD is different.  If there is any identifiable environmental or work related factor that has initiated the fibrosis then further avoidance of the factor is of utmost importance.  For few varieties of ILD steroid works while in few it doesn't.  So ask for the exact diagnosis , it's extent of involvement in the lungs (whether localised or extensive , one lung or both the lungs), Ask for what all investigations need to be done to find out what ILD your parent has got, discuss the currebt status, treatment options and prognosis.  Ask for any lifestyle change that you need to incorporate.  Some ILDs can be a manifestation of systemic disease so discuss whether it s the case in your parent , in which case the involvement of other organs also need to be investigated for in detail and treated."},{"Patient":"the pulmonologist found something wrong with my lungs he is suggesting an open lung biopsy to determine if it is rhuematory lung, sarcoidosis or basal cell lung cancer. is this test the only tests to detemine which of t he three ? he is leaning toward rhuematory lung disease due to bllod work that shows elevated levels, but the rhuemotologist doesn t think it is such so wont treat me. what other test can be done to determine rhuemotory lung disease?","Doctor":"Hello! Rheumatoid arthritis is diagnosed based on clinical presentation of inflammatory  arthritis involving three or more joints in your body. The blood tests which help in diagnosis are Rheumatoid factor , Anti - CCP (cyclic citrullinated peptide), ESR (Erythrocyte sedimentation Rate) and CRP (C reactive protein). Blood test that helps in diagnosing sarcoidosis is Serum ACE (Angiotensin Converting Enzyme)level . Rheumatoid Arthritis is an autoimmune disease (the body reacts against it's own tissues and damages them )so it can affect lungs as well and not just be restricted to your joints.  The various common manifestations of rheumatoid lung are interestial lung disease (ILD) , pleural effusion or thickening , inflammation of airways or blood vessels of the lung , rheumatoid nodule . There is also increased risk of respiratory infection due to immunosuppressant drugs prescribed for Rheumatoid.. Sometimes the drugs used for treatment of rheumatoid themselves can be toxic to your lung and cause damage.  Hence this needs careful evaluation . So the lung lesion can indicate any of the problems mentioned above.  If on clinic radiological correlation , it does seem obvious that the lesson is due to your rheumatoid, then treatment of rheumatoid will help in the resolution of your lung lesion as well . If however there is doubt regarding the cause for your lung lesion then it would be better to sample the tissue from the affected area in the lung and study it under the microscope and arrive at the diagnosis.  For tissue sampling open lung biopsy , though the best , is not the only option .U can discuss with your Consultant in person regarding feasibility of a bronchoscopy guided biopsy or CT guided biopsy instead of open lung biopsy ."},{"Patient":"I have had 2 episodes of pulmonary embolisms in the past.

Pulmonary embolism is a medical EMERGENCY ! it happens when there is abnormal blood clots in the blood vessels of the lungs , which can be fatal if untreated or improperly be treated.  The drugs used to treat are anticoagulants (blood thinners) . It is the critical balance between the pro and anti coagulant status of your body that is manipulated with the blood thinners and hence too less or too much of these drugs is highly dangerous.Too much can cause bleeding from various blood vessels even vessels in your brain .So Kindly Refrain from self medication at this point.  The dose of anticoagulant needs to be carefully titrated based on the values of blood tests termed PT (Prothrombin time) INR (International normalised ratio) . It is essential to repeat these tests every 2-3 days once to ensure safe dosing off the drugs by physician.  So it is extremely dangerous to self medicate . Dosage of CHF drugs also needs to decided by physician . Restricting fluid and salt intake is also required in management of CHF."},{"Patient":"Hi...

The common symptoms suggestive of TB are cough for more than 2 weeks duration not subsiding with routine antibiotics, fever with evening rise in temperature , bloody sputum (henoptysis), loss of appetite n loss of weight.  Did your friend have any of these symptoms ? If yes then definitely investigations to rule out or rule in TB have to be proceeded with . Also two things need to be kept in mind.  One , not always chest x ray show some abnormality in TB.  If there is minimal lesion then only a HRCT chest can pick it up and it can be missed on chest x ray.  Two, Since TB is common in India, at times , other diseases are wrongly diagnosed to be TB .

Would like to get your opition for the same.","Doctor":"Hello, you mentioned you have difficulty swallowing solids and liquids . Is it really only for past 2 days or u had difficulty even before that ? Do u really feel that your food gets stuck when it finds it's way down your throat or food pipe and isn't going down properly as it used to  ? Is it like initially you had difficulty swallowing solids and then it progressed to difficulty in swallowing liquids as well or it happened for both solids and liquids at once ?Did you have any episodes of vomiting ? Is there pain during swallowing or only difficulty ? What's your age? Any addiction to smoking or alcohol ? Do you have any other respiratory complaint apart from the chest pain you mentioned ? Your symptoms need detailed evaluation . Difficulty in swallowing can be due to issues with your throat or food pipe or something compressing on your food pipe from outside (example - enlargement of lymph nodes around your food pipe or any other growth ) or it can be due to motility disorders of your food pipe (Achalasia cardia) . There are many possibilities so I would suggest you consult a physician in person ."},{"Patient":"hello got an question i feel a lot of times cold dizzy i am shivering also got the caughing en breathing problems and problems with the stomach and i am blocked i use pausedal and it helps a bit but i keep on cauging it hurts my chest can u help me i am also very tired and a lost of hearing","Doctor":"Hello! Sounds like you have Allergic response to cold - Allergic rhinitis and Bronchial Asthma . The former(allergic rhinitis) is allergic response from your upper respiratory tract coz of which your eustachian tube (auditory tube which has one of it's opening behind the nose and the other opening into the ear ) might have got blocked making you feel some loss of hearing.  Bronchial asthma is allergic response from your lower respiratory tract (windpipe and airways) which causes your airways to constriction temporarily on exposure to cold, dust, pollen or any allergen.  this construction of airways makes it difficult for the air that u breathe in and out to move along . Also these airways swell up as a part of the allergic response producing more mucus , thus causing more cough n phlegm . Do your sypmtoms typically increase after exposure to such allergens I have mentioned ? Is this the first episode or u have had similar episodes in the past too ? Anybody else in your family had similar complaints .. coz since there s a genetic component to allergy , the presence of similar complaints in your parents / grandparents / other family members makes bronchial asthma with allergic rhinitis more likely . As far as your stomach symptoms are concerned , many patients with asthma also have this reflux disease (medically called GERD). For symptom relief you will need steam inhalation  antihistamine/ decongestant medication for allergic rhinitis . For Bronchial Asthma, based on physician assessment of your asthma severity , Inhaled bronchodilator drugs (that help dilate the constricted airways) and steroids (to reduce the inflammation in the airways) will be used. Refrain from taking cold drinks and exposure to cold, dust, Do warm saline gargle four times daily . Do consult a physician in person for complete evaluation."},{"Patient":"hi i went too the doctors three weeks ago now with exsesive burping and a constaint itergetion type pain in my chest he gave me a two week course of omeprazole which stoped the problem just over a week since i finished the medication the problem has now come back. any ideas ??","Doctor":"Hello! Your description is highly suggestive of GERD (Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease). Since your food pipe is located anatomatically in the mid of the chest , this reflux causes chest pain . You were rightly prescribed omeprazole.  Do avoid spicy food, caffeine . Have your head end elevated with two pillows while sleeping . Have your dinner 2 hours before bedtime.  Consult a gastroenterologist if your symptoms persist despite medications . They might go for an endoscopy and biopsy.  If there is infection with H. pylori (a bacteria) that is causing your symptoms you will prescribed a course of necessary antibiotics ."},{"Patient":"Hi, Basically I was on a plane earlier this week travelling home, when I got a funny feeling in my chest. At first i thought it was a heart attack, but as I didn't collapse or get any ther symptoms, I presummed not. The problem has persisted, and it feels like a shortness of breath and tightness in my chest. I read up on the problem, and it says it could be a collapsed lung, or Primary spontaneous pneumothorax. I read the cause, and it says it is common in males, young, smokers and can start from a change in atmospheric pressure. I am 21, male, a smoker (sorry, I know, trying to give up), and the plane would explain this. I was wondering if you could give me some advice, as I don't really have lots of free time to visit a doctors, as I have a disserttation in in 2 weeks. Thanks!","Doctor":"Hello ! Yes pneumothorax is definitely one of the possibilities . However it is not the only possiblity.  Since you mentioned shortness of breath and chest tightness, even bronchial asthma is a possibility.  Have your ever had similar episodes in the past ? Problems related to your heart cannot be ruled out just coz you din't collapse. The oxygen levels drop in the higher altitude so your shortness of breath could have been a response to that as well.You need to be examined by a physician in person . You will need a Chest X ray , ECG , Spirometry (pre and post bronchodilator) for basic cardiorespiratory evaluation.  Treatment needs to be decided based on your final diagnosis . Do not miss to consult coz if it's a pneumothorax(air getting collected around your lungs) it needs to be drained. So do book an appointment with your physician at the earliest.Do quit smoking too ! Your health needs priority."},{"Patient":"blood preasure 172 over 90, i would imagine should go to doctor. would this give headach? as well as tired and have had chest pain coming from bottem of shoulder left side sometimes quite sever into left side chest. has been happening for a few years off and on. ekg good.","Doctor":"Hi since your pressure is quite high (170 systolic) it sometimes can cause increase in pressure in your cranium and cause headache . So consult a physician to get the right choice of antihypertensives for you and if your headache persists despite control of BP , do get yourself evaluated for it's cause - anything from stress to vision problem to migraine can cause headache.  there are several possibilities . As for your chest pain it definitely needs attention. Go for a Chest X ray PA and left lateral view , echocardiography, Ultrasound abdomen .  Do you have any abdominal pain ? Do u consume too much alcohol ? Based on ur symptoms I feel  your descending aorta (the major blood vessel that carries blood pumped from heart to lower half of the body) and pancreas need to be focussed upon . Do consult a physician in person."},{"Patient":"My husband is unable to breathe at night. He has tried Advair and other types of asthma medicine and they have all failed. He has resorted to drinking because that works, unfortunately. He has developed a tolerance and now drinks a 15 pack and half a liter of vodka to breathe. He also gets nauseous and vomits once a day usually soon after eating, that started about two weeks ago. If he does fall asleep, it last a couple hours and he wakes up gasping for air, but he can't get any so he stays up miserable. Also, he describes it as slowly suffocating because it feels like an overweight man is sitting on his chest. What could this be? He is only 22.","Doctor":"Hello,One possibility apart from bronchial asthma is cardiac conditions (issues relating to the heart). The symptom of getting up from mid-sleep gasping for breath is medically termed as paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea. It can happen when the left side of your heart fails to pump blood properly, and it can also happen in severe asthma. Since your husband is an alcoholic, it can sometimes weaken the heart. As far as the treatment goes, the treatment for the two is entirely different as one (bronchial asthma) is a problem with the airways while left heart failure needs cardiac medications. You mention that he has taken appropriate medications for asthma. Can you please elaborate on the prescription so that it can be ensured? Do consult a physician in person at the earliest for complete cardiorespiratory evaluation. Alcohol consumption needs to be quit.Hope I have answered your query.

I feel better in different areas too, unless they have heavy pollen or mold, etc.I guess I want to know if I have something other then allergies and what is the best I can do to feel better, OR if only time and winter will stop whatever.","Doctor":"Hello! It seems to be an allergic response at your lungs that is causing your problem . Most likely you seem to have Bronchial Asthma in which the chest feels tight as a result of the airways temporarily getting narrowed.  This attack happens whenever there is exposure to some allergen / cold/dust . I feel it's the feeling of chest tightness that you are describing as pain .Can you please tell if you feel short of breath ? Do u wheeze ? Cough and phlegm ? Coz if these associated symptoms are also there and they increase on exposure to dust / cold/ allergens like pollen then it makes asthma the most likely diagnosis.

My father has already had pulmonary embolism within the last three years and one year ago had multiple blood clots in both legs all the way from ankles up to kidney. He has had several procedures to remove these and is on anticoagulants. He recently has become very short of breath and he has told us that he is having nosebleeds. What is your opinion?","Doctor":"Hello! The nose bleed (medically termed epistaxis)cannot happen because of Pulmonary embolism per se. Embolism means there is clotting of blood in that blood vessel. While what your parent had experienced is bleeding (opposite of clotting ) Since you have mentioned that he is on anticoagulant medications (blood thinners) it is possible that these drugs have caused excessive thinking of blood than that was therapeutically aimed for in your father . Also it is possible that this nose bleed could have been initiated by some other cause and aggravated by the blood thinner medications.  In that case the underlying cause (may be hypertension or trauma to nose or anything else relevant )needs to be looked for and treated. While on the way to physician , to reduce the nose bleed, ask your father to pinch his nose for few seconds and lean forwards , application of ice packs can help constricting the leaking blood vessels and reduce bleed.  The doctor would do a nasal packing to control bleed . Get his blood pressure checked and INR testing done (accordingly the dose of anticoagulant needs to be adjusted)"},{"Patient":"It feels as thought the bottom half of my left arm is heavy.

Best treatment of pneumonia is identification of causative pathogen and start appropriate antibiotics. So get done sputum culture and sensitivity report. Culture report will isolate the causative organism and sensitivity report will guide about effective antibiotic treatment. So consult pulmonologist and discuss all these.

It literally takes my breath away and makes my heart race, then it eases off for awhile. I ve been debating on going to the ER as it keeps recurring. If it continues, should I go to the ER?","Doctor":"Hi i do care for your concern. Most of the times the pain in middle of chest and burning type suggest more of ulcer related pain. I would advise to  Start on antacid medication such as omeperazole low dose two times a day for two weeks. If the symptoms persist during the treatment then it is advisable to consult your physician and get an electrocardiogram done to rule out heart related causes. Hope your condition returns to normal. Hope i have answered your question, if you have more feel free to ask. Thank you."},{"Patient":"I have mild asthma. I have used Alvesco inhaler since my diagnosis 8 years ago, but my insurance no longer covers it. My PCP prescribed Symbicort but it says it is not for people whose asthma is well controlled by inhaled corticosteroids. It also says it increases risk of death...I am very nervous about using this Rx. Is there something else more appropriate?","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on Healthcare Magic. I can understand your concern.Alvesco is having ciclesonide. It is inhaled corticosteroid (ICS). It is good that your asthma is controlled by only ICS. Symbicort is having Salbutamol and fluticasone. Salmeterol is inhaled bronchodilator. Fluticasone is ICS. So no need for additional salmeterol when you are controlled with single ICS. So no need to take symbicort. In my opinion, you will be good with plain plain budesonide. Budesonide is also an ICS. And it is covered under insurance. So start plain budesonide 200micrograms twice daily. Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further. Wish you good health. Thanks."},{"Patient":"I have been experiencing increased shortness of breath with minimal activity.

Since your cardiologist consultation is normal, no need to worry for cardiac cause for your breathlessness. In my opinion, we should rule out pulmonary causes. So better to consult pulmonologist and get done clinical examination of respiratory system, chest x ray and PFT (Pulmonary Function Test). You may need inhaled bronchodilators (formoterol or salmeterol) and inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) (budesonide or fluticasone). Don't worry, you will be alright with appropriate treatment.

I was running fever for a few days but had very little cough but did have wheezing. Last week, I developed a dry cough and still wheezing, especially with activities like walking, going up or down stairs, etc. This week, I still have the same cough and wheezing as well as some shortness of breath. If this was a virus, should I go to the doctor?","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on Healthcare Magic. I can understand your concern. By your history and description, possibility of post infectious bronchitis is more likely. Bronchitis is very common after viral upper respiratory tract infection (URTI). Bronchitis causes bronchospasm and this in turn causes breathlessness, wheezing, cough etc. So consult pulmonologist and get done clinical examination of respiratory system and PFT (Pulmonary Function Test). PFT will not only diagnose bronchitis but it will also tell you about severity of the disease and treatment is based on severity only. You will mostly improve with inhaled bronchodilators (formoterol or salmeterol) and inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) (budesonide or fluticasone). Hope I have solved your query.

Considering the same diagnosis, prognosis is usually good, it recurs but not very common. Averagely it recurs once in 3 years. You should continue to have medical management and definitive treatment is electrophysiological studies and ablation which is successful in more than 80% patients.Hope I have answered your query.

Your all symptoms, left sided chest discomfort, irregular heart beats, breathlessness etc are more suggestive of heart diseases like coronary artery disease (CAD), arrhythmia, heart failure etc. So better to consult cardiologist and get done blood pressure monitoring, ecg, 2d echo and stress test (trade mill test). If all these are normal then no need to worry for heart diseases. Sometimes excessive stress, anxiety and panic disorder can also cause similar symptoms.

I normally weigh 128 lbs. but I lost 8 lbs. over the last fours weeks because I'm on an elimination diet (basically a vegan diet) to try and identify food triggers for my chronic migraines.  Three weeks ago I had horrible pains in my upper chest and back that I attributed to heartburn and that were somewhat relieved by TUMS.  Since then I have continued to have sensations of discomfort in my upper chest, something like your chest feels when doing exercise at high altitudes.  The discomfort is pretty constant and doesn't seem to coincide with eating.  A couple days ago I discovered a bony lump on the right side of my sternum, an inch or so below my collarbone.  It's about the size of a marble and it feels uncomfortable when pressed but not painful otherwise.  Is the lump related to the chest pain and should I have it checked?  When I breath in deeply, I feel the most discomfort at the top of my sternum and so I'm wondering if the lump is related?","Doctor":"It could possibly be related to this mass.  Sometimes, we can get bony non-malignant growths - osteomas (which is a new piece of bone growing from another bone).  This is usually benign, but can cause discomfort.  I would recommend a CT scan of your chest, and I'd have them scan your abdomen at the same time.  The other test I would recommend is an endoscopy, which can be done by a gastroenterologist.  Finally, a right upper quadrant ultrasound can look at your gallbladder and liver, and see if there are abnormalities (this would be lower on the list, as gallbladder pain is usually related to eating).  Hope this is helpful."},{"Patient":"Hi My dad had the following symptoms chest pains, fatigue and tiredness and both his arms hurt.  His Cholesterol and BP are normal but he is taking meds for them.  He also has heartburn/gerd and is taking meds for that.  and he is taking penicillin for a bacteria in his stomach.  Can this be signs of a heartattack or is the combinations of all the meds irritating his heartburn?","Doctor":"Hi there!I totally understand your concern for your father and commend you for looking out for him.  Usually, the signs and symptoms of a heart attack is a crushing chest pain (patients will often say that they feel like an elephant is sitting on their chest). If he has constant chest pain, a heart attack is possible, but less likely.   I'm not sure what bacteria he has, but taking penicillin for a stomach infection is unusual.  The only stomach infection that I am aware of that is treated by antibiotics is H. Pylori, and that is treated by a combination of antibiotics (and penicillin is not one of them).  Antibiotics tend to alter the flora of our GI tract (There are natural bacteria that live in the GI tract, and taking antibiotics can also kill the good bacteria).  I would ask the doctor who prescribed the antibiotic what exactly he is trying to treat (penicillin is a very unusual choice for GI infections, period).  I would also get him an EKG, which would check for any abnormalities going on with his heart.  I certainly do think that his medications could be playing a role. I'd recommend revisiting his medications and going over potential side effects with his doctor, especially the penicillin. I hope this helps.

Yes, this can still be malignant mass. What you had was not biopsy, it was FNAC (fine needle aspiration cytology). In FNAC, needle is inserted into the mass and material is taken. So material is not representing whole mass, it represents only small part of mass. So FNAC can be false negative if tumour cells are not aspirated.

And chest x ray is enough for screening of lung cancer. So if your chest x ray is normal, no need to worry for lung cancer. In my opinion, you should consult rehabilitation center for proper deaddiction. Your symptoms are more likely due to withdrawal of smoking and alcohol.

Smoking cessation, pulmonary rehabilitation, chest physiotherapy, deep breathing exercises are non pharmacological measures to halt progression. Perfinodone and N acetyl cystine (NAC) are the newer drugs for fibrosis. So consult pulmonologist and discuss all these. Prognosis is usually good if you follow all these things.

I m 30years old and have been living in Pattaya thailand for several years which has resulted in alot of drinking. I also remember getting a tight chest a couple of years back and when i stretch i expereinced a popping sensation across my rib cage (would come and go). The conclusion i have come to is that maybe i have had an enlarged liver (due to drinking) for quite sometime but haven t notice and carried on drinking, resulting in some sort of liver damage. Since having this pain 4 days ago, i have stopped drinking and gradually it feels like it getting slighty better. However i still cannot take a good breath and still its painful to touch, and this doesn t explain the lump in the centre of the chest. Any ideas?

Since you are having DVT (blood clot in leg), we should definitely rule out pulmonary embolism (PE - blood clot in lung) for your right sided chest pain.

It is anti angina drug and should be given only in cardiac chest pain. So we should first determine the cause for your chest twitching. So get done ecg, 2d echo and stress test.

I can understand your concern. No, you can not remove scars from lung. Any lung insult (tuberculosis, pneumonia) heal by fibrosis and calcification. They form Scar on healing.

Once wound infection is treated, Sinus will be healed and closed. Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further. Wishing good health to your father.

I can understand your concern. Yes, this can be symptoms of lung cancer. Since you are active smoker, your symptoms can be due to 1. Bronchitis 2. Lung infection (pneumonia) 3. Lung cancer. So consult pulmonologist and get done clinical examination of respiratory system, chest x ray and PFT (Pulmonary Function Test). Quit smoking as soon as possible. Treatment is based on diagnosis. So consult pulmonologist, diagnose yourself and start appropriate treatment. Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further. Wish you good health.

Reports says Mild diiuse airways dysfunction ,overinflation & air trapping are seen. Any side effects to using inhalers.","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on Healthcare Magic. I can understand your concern. No need to worry for side effects by inhalers. Actually inhalers are very safe in long term use. They act locally and directly on lungs without going to blood. So inhalers don't act on other organs like kidney, heart, liver etc. So no systemic side effects by inhalers. You should also rinse your mouth after inhaler use to prevent oral complications. Also do pulmonary rehabilitation (deep breathing exercises and chest physiotherapy) for better symptomatic relief. So don't afraid of long term inhaler use. They are safe. Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further. Wish you good health. Thanks."},{"Patient":"I had an upper back injury with pain that radiated around the chest on the left and then later it moved to radiate around to the right. Although this pain has gone i still have deep aches in the area of injury, and then developed left ventricular eptopics are they related?","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on Healthcare Magic. I can understand your concern. Your pain at injury site is mostly related to nerve damage at injury site. This can not cause ventricular ectopics. So you should consult cardiologist and get done ecg, 2d echo, stress test and Holter monitoring (24 hours continuous recording of Ecg) to identify the cause of ventricular ectopics. These investigations will also guide about treatment of ectopics. So consult cardiologist and discuss all these. Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further. Wish you good health. Thanks."},{"Patient":"hello doctor, my name is usman and i think so i am suffering from cystic fibrosis. i am experiencing breathing problem by birth as bronchitis. but from past year i am totally reliable on sabutamol inhalers. i am also experiencing transpaent thick cough which comes almost every minute. i have also digestion problem.Please suggest me some good treatment.","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on Healthcare Magic. I can understand your concern. Salbutamol is short acting beta 2 agonist (SABA). It is not for regular maintenance treatment. And this is the reason why your bronchitis is not controlled. So better to consult pulmonologist and get done clinical examination of respiratory system and PFT (Pulmonary Function Test). PFT will not only diagnose bronchitis but it will also tell you about severity of the disease and treatment is based on severity only. You will definitely improve with long acting inhaled bronchodilators (formoterol or salmeterol) and inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) (budesonide or fluticasone). Indigestion should also be treated simultaneously. So take pantoprazole and levosulperide combination on empty stomach. Don't worry, you will be alright with all these. Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further. Wish you good health.

I can understand your concern. Since her ecg is normal and she is young, no need to worry for heart diseases. In my opinion, she is having panic disorder. This is very common in teenage. So consult psychiatrist and get done counselling sessions. Try to identify stressor in her life. She may need anxiolytic drugs too. Don't worry, she will be alright with counseling and drugs.

I have been coughing a lot with the CHF, which causes me to go into and out of A-fib. Is there anything I can do to get back into sinus rhythm?","Doctor":"Hello,First the reversibility depends upon on size of Atria, if they are extensively enlarged then there is less possibility that you will maintain sinus rhythm for long. If not then other drugs like flecainide etc can be tried. You can discuss with your local doctor. Also, regarding ccf, I think you also need to be on diuretics like torsemide and spironolactone, which are important in ccf.  So you can discuss both these issues. In general you, you restrict your fluid and salt intake.Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further.

I can understand your concern. You are still having barking cough (frequency reduced), this means your bronchitis is not completely cured. Bronchitis needs treatment based on severity. And to know severity, PFT (Pulmonary Function Test) is must. So get done PFT and start treatment according to severity.

I can understand your concern. Left sided chest pain in patient with diabetes and hypothyroidism should be evaluated for heart diseases. So first get done ecg, 2d echo and stress test.

That went away but started to get a little diarrhoea, intense hunger and thirst (only 2 days or so) but still thirst, then shifting pains and cramps all around torso from under ribs all the way down to pubic area. Ongoing waves of cramping pains and waves of intense nausea that improves after food, but very little appetite and feel full after very little, I probably average 600 calories a day in food, (although I do drink wine daily and some drugs, cocaine, and occasional valium or a spliff.) A couple of times since the burning weeing Ive had intense heartburn and constant burping which is much less frequent now, and gas. Now lower back pain has started, again in waves. Fatigue has been majorly noticeable, and equally insomnia, which I have always had but its different now - I may not sleep for 4 days then sleep 17 hours. I never usually sleep more than 4 hours at best even after not sleeping a few days so this is unusual. I started taking Gedarel for about 6 or 7 weeks although inconsistently (due to side effects) of constant nausea and banging headaches (never ever usually get a headache) but had intercourse frequently until stopping it about a month ago and no intercourse since. Had full sexual health screen in july - all clear and had same partner since although he had 2 other partners whilst on a break. I cant say when last proper period was due to the interruption with the gedarel which i tried to run 2 packs , but did have a very light 1 and a half to 2 day bleed approx 25th nov, about 2 weeks after stopping. Had a few headaches and muscle aches since, but not from exercise as I m now finding myself breathless after very short exercise, previously I was cycling 10-20 miles a day and could run 5km no probs. Now I m shallow breathing and breathless after a flight of stairs. I do get very anxious and panicked and lately depressed/lethargic with major mood swings, my psychiatrist has given me Serlain, however I have not taken any yet due to feeling so strange of late. I was in therapy in august/september for anxiety and psychological/emotional abuse by my mother leading to anorexia about 10 years ago, depression and drink/drug problems, although despite that I still have more to go. I have lately been having unusual fluttering feelings throughout torso as well as the cramping and waves of racing heartbeat, and finding myself holding my breath subconsciously when concentrating on writing/reading/financial spreadsheets etc. Ive also felt random temperature fluctuations and one night woke in a sweat. Despite the nausea I have never actually vomited. The burning wee has popped up again since it went away a week or so ago. Today I have developed darker, orangey patches between each finger on my left hand and possibly vaguely on the right. I bruise easily and spots/ingrown hairs seem to take a long time to heal. I felt so unusual I thought when checking the symptoms on the web I may be pregnant but a home test yesterday was negative. I will have the set of STi tests again tomorrow plus my psychotherapist wants me to have to have adrenal stress tests and thyroid ( I m not overweight - 5 5 and 55kgs) and my psychiatrist has sent my GP things to check in a blood test for liver. Neither of them know about the above symptoms as they are recent (except the burning which had gone away) and they all come and go. I have a slight sore throat and nasal congestion but that may be substance related. I am rarely ill and my body is well adjusted to extremes and very hardy, so I notice these inconsistencies very quickly and they seem to be in waves. I think thats all the symptoms.","Doctor":"Respected user , HiThanks for using Healthcaremagic.comI have evaluated your query thoroughly .*  These all  are  in concern  with  psychosomatic manifestations of     underlying  stress  disorder  exacerbated  by  the abuse  substances .Hope this clears your long query .Welcome for further guidance .Regards ."},{"Patient":"i have a b one tht sticks out of my right side of my chest it hurts to exercise, breathe heavy or lie on my side when sleeping im 21, 55kg female this has been going on for about a year an had x-rays at the start but they showed nothing abnormal. there was no pain back then as there is alot now.","Doctor":"Respected user , HiThanks for using Healthcaremagic.comI have evaluated your query thoroughly .*  This seems in relation with costochondritis or ligament issue involving      intercostal spaces .*  Needs MRI  for the definite diagnosis &  management .Thanks .Regards ."},{"Patient":"i had 2 mini strokes .and a minor heart attack 5 weeks ago . also the doctor said that i had broncites and a infection next to my heart.took medacation and now i still have a cough that if i am lying on my right side i am ok . cought is bad when i stand lye on my left side or on my back.if i go out doors i get realy bad cough.latly i have minor sinus pain and pain in my right eye.","Doctor":"Respected user , HiThanks for using Healthcaremagic.comI have evaluated your query thoroughly .* Suggestions for better recovery from bronchitis -  Continue antibiotics and bronchodilator medicines as per guidance of    doctor-  Deep  breathing  exercises with YOGA are of tremendous help -  Walking in fresh air -  Avoid exposure to noxious substances , if necessary  fair use of mask -  Balanced nutritious  diet -  Avoid smoking ( active or passive )-  Regular follow up with the doctor Hope this helps you .Welcome for further guidance .Regards ."},{"Patient":"My 16 yr old son has been feelin chest pains & tightness in his chest n  throat for about a week now....hes also been very tired and headaches.

Liv K. Oslo","Doctor":"Thanks for your question on Healthcare Magic. I can understand your concern. No, lung related symptoms are different from Parkinson Disease. And Parkinson disease (PD)  is less likely to produce respiratory symptoms. Similarly, drugs used for PD is also unlikely to cause respiratory symptoms. So your lung nodules is mostly due to your smoking habit. So better to consult pulmonologist and get done repeat CT scan to compare size of nodules with previous CT scan. If size and numbers of nodules are similar then no need to worry for this. But if nodules are increasing in size or in numbers then you need to rule out malignant nodules. Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further. Wish you good health.

I have a big troubles. Everything started 10 years ago, when I was diagnosed with cancer, but lucky or unlucky, it was just a hernia. A year later, I started having problems like waking up in the middle of the night, cant breathe etc. Just an easy problems. After time, the things went wrong. I was affraid to go to a doctor, because I don't want to hear, that I am sick of Cancer. That is still the good part. Few Years later, I started having more serious problems. Currently, almost everyday at anytime I am in a different moods. Once I am happy, everything is fine, next minute I am depressed, and nothing is valuable to me. It happens after I lost one girlfriend though. But the problems are: 1. Cant focus on almost nothing2. Brain Fatigue3. Sleeping more then 8 hours and wake up tired.4. Always thinking of something in the past, cant concentrate on the present.5. Social Phobia - recently I found , that I am having it6. Hard time to organize my day. When I sleep less, like 4 hoursI am feeling more organized and easy going. But on the next day, I need to sleep more , like 10 hours and when I wake up, I am confused, stressed, tired, and the day is just passing by me.7. Sometimes, I am feeling, like I am out of my body and my life is just passing near myself.8. Avoiding reading documents and doing work, where brain is involved more then normal. That 's a big problem, because thequality of my life is getting worse and worse. Currently, I am 30 years old, finished my law school, but don't want to tell you how hard I took my exams, because, when I read something, I do forget it very fast9. It is hard for me to remember many things from my day. Everyday, I am not having many memories. For Example,not sure what I ate, not sure what movie I watched, not sure with whom and when I have a meeting. Cant organize myself, and the biggest problem ever is, that when I have all those symphoms, I start stearing in the mirrow and I see, that somehow, my eyeis changed. The way my eyes looks is a bit scary even for me. When I dont feel this pressure in my eye, they seems well, but often they skin where my eyelash is located is purple to red colour. this is only on one of my eye.10. Tired during the day. Need a sleep often in the early afternoon for at least 30 mins.11. Cant focus on many things, even if I want to. I would like to ask you, please, give me a clue, because when I go to doctor, everyone says, that I am ok, and this is just a depression. It is not, I am sure. I read forums, about Bipoliar Disorder, Concentration Disorder, and almost every desiase, I have the sympthoms.

It hurts to raise my arms, take deep breaths, lay on my back, stretch with my arms up and out. I can feel the pain constantly whether sitting or standing or lying down. It s pretty much feeling like I got punched in the chest all the time. I am certain it is not breast related. My ribs do not hurt except for that particular area. I cannot wear a bra or anything that will slightly squeeze the area as it causes a constant pain that feels like the area is a constant cramp. If i stand too long I get relief from hunching over as stretching the area just plainly feels like torture. In fact that s how I discovered the lump between my ribs. I have long hair so I put it up a lot and it s been painful to lift my arms to put it in a ponytail. I have noticed this pain for a while now. (Months) I ignored it because I blamed it on my back and the herniated discs I have. Three right around where my bra fastens in the back and three on the bottom L3-4 through L5-S1. Now it it unignorably painful and I realize it has nothing to do with my back. It feels like a tight gripping constant cramp in the middle of my chest right in my xiphoid process area. There s been no trauma or injury or explainable cause for this pain. There is a noticeable bump mostly hard it s about 3 or so inches long. I can t tell how wide. I ve had xrays and an ultrasound done within the last week and other than a small bit of fat on my liver (thats been there at least the last 16 years) there s nothing out of the ordinary to cause any concern. My doc has ordered a ct with contrast scan.im starting to feel like I am crazy but I m 100% certain I am in pain 24/7. I guess I m looking for any clues as to what the cause of the pain is.

He played college football for 5 years and just recently graduated. Last year during late summer, he was having difficulty breathing and started with terrible night sweats where he would totally saturate the bed and it was very foul smelling. The Football team doctor ordered a chest X.ray and other tests and then referred him to a Pulmonologist. He was then diagnosed with Cocidiodomycosis following a lung biopsy. He was treated with medication for approx. 4 months and a follow up CT Scan and he was feeling better so the doctor didn t feel he needed the medication any more. The night sweats started back again a few months ago and he went back to see the Pulmonologist, but he was told it was not related to his previous fungal lung infection because more tests came back normal. However, the Pulmonologist did make a notation that he recommended he see an Endochronologist which I was not aware of the notation until just recently. My son is still having night sweats about 2-3/wk and he also has spells of vomiting a couple times a week. Last night he woke up from a deep sleep and said he couldn t breath and then had projectile vomiting for what seemed about 10 minutes. He feels back to his normal self when he is done vomiting. He didn t know what had just happened and didn t remember voimiting all over the bed until he actually saw it. We are so puzzled by all of this. He just moved to Nashville and we are looking at getting him into a physician there to do a thorough work up. My son was also diagnosed with several allergies and acid reflux about 6 years ago.

The nurse informed me that she checked her oxygen and heartbeat and that everything looked fine. My daughter told me that this sharp pain, right in the middle of her chest, began after she was outside at recess, doing little activity; swinging on swings, when she came back into the classroom she felt her chest heavy and the pains started, so she went to take a drink of water (room temperature). This only made it worse and that is when she went to the nurse. I had her rest yesterday, and every so often she would say that her chest was hurting her. Other than that she was her normal self. This morning I had her stay home from school so I can keep an eye on her. So far she has been fine, only when she is in movement with deep breaths she complains saying, \\"ouch, my chest\\". I'm back and forth on what may be causing this and if I should be rushing her to the clinic. She seems ok in all other aspects.

Calcium deposits are small accumulations of calcium, which can accumulate anywhere in your body. These create bone spurs, kidney and gall stones, and, in the shoulder, tendonitis. Many calcium deposits don't require medical treatment (they can even be reabsorbed right back into your body). In the lungs, however, they can be a sign that you have a serious underlying condition that is causing them to form. While calcium deposits in the lung are usually benign (non-cancerous), they can become malignant. Calcium deposits should be monitored both to prevent cancer, and because many of the conditions that cause calcification are also serious."},{"Patient":"I've had tinnitus and flu like symptoms for months...After 2 blood tests my doctor advises me I have low white blood cell count and has since referred me to a hematologist.

It feels like I can't expand my chest properly. In addition i've had severe back, shoulder and neck pain accompanying this. For awhile i had tingling in my hands, feet and face, but this went away after awhile. Tests were negative for cancer, lupus, arthritis, and pericarditis. Chest Xrays were normal. Blood tests /did/ show severe anemia, but improving my diet by adding more red meat only stopped the tingling. Medication allergy was ruled out by taking me off them. Anxiety ruled out. Anti inflammatories and inhalers are NOT effective against it. Every doctor I've seen about this has been stumped. The sleep supplement Melotonin has actually been /very/ effective against it. But the supplement started causing rapid heart rate. Still, when i finished, the condition was 95 to 99 percent GONE. The most recent Doctor insists its asthma because he ordered a methocholine test. But the methocholine test made it WORSE. It caused an acute asthmatic reaction where i'd previously had NO history of asthma, undid /all/ the good done by the melatonin, and then made a bad situation worse. And the doctor REFUSES to believe that it /wasn't/ asthma causing the problem. Present in the place i was living at at the time were high amounts of bleach and ammonia based cleaners, dust, mice, insects. The woman I was renting a room from used easy off EVERY time she cleaned and the smell of the easy off, ammonia, lysol and bleach would cause a breathing reaction. In addition, she lent me something she said was a tylanol sleep aid, was marked as a sleep aid, but after things I went through with her i do NOT trust her anymore. Preexisting conditions:  Aspergers disorder, lypoma (benign fatty growth), Fibroma (benign fibrous growth), /extreme/ period pains, intestinal difficulties, dust allergies, wool allergies, occasional pet allergies, and hayfever. Family health problems that I don't have but are genetic to my mother and father include high cholesterol, diabetes, obesity, depression, and anxiety. Everyone i've seen has tried to make it seem like anxiety or attention seeking behavior, believing its all in my head when I'm in REALLY serious physical distress!  I need a list, something that I can look up and reference and BRING to my doctor.","Doctor":"Hello,Seems most likely due to decreased immunity of the lungs (due to chronic exposure to bleach and ammonia-based cleaners, dust). Neck pain has to do with pulling of musculature during strain but back pain is separate (muscular or other).

I experience constant sharp pain in the center f my chest. It is not indigestion/acid reflux - I had that once when I was eight. A couple years ago I felt this terrible sharp pain I think was a heart attack and it has made my breathing difficult ever since. Only recently (At least a couple months) my chest pain has been constant with it. My breaths are so short it induces yawning. The article on here said to do things like small short breaths and breathing through my nose but that makes me feel like I literally am going to suffocate for loss of air. I know I get major stress and do have anxiety. I told a doctor that and he told me I do not have anxiety. I literally had to argue with him to say that I do. He gave me a prescription which did nothing to help and only made it impossible to stay awake (and it was a narcotic) so I stopped taking it. He never put anxiety on my record. I used to think I might have asthma when I was younger because I could not run without feeling like I was no longer breathing. I am athletic and breath right. But the doctors told me I have perfect healthy lungs. They said there is nothing wrong with my heart and I often feel face or racing heart beat. Constant chest pain. I cannot breath or barely breath and small breaths makes it worse.

I also tingling sensation on the penis right after the exposure for about a week and had the same few weeks later. I got early detection tests done for HIV and herpes 32 hours post exposure - HIV came negative and herpes was equivocal. I have had 4-5 Hiv antibody tests done from then and all have been negative. I had one at 15th month HIV 3rd generation Antibody test (HIV-1 Antibody and HIV 1/O/2 Abs, Qual) which also came back negative. I have experienced chest pain, shortness of breath and chronic diarrhea and intermittent dry cough. Shortness of breath has been constant and I do not have any nasal congestion or sinus issues. I feel dull pain near my ribs, chest and abdomen when the breathing issue increases. My PCP has done EKG, chest xray and some blood tests and has no reasoning for this. I am so worried about this being HIV and it not showing up on my tests. I have read on forums that tests after 6 months are conclusive but these symptoms without explanation are terrifying. As of now, I have the following main symptoms 1. Chronic Diarrhea - been going on for more than 6 months now. Endoscopy done which didn t find anything. 2. Cottage cheese like whiteness on the tongue and redness on the inside upper mouth 3. Neck pain/stiffness I got another HIV test (HIV Screen 4th Generation wRfx) which was non-reactive and this test was done 2 years from the date of exposure. Searching medical sites suggests that there are cases where people are hiv positive but it doesn t get detected on tests for a long period of time as the tests are not 100% guaranteed (antibodies develop differently in different people). I am worried if I am one of those people as I have so many symptoms with no medically explainable reason behind them. What are the chances of me having it without it turning up in the tests that have been done so far?

It just keeps coming back to me every few weeks as my symptoms are just not ready to go away.

It is starting to go away now, but a week and a half ago I started feeling some pain just below my left breast when I breathed deeply or coughed.  At first I thought it was just heartburn, but it never went away.  The next day I was having a coughing fit and I felt and heard a pop in my rib cage and had excruciating pain (lower than the prior pain) that felt like something was out of place.  It took several hours before it felt like it was back in place, but for the next 2-3 days I was in a lot of pain.  I went to a walk in clinic and the NP gave me a z-pack (which didn't seem to help much with my cough) and told me I could take 4 ibuprofen every 8 hours which helped drastically.  However, Monday and Tuesday I tried to work out - doing exercises that did not hurt the injured area - and Wednesday we were unpacking boxes from our move.  I guess I irritated it b/c It has been hurting a lot again and the ibuprofen only does so much.  It is a constant pain that increases with deep breaths, certain movements, stretching, and lifting with my left arm.

How can this be treated?","Doctor":"Hello welcome to HCM. Pulmonary hyperaereation means the the amount of air in his lungs is more than it should be normally. This leads is due to air trapping in which all air he inhales is not exhaled out since the airways collapse at half of exhalation process. This leads to air trapping and hyperaeration. This may be a sequelae of old pulmonary TB which caused residual damage to the lungs. So he doesn't not have active tuberculosis but he is suffering from its after effects. There should be no problem to secure a job based on this chest x ray. Next he should stop smoking if he does smoke. I recommend a pulmonary function test which requires the patient to blow into a machine and helps to estimate the functional capacity of the lungs. Based on the results of pulmonary function tests, treatment can be started if it is abnormal. At present if he is asymptomatic there is no need of any medixations or treatment. Wishing you good health. Regards"},{"Patient":"What is the advisability of exercise in the year following treatment with Levofloxaxin for pneumonia? I just completed 5 days of treatment with pills after 4 or more days of IV in the hospital following gall bladder surgery. I entered the hospital with pneumonia (not knowing I had it), probably having contracted it from my brother who had it and whom I had visited several days earlier in another hospital. I am 71 years old, female; I had a non-heart damaging heart attack in 2003 and have tried to maintain a good exercise program to lessen my chances of worsening heart disease. Should I resume Naproxen for joint/muscle pain; had 2 doses (2 tablets twice daily) 2 days before hospitalization. Did not need it the 3rd day and was hospitalized the next day. Did not take it post hospitalization. Do not remember if they gave it in hospital; think not. Thank you.","Doctor":"Hello welcome to HCM. I have gone through your history. You have been adequately treated for your pneumonia and I suppose you don't have any symptoms of pneumonia like cough, fast breathing, fever, breathlessness. Since you have received intravenous plus 5 days of oral antibiotics, now you can resume about your exercise regime. As you say you had a non damaging heart attack, means that your heart pumping function is well preserved. So you must not have any issues with exercise. With every lung infection the lung capacity decreases by some percentage proportional to he severity of the infection. Hence along with your routine exercises you must also undergo breathing exercises with incentive spirometry, inhaling deeply through one nose holding your breath and exhaling fully from the other nose, meditation and yoga. This will help you to regain some of the lost lung capacity. You should also get vaccinated with influenza and pneumonia vaccines that include common strains which cause pneumonia Remember they don't protect you against all pneumonias but offer protection against common pneumonias.Regarding Naproxen too much of it may cause damage to your kidneys so I advice you decrease its usage and use it only when required rather than a daily basis.Wishing you good health. Regards"},{"Patient":"a few days ago i was taking a vitamin just as i was ending a conversation and it felt as though it did not travel down my throat but possibly down my windpipe? I'm just wondering what would be the possible effects of if i were to have aspirated the vitamin into my lung?","Doctor":"HelloWelcome to HCM. I have gone through your description. You have mentioned that you felt the vitamin pill not going down your thrust but into your wind pipe. Did you have any symptoms during that. Any food or foreign body that goes into the lungs causes a very severe cough during the episode. This is a defence mechanism of the lungs to protect against aspiration of foreign bodies. The cough persists for sometime and if the thing is not expelled with cough then it settles down blocking one of the smaller airways. This may lead to chronic cough, recurrent infection and pneumonia. If it blocks the smaller airways, and there is recurrent pneumonia then it can be removed with the help of a procedure called Bronchoscopy which removes the aspirated body under video guidance. As in your case you have not mentioned any severe cough while swallowing the pill or any chronic cough or recurrent lung infection thereafter, I do not suspect that you have aspirated the pill into your windpipe. So unless you had the above symptoms there is not much to worry about. Wishing you good healthRegards"},{"Patient":"sir I am taking wysolone 60 mg for the past 5 days for sorcoidosis which affected my vision.

I have noted your history. Your tiredness may be related to the steroid use. steroids cause osteoporosis or weakening of the bones by removing calcium from the bones. Long term use of steroids cause vit D deficiency and calcium deficiency. Vit D deficiency can cause fatigue and tiredness. I suggest you check your vit D and calcium levels. If they are low, you can be started on supplements. Usually people on long term steroids are on calcium, vit d supplements and bone protectors like bsphosphonates. I suggest along with the steroids you take these medications too.Wishing you good health Regards"},{"Patient":"Hi,My father is 66 years old with two stents placement an year ago. He had his regular quarterly checkup done fortnight ago where cardiologist said he s fine and his BP usually stays below 140/85 for the last couple of months which was not the case earlier. He experienced slight pain in the chest for the past few months (probably due to gastric problems as the cardiologist said its not related to heart and more of muscular pain). Couple of days he experienced similar pain along with a BP of 150/90. He got the chest x ray and EKH done with x-ray perfect normal with normal cardiac size and contour. The doctor said the eck was also normal. He had a heart rate of 64/pm but the report said presence of no p-wave and left axis deviation (qrs axis of -30 degree). Do we need to be worried with these results?","Doctor":"Hello welcome to HCM. I have gone through your description. To summarize your father is a hypertensive and a heart patient with two stents implanted and getting intermittent chest pain. Since the ECG and chest x ray are normal as per your cardiologist there is nothing much to worry about. A BP of 150/90 is high but is acceptable given his history of heart disease. He must continue on the blood pressure medications which over time will achieve good control over his BP. only matter that requires attention here is presence of no P waves. No P wave means the heart impulses are not coming from where they should actually arise. But since this is a machine interpretation it can be ignored, taking into consideration that your cardiologist has cleared the ECG as normal.  Heart rate of 64/min is optimal. Left axis deviation may be due to long standing hypertension and does not require any attention at this point. Please continue on his regular medications. wishing you good health.

Last night and still this morning I have a very mild pain or tightness in my left chest.  It is mostly noteable if I take a deep breath and reminds me of the kind of muscle pain I might get in other muscles a day after a work out.  Would 24hrs of Afib cause this kind of a delayed ache?  I also walked and rode my bike yesterday following the \\"all clear\\" on the ekg.  I would not normally even pay attention to this amount discomfort but following the Afib, I guess I wonder if I should back off the excercise regime.","Doctor":"HelloWelcome to HCM. Your Afib episode is controlled with the metoprolol which slows down the heart rate and inhibits extra beats from the atrium from being conducted to the ventricles. The muscle pain which you are having is not related to AFib in any way. But it can be related to associated underlying heart disease. Also the cause of the Afib must be established. I suggest you undergo a 2d echo test which will show whether the atria from which the Afib arises are dilated. It can also show presence of clots in the atrium which can form post Afib. Additional information like pumping function of the heart, functioning of the valves can also be derived by a 2 D echo. Exercise increases the heart rate and hence it may precipitate a recent Afib. You can do non strenuous exercises like brisk walking and cycling at slow speeds. But strenuous exercises should be avoided at this point of time. After a month you can gradually step up the duration of your exercise and also increase the workout. The body gets accustomed to any slow process but if it is subject to sudden conditions of fast heart rate, the Afib may precipitate.So please continue with non strenous exercises and increase gradually. Wishing you good health.

Poking pain in the chest is not typical for heart disease. Poking pain can be more related to the stress you are going through. Chest pain from cardiac origin is usually dull constant pain or heaviness/discomfort in the chest. I recommend you to lower your stress by meditation. It may sound as a normal advice but meditation can do wonders. You can start with 10-15 mins per day and increase it up to half an hour a day.

If normal then get an echo done to rule out ASD or patent foramen ovale witch may cause crossing of leg thrombus from rt heart to left heart.

I started having CP yesterday, feeling like someone is sitting on my chest. Today I woke up still with discomfort in chest, having a bad headache, got clammy earlier,and it feels like it's hard to swollow. I also have high cholesterol and started crestor 10mg about a month ago. I  feel really tired and really tired. Worried I may be having signs of a heart attack. What should I do?","Doctor":"Hello Welcome to HCM.You symptoms like chest heaviness and clamminess in presence of strong family history of premature heart disease, point a suspicion to a cardiac event. Also you have risk factor of high cholesterol. Headache and swallowing difficulty may not be directly connected to symptoms of cardiac event but can be present as associated symptoms. I recommend you get checked up for the same. You should take a ECG, 2 D Echo and a cardiac enzymes test to see if there is any damage to the heart. IF ECG and 2D Echo show no changes and cardiac enzymes are normal, then you must do a stress test after 4 days when you do not have these symptoms. A stress test can help predict if you got blockages in your heart. Please do the above and revert back with the test findings. If all the above tests are normal, you still stand at a higher risk of heart disease than other people and you must undergo yearly 2D Echo and stress tests to detect heart disease early. Wishing you good healthRegards"},{"Patient":"I have had a Percocet addiction for 35 years and have had many Dr.s in that time span. I was up to without exaggeration, eating 240 10mg p s, 98 30mg oxycodone pills, as well as an assortment of 5mg pills which were always at my disposal. I have cancer and have severe back injuries but along with the p s I also had monthly access to 240 2mg xannax pills which after awhile Ihad no problem eating all of the above each month and would look for some more. I died 4 times in a 6 year span due to double pneumonia which the Dr.s told me my medications were playing a large roll in this. When I was 16 I became an atheist due to my brother dying, he was my favorite and I became very drug dependent to kill the pain.

Prior to the test I do cough occassionally, but nothing like yesterday. Could it be related to the test? Thanks for an answer.","Doctor":"Hi,Stress echo is a test in which we give stress to the heart to see its effect and how the heart responds to stress. It will not cause such coughing as you are telling. So don't worry the persistent cough is not a side effect of the test. It can be because of respiratory infection.Hope I have answered your query.

BY your description  seems you have infective exacerbation of bronchitis. You need to take a short course of oral steroids like prednosolone in tapering doses starting from 30 mg once daily and decreasing by 10 mg every three days. Since you have already been on antibiotics there is no need for antibiotics now. But most important thing here is your inhaler which is not sufficient. Ventorlin is an inhaler which will provide only symptomatic relief. It will not help stopping the inflammation within. It is like talking paracetamol for fever. I suggest you take a steroid inhaler on a regular basis like a foracort inhaler 2 puffs twice a day amf ventorlin as required. This will curb the infection within and aid in faster recovery. You cannot be on oral steroids every time you wheeze. Please do the above mentioned and you will do exceptionally well. Wishing you good health.

Today, while running (not jogging) I began to feel out of breath and I could not run for more than 2 minutes without returning back to a walking pace.

Should I go to my family physician?","Doctor":"Hello. welcome to HCM. Your symptoms of breathlessness, chest tightness and wheeze sound like asthma. Asthma is characterised by variable airflow obstruction which means some days you will be fine and some days you will have symptoms. I recommend you undergo a pulmonary function test which requires you to breathe into a machine and your lung capacities are estimated. This will show whether you have asthma or some similar respiratory illness. Treatment can be started on basis of results of the PFT. please do a PFT and revert back with the results.

Lung consolidation means  infection of thelungd and sepsis means invasion of blood with bacteria. Since the bacteria comes into the blood, it spreads to other organs and can cause urine tract infections., brain and other main organs. This causes the drop in blood pressure. The treatment is iv fluids to raise the pressure, and to start on BP increasing medications which are given intravenously. Also intravenous broad spectrum antibiotics should be added. Blood culture, urine culture and sputum culture should be done. The culture will help identify the oragnosm causing the infection and also show the antiobiotics that are effective against it. Diuretics should be given to increase the urine output and must be closely monitored.  If organism cannot be identified by culture and the patient is not able to bring out cough, then a Bronchoscopy must be done which involves inserting a small tube with camera at its tip through the nose into the airways and take samples from the area affected. This sample can be sent for culture. Antibiotics can be modified according to the culture reports.The infection may also affect the functions of the kidney and cause kidney issues.

Thanks for posting at HCM. I would be able to help you better had you also mentioned why warfarin and ecosprin have been started in the first place. My guesses are either a heart valve replacement, atrial fibrillation (irregular heart rate) or pulmonary embolism. Since you are regular on your symbicort and have no wheeze I guess asthma side is controlled. Your symptoms seem to be due to heart issues in view of changes in ECG and previous probable history of heart disease. I recommend you to do a 2d echo to see the pumping function of the heart, any fluid overload , any leak between the valves the functioning of the heart.It will help us definitely in a evaluating the cause of the your symptoms.

Three years ago she had a chest x-ray that said she had mild bilateral bronchitis.  She had another chest x-ray just six months ago and again in says she has bilateral bronchitis.  The doctor said the cough could be from her blood pressure medicine, so they prescribed something different.  Shouldn't they be treating her for bronchitis?","Doctor":"Hello thanks for posting at HCM. Since you have mentioned that your mother is suffering from cough from four years and x ray reports bronchitis, she definitely has obstructive airway disease (OAD). Blood pressure medications like beta blockers can worsen OAD symptoms, but stopping them doesn't mean bronchitis will get treated. She definitely needs to be treated for her bronchitis or OAD with inhalers and tablets. For that we have to establish baseline lung function by doing a pulmonary function test. This will show if she has obstructive airways and the severity of obstruction. On basis of above information by PFT she can be started on medications.Please do a PFT and revert with the results. Wishing you good healthRegards."},{"Patient":"I just got over the flu about a week ago, I got better a couple days later but then bronchitis kicked in.  It gave me a chronic cough which I still have and I am still coughing up stuff.  I can deal with the bronchitis but my major problem now is that my upper right chest is in pain.  It hurts when I take deep breaths, especially hurst when I cough, and also hurts from some basic movements.  Today a slight stinging occurred.  Could this be something serious or something simple that will take care of it self on its own?","Doctor":"Hello thanks for posting at HCM. Going by your description, seems like you have got lower respiratory tract infection preceded by upper resp tract infection. The lower respiratory tract infection seems to have involved the pleura, the covering of the lungs, hence you get the pain. Please do a chest x ray to find out about the involvement of pleura and fluid accumulation within the pleura. This usually will settle with antibiotics. Since you mentioned that you had bronchitis, I suppose you were already on antibiotics. But some times people get infected with drug resistant strains I suggest you to cough up the sputum in a sterile container and give it for testing (aerobic culture) . It will show what microorganism has infected you and drugs that can act against it. According to the test results antibitiocs can be changed or continued. A lower respiratory tract takes about 14-20 days to go back to normal. So the cough will continue for some time. You can take anti tussive medications for the same. Wishing you good healthRegards"},{"Patient":"2 weeks ago I was reaching across the table and my back spazzed out (right side), from the buttocks up.

I could have helped you better had you mentioned your age, and other associated health issues if any. Going by your symptoms, here is a possibility of cardiac involvement vs muscular spasms. To rule or cardiac element, I suggest an ECG and a 2 d echo test. If both the above tests are normal then a treadmill test or a stress test should be done. This will give us sufficient information about the heart, its functioning and possibility of a cardiac element in near future. If above tests at normal, then you should take antiinflmatory non steroidal medications (NSAIDS) like diclofenac for five days duration.

You monitor your blood pressure and if it remains persistently in the lower range say less than 110 then you asked your doctor to decrease the dose of medicine.

When I lay on the bed to sleep I can hear the cough in my chest. Can you please help.","Doctor":"Hello Thanks for posting at HCM. since you have got persistent cough for one month despite being on antibiotics we must rule out if there is any baseline problem with the lungs like underlying asthma or bronchitis or pneumonia. So I recommend you to do a chest x ray and a PFT. PFT is a breathing test which requires you to blow into a machine and lung capacities are determined. It is a very informative test and will help in the diagnosis of persistent cough and breathing issues. Chest x ray will show us if there is any pneumonia affecting the lungs. Second since you have no relief despite medications, I recommend you to give a sputum sample (which you cough out) for testing. (aerobic culture, TB gene Xpert and sputum for AFB. This will show us what organisms are infecting your lungs and the drugs that can kill the microorganisms. If all above tests come out normal and you still have cough, a HRCT chest is recommended which shows us fine cuts of lung tissue to rule out other causes, or hiding infection and also can slgive information about heart, lymph nodes and other structures in the chest.Please do the above and revert back. wishing you good healthRegards"},{"Patient":"My son is 12 years old.

I told my mom to get an oxygen meter and to check his levels, especially when she see s him getting sleepy or falling asleep. When should they be concerned or I should ask, what levels are dangerous that they should reach out to his doctor?","Doctor":"Hello.thanks for posting at HCM. According to the history you have provided, i suppose your fsther is suffering from sleep apnea, that's why the cPAP machine. It helps to keep the airway open in people whose airways tend to close while they sleep. As you day he has got the machine checked for its functionality, but you also need to get it checked to ascertain whether its really helping the patient. Sometimes the pressure of air coming from the cPAP is not sufficient enough to keep the airways open. So i guess the pressure of the cPAP machine needs to be increased. All cPAP machines have a data card slot which a memory card can be put and all information can be downloaded. It will give you data about the number of hours he is using the machine, the average pressures and the apnea hypopnea index. This will give you sufficient information for his problems. Additionally since airways close during sleeping, oxygen concentration also falls. An oxygen saturation of greater than 85 % is acceptable. If it remains below 85 you have to see your doctor. Also the machine data can only be read with a special software which will be available with your doctor. Wishing you good health.

Since your pull got stuck in your throat, there are two ways it can go. In the stomach with your food pipe or in the lungs through the wind pipe. If you had got food into your windpipe, it would have cursed you significant cough. But sincere you mentioned that you had no cough or breathing difficulty, it seems the pill has reached its right place i.e. in the stomach. Also in worst case scenario if it had gone into your windpipe into your lungs, it must be dissolved by the secretions and eventually be thrown out or absorbed into the blood stream. So you nay stop worrying about it.

You seem to have got sinusitis with some lower respiratory tract infection. You need to be on medications like nasal decongestants, nasal spray and montelukast tablets.

Could I have some other type of infection? or could costo cause swollen lymph nodes? Also, this pain is pretty much a constant, however sometimes it s better/worse. if i stretch, pull, reach, turn wrong it goes right back to hurting again. i have a 1 yr old so it s hard to do NOTHING and rest it. I do tend to push on the lymph nodes often (anxiety about them and checking to see if they re gone/changed ect) which probably doesn t help them either. nodes are soft quishy movable and very little discomfert. main pain problem is the middle/right side of my chest along the sternum and towards my right shoulder a bit below my collar bone/above my breast. pains been going on for 5 weeks, swollen spots about 2.","Doctor":"Hello thabks for posting at HCM. Your pain and swelling of lymph nodes definitely need to get evaluated. Lymph node swellings are not found in costochodritis. You also have symptoms since atleast two months.L ymph node swelling happens in infective diseases, in diseases of blood and cancer. Since you are 26, its unlikely that you have cancer. Most of your symptoms go towards infection, more specifically tuberculosis. I recommend you to undergo  a HRCT scan of chest. More important is to get the lymph node at your armpits biopsied. Biopsy will see the cells and organisms at the lymph node and help you establish a diagnosis. Treatment can be planned according to the diagnosis.Wishing you good healthRegards"},{"Patient":"hy this is rajendra from bhubaneswar, orissa i want to know that before 2months ago my father have done engiogram for heart but now he feel uncomfertable when taking breath also fell very weak is there any majore problem if yes what we have to do for it?","Doctor":"HelloThanks for posting here.I would be able to help you better if you share the findings of the angiography. What did the angiogrpahy show and what was adviced. whether there were any blockages in the heart. If the heart side is cleared, then he may be suffering from some lung problems leading to breathlessness. I recommend him to do a pulmonary function test which requires the patient to forcefully blow into a machine and the lung capacities are determined. It will give a fair idea about presence of some lung disease. But this should be done only if he is clear from the heart side. If he has some significant heart blockages it must be first tackled with an angioplasty or bypass.Wishing him good healthRegards"},{"Patient":"Hi,   I am taking Lisinoperil 10mg twice a day.

She has had bad appetite for at least five years now, we can barely get her to eat anything.When she finaly manages rising her weight to normal, it takes her about a month or so to fall 7 kilo down, before getting back onto a proper weight track - which takes alot longer then a mere month for her.She was checked for asthma, and doesn't have it.She's anemic for as long as I can remmeber, and her curent doctor doesn't give us any other information other then the words ''I don't know whats wrong with her''.This causes me alot of consirn, as I am home with her daily.She doesn't have bulimia or anorexia because I would see if she was throwing up, or pushing food away.So far, she's forcing herself to eat, to gain weight, but still claims her chest pain is her biggest problem.The doctor also said he couldn't hear a heart murmur, so it's not likely a heart problem - or thats as much as I understood.","Doctor":"Hello there,Two reasons come in my mind for her1- Cardiac problem though murmur not heard2- Anemia as for her in this age is common."},{"Patient":"My wife , 61 years old, is being treated for TB .

I am fine when I lie still in bed but when I get up I just don't feel right, feel slightly dizzy and sick! Is this a common sympton to pleurisy?","Doctor":"HelloThanks for posting here. The symptoms you have mentioned can be caused by pleurisy. Pleurisy is a infection of the outer covering of the lungs called the pleura. It can cause pain along the ribs increasing on deep breathing, fever, breathing difficulty and cough. It takes about two weeks to be cured hence you may feel weak and dizzy. Another reson here may be due to antibiotics. Some people do not tolerate antibiotics and have dizziness after antibiotic use. So keep taking the medications you have been prescribed and if you dont feel fine after three more days (total 5 days on antibiotics, you must viait your doctor and get your antibiotics changed.

As you said, the PET CT shoes that it has no FDG uptake and hence called a bening one,  however it still needs investigation. The cause for the nodule should be evaluated as it may be as a result of infection including  TB (Tuberculosis) or due to an autoimmune process in which the body attacks its own cells. So a biopsy of the nodule should be done wither under CT guidance or by bronchoscopy whichever makes the nodule well accessible. Biopsy should be able to identify if its an infective process or autoimmune process and also br able to identify the cells and rule out malignancy. After biopsy if you get no answers, then you should not worry and follow up the nodule for increase in size by chest x ray or CT every 3 months to see the doubling time of the nodule.

Noe since you are on AKT 4 for more than 6 months, your ESR is coming down. an ESR of 23 is considered as normal. Please do not worry about that value. A value above 50 would be concerning.

I am having persistent pain over the upper chest , upper back near d3-d4 region and left shoulder and arm which when pressing by the fingers hurts  . ( surfing thro internet and talking to my doc, they say it is more or less aligned with symptoms of non cardiac pain – chostochondritis /fibromyalgia etc . I have had a treadmill done 4 and half years back which was negative. Recently had ecg done which was normal except that I have RBBB. I also had a 2-d echo resting which was normal . My holter showed a couple of pauses greater than 2.5 sec but with no associated symptoms which the doctor said would be termed asymptomatic but to report if any occasions of lightheadedness/ dizziness/blackout felt. My father and mother is on Bp medicine. No blood sugar. Dad is on pacemaker as used to have blackouts at particular positions of neck. Mother has arrhythmia and arthritis.I have a history of cervical spondolysis at c3-c4 as also  lower back pain( due to mild bulge at l4-l5 with mild indentation on right foramina as revealed by MRI) . I walk briskly for 30 -40 mins covering about 3-4.5 kms and also swim for about 700 mtrs in 30 min. I do not experience any squessing sudden pain or feeling of neausea etc. I am at an executive level and practically sitting in front of computer and thro meetings. I try to keep my calorie intake at about 1500-1700 calories. My details: I am a married male of 44 yrs, Ht-5’ 6” ; wt at 88 kgs ( which is much higher than max 71 allowed and which I am trying to reduce), am a non alcoholic, non smoker, have not had any tobacco products, have not had tea or coffee till date. My present BP taken day before yesterday was 122/82. My total cholesterol is at 196, LDL, 111, HDL-46. I did not have blood sugar till date but recently after two summer months of having icecreams, cold drink and chocolates it is at a level of fasting 128-130 and PP 155.","Doctor":"Hellothanks for posting such a detailed history. Your symptoms seem to be of non cardiac nature, because you are not having the symptoms on exercise and have no significant risk factors except weight. Your cholesterol levels are within the normal ranges. So this does not look like originating from heart. Since you have cervical spine issues, it can explain your upper chest and back pain issues. Also since your shoulder pain increases on pressure, it is atypical for heart disease, because pain arising from cardiac causes does not increase on pressing or touching. So you need not worry about your symptoms.Also  you said have a negative stress test 4 years ago. In my practice I advice all people above 40 to undergo a stress test annually to detect coronary artery disease early. So i would also advice you the same. Take care.

I suppose you suffer from hyperacidity symptoms also. Please take a course of pantoprazole 40mg twice a day 20 mins before meals. See if that helps. Also as you mention you have been coughing, what is the reason for your cough. Hyperacidity can also cause chronic cough.

I recently had a stent at the hospital for occipital neuralgia and received 1,000 mg of IV steroids and I am worried that my immune system is compromised.  I also have a spinal cord injury and CRPS II, so my body is taxed by pain and pharmacotherapies.  Should I be worried?","Doctor":"Hello thanks for posting here. Stenting itself wont cause immune deficit, but high dose steroids can decrease immunity and you may contract infections. PPD test is positive so there is a suspicion of TB and not a confirmatory diagnosis. It can come false positive also in many cases. So you have to get evaluated. If you have no symptoms like cough, fever, weight loss the probability of TB is less likely. Since you have got symptoms of actice respiratory infection, you must get yourselves checked up. Anyway please do a chest x ray and give your sputum (if you are producing any) for testing. Wishing you good healthRegards."},{"Patient":"I am 33, female.

The biliary causes usually manifest fairly early following surgery and demand an imaging to guide the location and lesion in bile path. MRCP is preferred to know these problems. If this proves non indicative in your case, a look out for other unrelated but mimicking pathology will be unmasked by Enhanced CT abdomen.

It looks like the cough started after a viral infection. In the beginning cough occurred in evenings and she felt breathless, now there's that throat tickling and clearing, which triggers the cough. Then she went to a pulmonologist, they did a spirometry, it did not show asthma ( she's allergic to animals, dust, bed mites, some foods). After the spirometry cough got better. Later she was diagnosed with hypertension, taken medicine from it and again started coughing, her medicine was changed to Tenaxum, it didn't stop the cough. When she went to cardiologist, he said that there is everything fine with her heart, yet her cholesterol is 7. In summer she did an X-ray, doctors said that there were small remains of bronchitis. Also she has GERD, we though that it could be from it, because it looks like the cough worsen after meals, when sitting or laying down, but no reflux medicine helped. Though when she went on strict diet her cough got better for few weeks. In December she did a second x-ray of her lungs, it showed nothing, they were completely fine and again went to pulmonologist for asthma test, FVC was 84% and no asthma again. Pulmonologist said that it could be from GERD or allergies. Now for a week she can't go to sleep without inhaler Foradil, because she wakes up in the middle of the night breathless.

When it first started, I woke up one night with a sharp pain in the extreme left of my chest.  The pain worsened when I either exhaled or inhaled completely.  I went to the ER but by the time I was seen the pain had diminished to almost nothing, and X-rays and ECG showed nothing.  This happened once a year for about 5 years.  Then in my early 20s this started to occur about twice a year, but with repeated episodes each time.  The pattern of showing up at the ER and then only being seen once the pain was already gone started to become ridiculous.  Finally, I was able to have an x-ray done before the pain subsided, but I was told that the x-ray was normal (except something to do with one of the disks in my spine?).  Nothing further was done.  Frustrated, I went to my family doctor who sent me for a chest CT, echocardiogram, and abdominal x-ray.  The chest CT showed nothing, and even though there was some question about calcification in my echocardiogram, I was told everything was fine.  The abdominal x-ray suggested some ‘fullness’ in my lower abdomen, but again, I was told that everything was fine and that I would just have to live with it. Finally, I had my worst episode in August 2010 and called 911 as I was not able to breathe at all without significant pain. The pain intensified tenfold if I tried to bend forward, and after lowering my left arm (which I raised as it seemed to help relieve the pain a little). Of course I had yet another inconclusive chest x-ray, and had a chest CT done as they found an elevated level of some enzyme in my blood and were concerned about a clot. They found nothing, so sent me home. Since July 2010, the symptoms have become almost weekly, where I have a sharp pain in my left chest, now usually under my ribs on my left, front side near the bottom of my rib cage.  The pain can be triggered by sleeping on my left side, making certain movements (such as twisting, bending forward, bringing my knees to my chest), all much more likely after eating.  I noticed that I often get the symptoms just before I have a bowel movement or just before passing gas, and when my bladder is full.  I now have gastritis and burning, aching and cramping in my stomach, which I attribute to the stress that this has caused me for the past 9 months (a biopsy of my stomach came back normal).  I am wondering if this could be a sliding hiatal hernia, and what tests could be done to figure this out, even when I don’t have symptoms (as I am not usually seen in the ER before the symptoms subside- with my shortest wait so far at 4 hours).  I would appreciate any help or advice concerning this as it seems that I am having to take this into my own hands (though inexperienced as I am not a doctor).  This is seriously affecting my life as I have had to give up teaching as bending over is something we do all day with children, which I cannot do right now.  Again, any help would be greatly appreciated. Thank you.","Doctor":"You did not mention any barium meal test was done I think it help identify any hernia or Gastroesophageal reflux.

Is this more serious than just heartburn?","Doctor":"Hello,This appears to be acidity and reflux disease. However, similar symptoms can also occurs in heart disease as well. one Ecg should be done to rule out heart disease. So avoid fatty, oily and high calorie diet.

I can understand your concern. Since your extensive cardiac work up is normal, no need to worry for heart diseases for your symptoms. We have to rule out lung related diseases (bronchitis) also. So get done PFT (Pulmonary Function Test). If PFT is also normal then no need to worry for lung diseases also. Sometimes stress and anxiety can also cause similar symptoms.

I can understand your concern. Yes, possibility of stress and anxiety related panic attack is more. But better to first rule cardiac cause for this. So get done ecg and 2d echo.

Since patient is in waiting list for kidney transplant, he is probably having end stage kidney disease. He is also not responding to EPO (erythropoitin) Injection. So blood transfusion I can understand only option left for him. He may need 1-2 PCV (packed cell volume) units every 10-15 days. This will take care of anemia. His breathlessness is due to fluid retention. And in end stage kidney diseases, dialysis is the only option to prevent fluid retention and relieve breathlessness. So he may need regular hemodialysis 1-2 times per week for fluid retention. Try for early renal transplant, till that time regular blood transfusion and hemodialysis will take care of anemia and breathlessness. Hope I have solved your query.

It is the tissue that can substitute normal lung tissue that suffered an inflammatory injury, as result of a severe infection for exemple. Some diseases are difficult to diagnosis and sometimes clinical symptoms, signs and tests findings may be inconclusive or misleading. A strong relationship of trust with your physicians is extremely important to overcome the challenges of your treatment and rehabiltation. Your physicians will not hide from you anything related to your condition if openly questioned about it. The anxiety in the presence of a condition that is not completly understood or that does not improve may sometimes leads us to look for opinions of many different specialists. However, this conduct can also cause prejudice as sometimes it is difficult to stabilish and follow a sequence to diagnosis and treatment. Talk to your attending physician, expose all your doubts and questions and if you feel assured that you are been well cared, continue your treatment."},{"Patient":"for the last 4 months i have some breathing problem initially it was bhronchitis cough and for that got medicines for 5 days it makes me alright but after every 15 days same problem re-occurs.

Asthma is a chronic condition caused in most cases by allergic inflammation of brochi. Like any chronic condition it cannot be cured, but the adherence to treatment may achieve complete control of the symptoms.

My doctors refuse to treat saying that it is normal for it to \\"colonize\\".  However I am severely symptomatic.  What to do?","Doctor":"Serratia marcescens is a gram-negative enterobacteria. It is not involved in respiratory tract infections except in critically ill patients or patients that have a chronic pulmonary condition that affects the lung anathomy, like bronchiectasis. Lungs of patients with bronchiectasis are chronically colonized by several bacteria that can't be found in a lung without disease. Most of the time these bacterias will coexist with host immune system in a balance. If by any means this balance is broken, there may be an exacerbation of symptoms. It is important to know that not every symptom that you feel has to be caused by the bacteria and it really can be just colonizing your lungs. The use of antibiotics against a colonizing bacteria has the potential to induce resistance to the antibiotics, making it hard to treat a real infection when it occurs. It is important to discuss with your physicians why they consider this bacteria a colonizing agent and if all your symtoms really correlate with it or not."},{"Patient":"Dear Doctor, I am a cardiac patient since 2004 with a minor heart attack, after that on medicine - ESoz D 40, Metpure XL 25, Clopitab 25 , Tonact 10.

The doctor says he now has what is considered whiteout in his lungs.  He has said that the outline of the heart can no longer be seen.  My father aspirated and then was diagnosed with pneumonia.  Three days later he ended up in ccu on a ventilator and has not been able to be weened off/  He is currently taking 3 antibiotics.  What is your advise.","Doctor":"Lung whiteout and loss of heart outline are findings of chest x-ray compatible with many abnormal conditions affecting the lungs, like pneumonia, pleural effusion, acute respiratory distress syndrome among others. In the actual setting, your father is already receiving treatment to his pneumonia. All the other possibilities are probably been considerated and adressed by CCU staff. Weaning from mechanical ventilation is sometimes challenging because many factors can impair patients evolution, like how long he's been in MV, his nutrition status, his cardiovascular performance and resolution of the cause that led him to MV in the first place."},{"Patient":"Hi, Im 22 and have recently had chest pain on the right side of my sternum. The pain at first was quite mild and have experienced it before and it would come and go but today it got much worse. The pain was very sharp and localized to about 1 rib. The area around it was tender and upper body movement would sometimes relieve or increase the pain. The pain hasnt spread to any other areas and Ive found shallow breaths helped lower the pain. I havent had any injuries or incidents which could have caused any broken/cracked ribs.","Doctor":"The characteristics of the pain you describe are compatible with musculoskeletal pain. It is characterized by a localized pain  that can be exacerbated by cough, respiratory movements of the chest wall, movements of the superior  members and palpation of the painful point, which will present with tenderness and, eventually, with a muscle node. Musculoskeletal pain varies in intensity and duration. It can be mild or very intense with impairment of daily life activities. It can last a few hours even if untreated or last many days, weaks or months. A localized, long lasting musculoskeletal pain that does not resolve after the use of traditional analgesics and anti-inflammatory drugs is classified as myofascial pain syndrome and frequently requires multidisciplinary intervention."},{"Patient":"Hello.

I have been running 3-6 miles daily for almost two years and doing other exercises as well. The past 2 weeks I have had some issues when running/jogging. At first I thought it was because I spent all winter running indoors on a treadmill and in the past two weeks moved outside to run. But, when I run I get a tight feeling in my chest and have trouble breathing, not real bad, but bad enough that I have to walk to get it under control then I can continue to run again. This starts about 10 minutes into my workout and then when I walk it takes about 3 minutes to get back where I can continue to run and this just keeps going in a cycle. Yesterday since it was too cold to run outside I ran on the treadmill inside and it happened there too, so my previous theory of moving outside I don t think is correct. I am not overweight 5 2 118 lbs and as stated before in very good shape. I just need to get an idea of what is going on.

Prior to surgery, it was more frequent. I sleep on a wedge pillow, plus another standard pillow to prevent acid coming up, and I eat by 5:30 to give adequate time for food to digest (this has helped tremendously to the point where I don t need medication regularly, but wonder why it happens every other day and is there anything else I can do? And is it happening because acid comes up to my airway and creates swelling? PS--my pulmonologist prescribed inhalers, but it brought no relief whatsoever.","Doctor":"Hi, Thanks for your question. I can understand your pain and discomfort. your problem should be evaluated by your doctor to make sure that its not a cpmplication from the surgery you have undergone. Ask your doctor as it could be a gas bloat.A common side effect of the surgery is gas bloat. Air becomes trapped in the stomach, causing pain and discomfort and difficulty in breathing.  Chew your food well. Eat small meals. Avoid carbonation (soda) and drinking from a straw. All of these will increase the air in your stomach.I hope I was able to address your query.

Also you mentioned there is enlargement of heart. So considering your echo report to be significant ( or it may be just a hypertensive change on echo which your doctor conveyed as enlargement, so please upload your report for better clarification) you should either undergo stress thallium or TMT test which will further help to resolve the issue. I also think you should take treatment for cholesterol like Atorvastatin, as these meds have multiple heart protective effect other than cholesterol lowering.You should have a healthy lifestyle like avoiding fatty, oily and high calorie diet. Have low salt diet and monitor blood pressure regularly thrice a day for one week then once or twice a week. Regular exercises like brisk walking, jogging according your capacity at least 30 min a day and 5 days a week. Eat lots of green leafy vegetables, fruits, fish once or twice a week, avoid meat.

I have reviewed your query and here is my advice.In case of pulmonary embolism throbolysis is done using heparin therapy. After acute attack oral anticoagulant drug like warfarine is prescribed for three to five month at least. If there is no further higher risk then only oral anticoagulant drug is stopped. If the patient is having higher risk then life long therapy might be needed. Hence after taking clinical consideration, PT and APTT reports, and D dimer report further management plan will be decided. If needed, CT angiography can be done to detect if any residual thrombosis is present. Consult a cardiologist for examination with keeping all this in mind.Hope I have answered your query.

The condition usually affects the cartilage where the upper ribs attach to the breastbone (sternum), an area known as the costosternal joint.Chest pain caused by costochondritis can range from mild to severe.Primary biliary cirrhosis is considered an autoimmune disease, in which the body turns against its own cellsThe bile ducts in your liver are slowly destroyed. Bile, a fluid produced in your liver, plays a role in digesting food and helps rid your body of worn-out red blood cells, cholesterol and toxins.The costochondritis does not cause PBC but it might be associated with it.When costochondritis is associated with liver disease, it is more difficult to treat.So take care and the relevant specialists will advice you further.Thank youDr.JolandaPulmonologist"},{"Patient":"I don't even know where to begin.

What does this mean? how serious are these findings? thank you.","Doctor":"Hello and thank you for asking in HCMAn enlarged heart (cardiomegaly) is not a disease itself but a physical sign that can accompany many diseases and conditions.Treatment and prognosis are dependent upon the specific cause.Atherosclerosis is a condition in which fatty material collects along the walls of arteries. This fatty material thickens, hardens (forms calcium deposits), and may eventually block the arteries. Atheromatous aorta means atherosclerosis of the aorta. The heart is directly connected to the aorta such that it pumps blood immediately into it. If you block the aorta, the heart would then work extra harder to pump blood into the aorta since it's so \\"tight\\" there.So the medication according to these findings is mandatory and the cardiologist will advice you further.Thank you and good luckDr.Jolanda Pulmonologist"},{"Patient":"I have been sick all winter with bronchistis .
