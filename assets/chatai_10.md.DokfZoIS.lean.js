Type 1 tends to live near the mouth and type 2 tends to live near the genitals but they can live in either place.  The symptoms usually are burning or pain followed by a sore which can look like a little collection of bubbles or bumps with some redness around it.  The sores will heal on their own but you can take medicine to help this along.  The sores can come back and tend to do this when you are run down, tired, stressed or the immune system is not working right.  Some people take medicine every day to prevent outbreaks of the sores.  You can have a positive blood test for herpes but no sores.  This means you have been exposed to the virus and may be carrying it.  Everyone is different.  Some people get lots of sores and others may never get an outbreak again after the first one.  The best thing you can do is take care of yourself.

The first 2 times I had postive stool tests, the 3rd time given erythrymyacin which I was unable to tolerate after 2 days. Now it seems it is back again.I also have CFSany advice, is this normal to keep relapsing?regards Maxine","Doctor":"Hello Maxine,I read your message carefully and I understand your medical problem.You are going through campylobacter infection for the fourth time now.  You mention positive stool test and intolerance to erythromycin. Azithromycin is the first choice in Campylobacter infection. Erythromycin is a drug of choice because its resistance remains low. You are sensitive to Erythromycin so you can not take it. Other alternatives are ciprofloxacin, tetracycline and clindamycin in adults, but in a combination therapy. Actually, there is a schedule for the treatment of campylobacter involving antibiotics, anti-H2 antagonists (ranitidine, cimetidine, etc)  and proton-pump inhibitors (omeprazole, pantoprazole, etc). You are experiencing antibiotic resistance. Campylobacter is a bacteria which is able to develop mechanisms to protect itself from drugs.Combination therapy of antibiotics can be of help in this case based on culture and sensitivity test of the stool. Do not forget about changes in your diet habits and keep a good personal hygiene as it is a cause to foodborne illness. Discuss this further with your doctor. Wish fast recovery.

I was also advised to take Aquaurinon injection weekly once. After continuing the above treatment for 4 months my count has been still the same. Our family doctor says that i need to have atleast 40 to 60 million count to conceive. She feels there might be some hormonal problem that she has to check.

My wife has a proper menstural cycle and the egg also releases properly. Earlier our doc said 20 Million is sufficient but now she says i have to increase it to 40 to 60 million for IVF or any other thing to go on. So kindly suggest me what to be done, thank you. Regards, Farooq","Doctor":"Hi, Thanks for posting in HCM. I have read your description and understand your concern. Based on the semen analysis report, the following things can be concluded. 1. Physical characteristics like colour, appearance, quantity and reaction are normal. 2. Total sperm count is slightly towards the lower side than normal, but acceptable. 3. Sperm motility of 50% actively motile seems to be less than normal. Hence, the fertility index seems to be less than normal. However, what medications have been given is right and it would certainly aid in improving the features of sperm quality and quantity. It can be known after a repeat semen analysis after taking the medications for a month or more. In case you are planning for In-vitro fertilization (IVF) procedure, sperm count does not seem to matter much but only requires sperms to be of good quality. In case you are planning for Intrauterine insemination (IUI) procedure, both quality and quantity of sperms matters. You can plan for the procedure according to your needs on consultation with your treating doctor. Hope the information provided would be helpful. All the best."},{"Patient":"hi my friend has had this patch on her forehead for more than a week now, she went to go check it out by the doctor and she was told that she ring worm, Now I am scared that I might get it because I interact with her quite a lot we even share a locker at work together.

In case of fungal infection using anti fungal ointments/creams like terbinafine (lamisil) or miconazole for local application will be helpful. Keep the area dry. Use loose and cotton underwear.

My daughter says I fell because these sandals have too much of a grip and there for contributed to my falling. My thought if the grip is smooth it would be more likely to cause a fall. These DWAGs are very comfortable and my legs do not hurt or feet if I wear them all day.","Doctor":"Falls are the main concern in Parkinson disease. Along with the medical treatment that I suppose you are taking, is very important to choose the right shoes to wear. To my opinion, a sandal that attaches to the floor is not appropriate, because it can cause you to fall, and is hard to move. I would prefer something that is not heavy, has a hard sole not that heavily gripped that can contribute also to your gait stability.The shoes you find should be easy to wear.I know that you might feel very comfortable with DWAGS sandals, but to my opinion they are not the best choice for you.Hope I answered to your question"},{"Patient":"back in november I had come down with flu like symptoms, diahrreah, nausea, vomiting and fatigue!

I went to the doctor and they said it was because of an infection/virus and that it would go down. up until that point I had been perfectly fine with no infections/viruses. the one behind my ear did go down but the one in my neck has stayed and got slightly bigger. I went to the doctors again after having the lump for about 6 moths and was told again that it was nothing and it would go down. I then started to get migraines after going on the contraceptive pill, and feeling generally unwell/tired, so i stopped taking the pill and went back to the doctors, they did some blood tests as my doctor though it might be glandular fever, but these all came back fine. I still have to lump, it aches from time to time and I still get migraines, usually around my period, which can last for days. recently I've also been getting pain/aching in the colar bone region of my neck upwards, especially on my left side, there doesnt seem to be any more lumps though. if that makes sense? should i be worried?","Doctor":"Good morning Madam, Thank you for sharing your concerns with us. I will try to hep you as much as I can through my answer.As I understand, you have got two problems. The first one is a swelling (most probably an enlarged lymph node in the neck). If a lymph node stays enlarged for a long time without any signs of infection (warmth, redness, pain), it is safe to have it removed so that it can be seen under a microscope to make sure that there is nothing dangerous. I would recommend you to discuss this option with your doctor.The second problem is a headache. Oral contraceptive pills are known to cause a migraine. It can also occur around the time of menstruation. If a migraine is too frequent and is disruptive, then I would recommend discussing the option of prophylactic medicine for this condition with your doctor.I hope this answers your question.

All the symptoms that you are currently having are due to the steroids, which are very powerful medications that will hopefully make you feel much better in the future. Continue to take them as prescribed. Bronchitis is an inflammatory disease of the lungs which is generally caused by an infection or a chemical irritant. Cough is usually the only symptom which can last for many months. In children and teenagers that get bronchitis, they should be screened for genetic and anatomic anomalies of the respiratory tract, immune systems, and for chronic asthma and allergies. Viruses such as RSV are very common at this time of the year. I would recommend frequency hand washing, update vaccinations, avoid smoking and secondhand smoking, control asthma and allergies if you have either of them, cough drops, double you fluid intake, continue the steroids, rest, treat acid reflux if you have it, tylenol for pain and headaches, bendaryl for sinus congestion, and the medications prescribed as above.

Some but not all of my food allergies are gluten, dairy, soy, corn, oats, and tree nuts.  There are many other foods that I am allergic to, however those are my most severe.  I have had numerous blood tests throughout my life to track these allergies, used an elimination based diet, rotated my diet to prevent new allergies, and altered my nutritional lifestyle completely, which has increase my health dramatically. Recently I have been suffering from recurrent cellulitis infections, over the past 12 months I have had cellulitis 7 times.  I have an allergy to sulfa medication so I have been taking either clindamycin or doxycycline to treat these infections.  The medicine has always made me feel nauseous, feverish, and cause severe stomach pains right after taking the medicine.  I recently looked into the contents of the pills and the second ingredient is corn starch, so it turns out that I am actually allergic to the medication. I have been to my primary care physician and also an infectious disease specialist and they don’t seem to have any idea as to why I get these infections. The usual response I get is that it’s not normal to get such frequent infections, but I’m one of the people who must just be prone to them. Until last summer, I had never had one of these infections, so something must have changed whether it is environmental or even related to my food allergies.  I’m not too sure if you are someone that can help me, but I am interested to hear if you may be able to offer more insight than I have currently received from other doctors and specialists.","Doctor":"Thanks for your question. Are you sure that the rashes you are getting are in fact cellulitis and not an eczema-type rash that can frequently accompany food allergies? Cellulitis is a recurrent infection. If you keep getting skin infections, you have to look at immunity (have immunoglobulin levels checked) and also evaluate where these rashes are occurring. If they are on your legs and you shave, for example, you may have to make sure to change your razor. If its on your feet, it could be fungal. The other main question to evaluate, therefore, is where you are getting these rashes. Doxycycline is known to cause stomach upset and should be taken with a full glass of water and full stomach. However, if you are allergic to corn starch and that is in the medicine, you may need to find new medication or a different preparation, if you are sure your rash is cellulitis."},{"Patient":"hi doc chetna jaini hira from pakistanim married for last 3 years and have a baby girl of 1 year agebefore birth of my daughter, i had a misscarriage of 2 monthsbut then i was blessed with a daughterabout 10 months ago, i developed vaginal infection along with skin infection/ irritation... me n my husband could not ve sex as i use to feel alot of pain after it... the skin use to get red and even a drop of water would cause alot of pain... i consulted doctors here.. they gave me antibiotics namely.... sporanax, flagyl, augmentin, calamox...the doc said that my husband might have infection as well.... so they advised antibiotics for him as well...we completed the course and the problem got reduced,,, few days ago, we went to bed and after that i developed same problem....can u please guide me what to do....waiting for your kind replythanks","Doctor":"Infection is mostly caused by mixed flora of organisms such as fungus, protozoa and bacteria.

I am really confused whether to continue the tablets or once again consult my doctor.","Doctor":"Hello Dear. You are having hypothyroidism. That is a condition where your thyroid gland does not produce enough thyroid hormones. The thyroid controls how your body's cells use energy from food, a process called metabolism. If you don't have enough thyroid hormone, your body processes slow down. That means your body makes less energy, and your metabolism becomes sluggish. Hence the calories are not burnt properly and in turn will lead to accumulation of fat. You need to maintain your thyroid hormone levels at normal range for atleast an year and follow the below tips to see the results.Take medications as prescribed by the doctor. Go for regular follow up and check your thyroid levels at the prescribed intervals. Some of the tips1. Do regular exercise. Join a gym. Take the help of a trainer. Since your metabolism is slow, you need to work out under an expert trainer2. Go for a morning walk. Brisk walk for half an hour needed3. Diet control. Dieting is not about starving. It is about taking right food in right intervals. Avoid high calorie food, oily food. Consume fruits, green leafy vegetables and food rich in fibre content. Small meals at frequent intervals is required rather than uneven eating.4. Do not take stress. Learn meditation techniquesHope i have answered your question.

My Father is 56 Yrs old. He was a chain smoker and an alcoholic till the day it was discovered that his vocal chord was completely choked and was hardly able to speak. We immediately got him admitted in hospital at Dehradun in the month Nov- 2010. Later on after the diagnosis it was found that he has got tuberculosis in Categor-1, wherein they suggested starting with the DOT medicines. After 5 days in the hospital he got discharged and he was brought home. His weight was by then 50Kg. He was on healthy diet since then and completely stopped smoking and drinking. After a week when we started with the DOT after 2 days he started coughing blood heavily. He was then again rushed to hospital in Dehradun and was admitted there for atleast a week.  After he got discharged, after a week again he started coughing blood in medical term he had Hemoptysis. Though this time as it was suggested by the doctor in the hospital to be given at the time of emergency, injection “TRANEXA” was given to him.My queries are:1.     Do we need to admit my father again, if yes then for how long?2.     As told by the doctors that coughing blood is recurring, can we give the injection regularly?     a.     When all do we need to give him Injection?b.     Do we need to start with giving the other vitamins and Glucose doses?3.     In such a case how long does it take a patient to recover?4.     What all precaution we need to take with such a patientI will be really great full if you can answer my all these query asap.ThanksPoonam","Doctor":"GreetingsWelcome to Healthcaremagic Poonam.Hemoptysis in TB infection of the lungs is a common phenomenon and is usually not that severe to get the patient admitted .It mostly occurs when due to TB lesion a blood vessel near the airways inside the lungs are injured. But having said that it is also very important to note that hemoptysis can also occur in other conditions too which may be associated with smoking . So chest X-rays have to be done in order to see if any mass has developed which may be the cause of hemoptysis.Let me answer your queries one by one.1) Admission in hospital will depend on how much blood is coming in the sputum. If it is fresh and at least a teaspoon ful of blood is coming regularly through out the day then patient needs admission and IV medications are given to control the Bleed. If occasionally it is he has hemoptysis then there is nothing much to worry about . Just keep an eye on shortness of breath and do regular CBC to see if he is not going into anemia.2)Recurrent hemoptysis is , as told earlier , worrisome only when it is occurring too often and patient is developing shortness of breath. Therefore injections are advised accordingly.3)Injection are advised when massive bleeding starts in sputum and on regular basis . Then injection is advised urgently4) If he is having good diet then there is usually no need of glucose or other vitamins .But it is must to give VITAMIN B6 in patient have Anti Tuberculosis medication to prevent side effects of medications.5) Well recovery from TB differs case to case but usually in 2 months time patient notices slight improvement but the duration of treatment is 9 months and one important thing to remember that after initial 2 months it is mandatory to change the medication after 2 months . So you should visit your doctor after 2 months of TB treatment who will change the medication . The initial medication should NOT be taken for more then 2 months . 6)First and foremost precaution is that you and family member should protect themselves by making the patient wear a high quality mask all the time.Especially Initial 2 weeks are the most infective so great precaution needs to be taken . Secondly as mentioned earlier Vit B6 is a must with TB medications.Thirdly timing of TB treatment is absolutely necessary and a dose should never be missed in any condition. I hope the answer was helpful . In case you need any further assistance feel free to contact in writing  .Regards.

Make sure your daughter is not allergic to any of these ingredients by testing a small patch of skin on her arms (not face).

Enlarged liver can be caused by many reasons that can't be counted here, but mainly due to  Hepatitis Infection (A,B,C or E),  it can also be due to Alcoholic or non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, history of medication drugs abuse, there are other causes such as Hepatocellular carcinoma etcOverall the doctors have to run more tests such as blood test that is known as Liver function test to show us how the liver is functioning or if there is any kind of infection, they might also consider doing abdominal ultrasound or CT scan  to look at the liver more clearly also please mention to the doctor if your partner had recently had any episodes of black stools (medically known as Malena) as that could be a sign that he has upper GI bleeding. people with liver disease develop some sort of thing known as portal hypertension which could lead to bleeding in the Gastrointestinal system mainly esophagus or stomach.

His ultrasound report,blood sugar, uroflam test everithing is normal. During this period he gets high fever & severe head ache, so bad that he cannot move his head in any direction.I'm very worried about his head ache and other symptoms. He has taken many antibiotics .It didn't work it is recurrent now. Now, his Dr. has prescribed an antibiotic called urifast, daily two times for 14 days & then he has to take this tablet for 2 months, once daily and, his Dr. told him to take IVU X-RAY also.Dr is there any problem for taking this antibiotic such a long period.HIS IMMUNITY IS VERY POOR.Any weather change he falls sick.Pls help my son. Dr. his body wt is about 94 kg.","Doctor":"Hi dear, Thanks for choosing HCM. I have read your question well and understand your concern and i will do my best to assist you.There are few questions i would like to ask to better understand your case such as has your son lost weight recently? you said his weight was 94KG? has he lost or gained weight in the last 6 months? Does he have any history of Diabetes, Rhematoid Arthritis, does he take any medications that reduce his immunity? Now if i answer based on the information you provided. First of all, one thing you should know is that male Urinary tract infection are mostly difficult trace or manage compared to females, it's more likely to see a recurrent female infection than male.I don't know what made your doctor to treat your son with only antibioitc medications, if i was your Doctor i would consider admitting him to hospital so that i can take all necessary tests required, i would aslo consider treating him by giving him IV solution to help him rehydrate and IV antibiotics to better eradicate the pathogen, specially that he was sick for that long. the IVU test the doctor ordered is a good choice to look for any abnormalities in the whole urinary tract including kidneys. Here is few things i would do if you came to my Hospital, you can consider discussing the following with your Doctor.1.Admit to hospital immidiately, so that i can give IV fluids and IV antibiotics and run tests such as CBC, Urine analysis, Urine culture, IVU. 2. Since your son had reccurent UTI, i might consider doing some other tests to see if he has other commorbidities such as diabetes , Tuberclosis etc.3.Some patient that had reccurrent UTI might actually have something called Fistulas caused by a disease known as Crohns disease. Therefore if IVU shows normal results, i will refer him to Gastroentrology specialist to do Colonscopy.specially if your son suffers from diarrhea Crohns disease is an Inflamatory Bowel disease that causes severe abdominal pain and could lead to forming fistuala (holes between intestines and urinary tract) that might cause some bacterias from the Intestines to reach to the urinary tracts thus cause an Urinary tract infection. I hope you can discuss the points i mentioned with your current Doctor so they can consider it.  Wish you all the best and i hope your son gets better soon ."},{"Patient":"A friend is experiencing arrhythmia and is scheduled for an EP study to determine whether she needs another ablation.

However cough has not reduced. I sweat a lot especially at night.  I feel very tired and drowsy for the past 2 days. Is this normal for viral fever or could this be a symptom of any other viral fever like Dengue, H1N1 or TB?","Doctor":"HiThank you for asking HCMi have gone through your query. Cough is not an usual symptom for dengue. But body pain and tiredness are characteristic findings. Doing a blood routine and platelet count will be helpful. Platelet count will be usually low in case of dengue. If it is low then you can go for dengue and lepto immunoglobulin test to rule out Dengue or leptospirosis. H1N1 will have predominent respiratory symptoms. If you have such symptoms then you can go for throat swab to rule out H1N1. Only if cough lasting more than 2 weeks TB test will be required. Take plenty of fluids . Take chewable vitamin C also. A consultation with physician is also well appreciated.Hope this may help you.

After completion of cousre there is still little swelling in glands, which much little as it was 9 months ago. I just want to know why there is swelling after completion of course","Doctor":"HiThanks for posting on HCMGiven that one of the manifestations of glandular TB is the progressive enlargement of the glands, the original size of glands before infection may not be attained so easily given the chronic inflammation that already took place.The size is however expected to reduce in the course of the treatment.Persistent minor swelling does not mean you still have the infection.However, after the treatment, a gland biopsy can still be sent for analysis before you are declared fhealed.You may see your Doctor for a confirmation of healing if not yet done.Hope this will helpBest regards"},{"Patient":"shingels night sweats I have had night sweats periodically for the past year. Last summer I started getting pink spots on my back arms and chest. They stay pink for a day or two and then turn white. They started appearing again this past week. 1 month ago I got shingels went to the doctor and got it taken care of and today I noticed my symptoms And shingels came back. It also seems like my short term memory has been getting worse. My left shoulder and neck also periodically hurt, and I have had a loss of appetite. I know this is a lot of stuff and it s freaking me out. Please respond","Doctor":"Shingles is characterized by a painful skin rash with blisters. It is caused by varicella zoster virus. Chickenpox is due to an initial infection with VZV. Once chickenpox has resolved, the virus may remain inactive in nerve cells. Shingles occurs when viral antibody titer and cellular immunity decline to levels that allow viral reactivation. Predisposing factors are old age, immune-compromised patients such as HIV infection, patients on chronic steroid and chemotherapy. Shingles resolves within 3–5 weeks, but secondary bacterial infection and chronic pain due to post – herpetic neuralgia may occur. Vaccination reduces the frequency of post – herpetic neuralgia. Advice 1.     Take Zostavax vaccine if you are more than 50 years under medical supervision2.     For fresh attack, you can take valaciclovir 500 mg three times daily per oral if blisters are covering large area. No need of oral valaciclovir if blisters are localized to smaller area3.     Apply locally aciclovir 3% ointment five time daily 4.     Do not take mental stress as it aggravates shinglesFor post – herpetic neuralgia1.     Gabapentin 100 mg three times daily for 10 days2.     Methylcobalamin 500 mcg once daily per oral for 3 monthsThanks"},{"Patient":"Hi, Doctor For the past sixteen days I've had swollen lymph nodes in my neck, front and back, and I spotted one today underneath my arpit.

This is caused by human papilloma virus (HPV) and is transmitted by sexual intercourse. It is a very resistant kind of infection. Relapse is common very after treatment. Creams, surgery and laser treatments are available but no treatment guarantees cure. Sometimes it resolves spontaneously without treatment. You have already undergone laser treatment. It has again relapsed. Treatment is not required if it not causing any problem. Advice 1.     Imiquimod 5% cream – apply it only on wart which is outside anus. Apply onto fingertip and rubbed onto clean, dry, wart area until cream vanishes, once daily, three times per week at bed time. Wash off next morning with soap and water. Apply very small amount. Use this for 16 weeks continuously. But do not use it if you are pregnant or planning to conceive.

She went to the doctor originally because of acute pain in the abdomen radiating down right leg. 500mg of penicillin had immediate effect on the pain. Dr. says that GBS is not the cause of the pain??? Any ideas???","Doctor":"Guillain-Barre syndrome (GBS) is a rare disorder that causes your immune system to attack your peripheral nervous system (PNS). The PNS nerves connect your brain and spinal cord with the rest of your body. Damage to these nerves makes it hard for them to transmit signals. As a result, your muscles have trouble responding to your brain. No one knows what causes the syndrome. Sometimes it is triggered by an infection, surgery, or a vaccination. Antecedent infections are thought to trigger an immune response. Symptoms are preceded by an antecedent event. Respiratory infections are the commonest followed by gastroenteritis as the antecedent cause. The commonest manifestation is limb weakness. In your case abdominal pain might be due to gastrointestinal infection i.e. antecedent event which triggered GBS. So be in contact with your doctor. Intravenous immunoglobulin & plasma exchange (plasmapheresis) are treatment options of GBS.

Local steroid therapy can produce atrophic skin changes such as thinning of the skin, irreversible striae, hypopigmentation and telangiectasia, and even adrenal suppression and Cushing’s syndrome. Probably slight hypo-pigmentation and dermal denting is due to side effect of Kenalog injection. Denting is due to atrophic changes in skin. Denting is permanent. Normal color of skin may or may not return. But why you are so worried. These are totally harmless and nobody is going to see your leg. Everybody is not perfect. Try to accept it.

The first medication which is given in staph infection is combination of amoxicillin + clavulanic acid . This medication covers the infection very well . But many times this infection becomes resistance to this antibiotic. In that case there are other medications . But a pus sample is tested in order to know which antibiotic is effective in such cases. That way we can give the exact effective drug and hence have higher chances of recovery. As far as you wound is concerned , it is important to know if you wound seems to be infected on inspection . Or do you have fever . If so then you need treatment and wound care would also be needed . IF you dont have these problems then there is nothing to worry about. As long as your blood sugars are continuously well controlled your infection will be also well controlled. Smoking in addition to diabetes rings alarm bells  , So i recommend strongly to quit smoking now before its too late. Ointment can be given like polyfax ointment , But has limited role if infection is wide spread. I hope the answer was helpful.

And people tend to have surgeries to get rid of it but complete cure is usually not achieved. Well there are many reasons for this long term issue but one of the most common problem that i notice in my clinic is that either the patient rides a motorbike and is exposed to fast blowing air or has had history of different allergies to different environmental factors. So foremost question here would be if you have either of these problems. Secondly this problems is also common in those people who are used to keep the temperature of their air conditions of the car, office or the house very low. As they shift from cooler environment like the indoor to outside heat there is sudden change in temperature which worsens nasal congestion and hence sinusitis worsens.Therefore i would suggest that instead of taking too much of medication and surgeries, you should take care of all the above mentioned factors and avoid mucus collection in the sinus altogether. To avoid allergies , it is advisable to visit an allergy clinic and sensitization protocols should be followed to reduce episodes of sinusitis due to allergies like pollen allergies.   I hope the answer was helpfull.  In case of further assistance , feel free to contact in writing .

The doctor had prescribed Flucanazole tablets and Zole-F cream. It took 3 weeks to heal. But, the infection did not seem to cure 100%. My scrotum often goes dry and white and becomes itchy and with a burning sensation. When the scrotum skin is stretched, I observed a kind of drought area like texture with small dark patches in irregular shapes. Applying coconut oil provides temporary relief. It does not itch during night times, except in one or two instances. I am not sure if it is still a fungus infection. I do not have fungus infection on foot or else where. During the mid of the day, the scrotum skin becomes dry and the skin turns pale white and it burns a bit. This kind of infection is observed only on the scrotum, and not on the penis nor on the bottom of the scrotum. I also have developed 3 small blisters on the upper left side of the scrotum, which earlier were the size of a pea and now has reduced in size, but is still there. I apply coconut oil daily morning and before going to bed and stay calm for 30 mins until the skin absorbs it, and I am doing it since a year and yet no signs of cure. I fear of approaching a skin doctor as he might prescribe steroids which may worsen the situation. Adding to it, I recently developed 3-4 white patches on the left side of the groin area which itches quite often. I started applying a Micanazole Nitrate + Fluocinolone Acetonide based cream since last 4 weeks. Please let me know if my scrotum skin infection is an indication of fungal infection.Thanks in advance,","Doctor":"Probably you are suffering from fungal infection. Don’t be afraid of steroid because topical steroid generally does not cause any side effect. Steroid will provide symptomatic relief from itching and rednessAdvice 1.     Apply antifungal cream containing clotrimazole, steroid and antibiotic such as Lobate GM  cream thrice daily for 15 days2.     Fluconazole 150 mg per oral weekly for 2 months – total 8 tablets3.     Keep your groin area clean and dry4.     You can use ketoconazole dusting powder also5.     Do not scratch 6.     Take high protein diet such as eggs and cheese to boost immunity7.     Investigation – blood sugar (fasting & postprandial)Thanks"},{"Patient":"I just had my first abnormal pap smear and now I am going back for a colposcopy because I have high grade abnormal cells.

A few days later I was treated for a UTI but I never told them what happened because I was so embarrassed. My last pap smear was the summer of 2009, after the incident, and it came back normal. I guess my question is if bacteria from that could be causing my abnormal cells?","Doctor":"Hi, Thanks for posting in HCM. I have read your description and understand your concern. Urinary tract infection is caused due to pathogenic bacteria invading the mucosa of urinary tract. it can be effectively controlled and cured by taking appropriate antibiotics. This has nothing to do with the abnormal cells observed in PAP smear examination. PAP smear would tell the mucosal status and changes taking place in the cervix. Kindly get evaluated and treated accordingly by getting the necessary investigations, as advised. Hope the information provided would be helpful. All the best."},{"Patient":"I don't know if I have HPV anymore. I got it when I was 16. I am now 19.

My question is this \\" That i have to start course again or is it fine?\\"","Doctor":"R-Cinex (isoniazid/rifampin) is an antibiotic prescribed to treat patients who are suffering from tuberculosis. It is typically prescribed to be administered once each day for a set cycle of treatment at the indicated dosage. Your individual regimen will be determined based on the severity of your symptoms, current health condition, and response to previous treatments. Never deviate from these instructions as misuse of this medicine can lead to serious and unexpected health problems. Food interferes with the absorption of rifampicin component of  R – Cinex, that may cause failure of treatment and development of drug resistant bacteria. That’s why it is taken empty stomach to increase absorption of rifampicin.  As you have taken one or two doses along with tea or juice, it won’t affect your regimen. There is no need to restart the regimen. But be careful in future. Swallow your daily dose on an empty stomach along with a full glass of water. To ensure the correct usage, try to take the tablets one hour before eating or two hours after a meal. You are also suggested to take the doses at the same time each day to get the most efficient results by keeping a consistent level of medicine in the system at all times. Never stop taking the medicine before instructed to do so, even if your symptoms appear to be cured. Consult your physician regularly while undergoing treatment to make sure you are getting the correct effects.Thanks!!"},{"Patient":"i have hepatitis c for about ten years I am running a fever, muscle pains itchy skin nausea and am tired all tne time this happens to me every few months also ringing in my ears and headache I have never been treated for hepatitis only told that I have it what should I do each time I get sick it is a little worse this time my fingers and legs seem to be swelled","Doctor":"Hi welcome to HCM..You are having hepatitis c virus infection. ...It is since ten years so chance of cirrhosis and portal hypertension is there ...USG and serum albumin will be useful for that ....If portal hypertension there ( suspected by splenomegaly and ascites if present ) than beta blocker needed ..For edema low salt diet taken and diuretic if needed ....If needed than HCV RNA done to detect if it is in active stage...for which antiviral medication needed ...Daily take grined spinach and carrot juice ...According to your disease severity treatment individualized .Take care Advise : consult physician ..."},{"Patient":"..My brother suffering fever with 1 month and after that revealed that he has faced with gland T.B. in left chest in a month ago and operation had been done successfully.

I had a bad stomach flu a month ago then a chest infection which lasted 4 weeks. I'm just over it. The last week, I put drops of oil of oregano under my tongue which helped but also stung. Last week in that place under my tongue,I developed to open (canker) sores. The sides of my throat have been tender. Yesterday my tongue was coated white. Today I have bumps along the side of my tongue and two of the sores under my tongue have black pin dots in the middle...painful. Any ideas would be most helpful. I'm concerned it's cancer. I haven't smoked for 12 years. I get canker sores a few days after I drink coffee (rare)or eat chocalate (occasional) I am female 62,5'7\\" 138lbs. I take 1-2 percosets a day for5 herniated discc a a spur, wellbutrin for depression. I lost both parents last year, an in December I was a caregiver for a dear friend who ha pancreatic cancer. I feelpretty low in spirits and energy.   Hi, may I answer your health queries right now ?  Please type your query here...","Doctor":"HI, thanks for using healthcare magicIt is understandable to be concerned but it may not be cancer at all..The canker sores may be simply due to irritation of the tongue from the caffeine. Can also occur if the immune system is impaired for any reason eg infection, diabetes, side effect of medication eg steroids or any immune suppressants.You may want to consider blood tests such as complete blood count and ESR. These would look for infection and would also determine if more dangerous conditions such as cancer , are present.ESR is a non specific inflammatory marker meaning it goes up when there is any inflammation in the bodyI hope this helps"},{"Patient":"my daughter has had sinus drainage since December.

I don't know what could it be? when I go to doctor they tell me its an allergy.","Doctor":"hi! geographical tongue is usually related to glossitis, however, there some instances that yeast overgrowth in the stomach can cause tonsillis, pain in the submandibular lymphnodes/ pain and lymph adenopathy and later on will result to glossitis. as we know that yeast can grow in an acidic environment and sugar-laden environment. however, there are several causes that the tongue may swell and that could be caused by allergens, nutritional deficiencies and/ or infections. if the swelling of your tongue/ glossitis/ geographic tongue is caused by allergens then probably that is also the cause of your hives on the face. we need to treat the cause of your geographic tongue, if you think it is from yeast overgrowth in the stomach, then, a diet modification will do. like avoiding acidic foods and beverages, avoiding cheese, nuts or those foods that is high in sugar and at the same time a probiotic drink will help to normalized the intestinal flora. if you think it is caused by allergy then avoiding all the foods and allergens is the mainstay of prevention, and at the same time taking a antihistamine drug will help."},{"Patient":"I have a sever pain on my shoulder around the scapula bone.

Warts are usually self-limiting usually smaller warts resolve spontaneously, but treatment is given to reduce pain, decrease duration, and reduce transmission as it is contagious and spread by direct and indirect contact.

In patients with compromised immune system like patient with organ/bone marrow transplant, warts spread rapidly and are bigger is size.Advice 1.     Apply salicylic acid 6% locally twice daily but do not apply this in facial or eyelid wart.

Your proneness to infection depends upon your body defense system (immune system) which fight against any such invading agent such as bacteria, virus and fungus. There are a number of factors which jeopardize your immune system resulting in increased susceptibility to infection. Those factors include nutritional deficiency, diabetes, HIV infection, compromised skin integrity such as after surgery or trauma, excessive sweating, compromised blood circulation, congenital immunoglobulin deficiency and chronic diseases etc. Look at these aspects. You might find the cause of repeated infection in yourself. Advise 1.     Investigations – CBC, blood sugar (fasting & postprandial), HIV screening2.     Try to keep yourself clean 3.     Adopt proper hygienic practices such as bathing and cleaning with good quality soap4.     Wash your hand before taking food and after coming from toilet5.     Take high protein diet such as eggs, meat, cheese, vegetable and fruits6.     Take proper antibiotic after culture & sensitivity report7.     Do not use any antibiotic indiscriminately8.     Start workout in gymGood luck!"},{"Patient":"A bit paranoid because I'm not sure if I was exposed to toxic mold.  I was cleaning out the fridge because it was a little messy and throwing things away, but then I found a small container hidden in the back of my fridge and it was about half or 3/4 filled with a large quantity of of whitish/a little gray mold.  It also filled all the way to the top of the container as well. I spent about two hours trying to search online for what kind of mold it might be but there is many types of each toxic mold harmful to humans, and also a bit misleading because some have different colors too.  I've had some possible symptoms of what I've read on the internet, but no sure still if it's anything serious or what kind it was.  I read that inhaling the spores can cause problems, and I think I may have as the texture of the mold looked fuzzy, and I had opened it close up in my face not know what it was.  The symptoms I believe having minutes after were constant muscle twitching and spasms, I recall becoming very confused for a couple of moments when I was trying to Google more things and couldn't remember because of major confusions all of a sudden.  I have had tremors, dizziness, foot feeling like it was asleep/crawling under skin ( I was not sitting on it, I have moved it around often ) and I stood up and walked around a couple of minutes or so and the feeling was constant and didn't go away.. during and a little after that my foot experienced some numbness momentarily.  Then finally I've been getting this migraine and I have no had a migraine in over two years now, so I got something to eat and took a couple Excedrin migraine hoping that it goes away.

Thank you.","Doctor":"Hi there,Welcome to health care magic,I understand your concern regarding getting exposed to toxic mold but based on the details mentioned in your query I am suspecting paranoia about fungal exposure.Most common fungi which grow on food stuff are saprophytic fungi like zygomycetes and aspergilli.Most common symptom of inhalation of fungal spores is usually allergic asthma or respiratory symptoms like sneezing, wheeze and cough.The symptoms you mention indicate some kind of neurological weakness which needs to be examined and thoroughly investigated.Coming to your migraine, stress is the most common factor which triggers migraine.I suggest you quit worrying about fungal exposure and get the muscle twitching and spasms examined by a neurologist.Thanks."},{"Patient":"Hi Doc, I just received a copy of my visit to the ED, following an automobile accident on 5/28/17.

I am a healthy 66 year old female with no prior history of EKG abnormalities. I was extremely fortunate to be able to walk away with only chest pain and abdominal pain from both the seat belt and air bags that deployed. A small knot on the forehead without any LOC.

Subtle ECG changes like T wave abnormalities are common in women as part of normal changes. The other changes suggestive of anterior infarct could be of the normal process. The trauma can also cause the above changes. I advise my patients to follow up with fresh ECGs, to see normalization if any, and I would suggest getting evaluated by a cardiologist if there were persistent chest pain, with sweating and breathlessness.

Ive seen a few doctors, had blood tests, ultrasounds, and xrays done, but no one is able to tell me what is wrong. Ive been to a specialist and he has ruled out appendicitis and a few other things.  I am a 26 year old female and i dont know if this is of relevance but my partner and I have been trying for a baby for a year now. The stomach pains are more commonly in the morning, and i get a dark green stool too.  Do you know what could be causing this?  Thank you","Doctor":"Hello,the green stool and the pus from the belly do not seem to be related to each other. If the discharge is coming out of your umbilicus (the belly button) then this is omphalitis and has various causes. The exact cause can usually be identified with either an ultrasound scan or a CT scan. The treatment is surgical but it also requires administration of antibiotics. In mild cases antibiotics only and drainage may resolve it. If it's not the umbilicus then it's most likely a superficial infection or inflammation (carbuncle, infected cyst, etc). The treatment is the same. Green stool means faster passage of the intestinal content through the intestinal lumen. There are far too many causes to mention here. The most common ones is the patient's diet. Certain foods may stain the stool and make them look green. Iron supplements make the stool dark green (may look like black sometimes). Various causes of diarrhea may also cause green stools. More information is required for the investigation of this problem. I'll be glad to provide more clues, if you send more information about the quantity, consistency of the stool, how many bowel movements you have per day and the rest of your symptoms. Uploading any tests you've done will help a lot.I hope you find my comments helfpul!You can contact me again, if you'd like any clarification or further information.Kind Regards!"},{"Patient":"Hi,I have just got a letter through today telling me I have Severe Dyskaryosis..

In way to decrease the risk of overwhelming postsplenectomy infections, you should be revaccinated at the appropriate time interval for each vaccine.You should repeat the vaccine against Streptococcus pneumoniae (Pneumovax 23) every 6 years, and the vaccine against Neisseria meningitidis (Menactra or Menomune-A/C/Y/W-135) every 3-5 years. Mean while the vaccine against Haemophilus influenzae type B (HibTITER) has no need to be repeated.Taking an antibiotic every daily basis can significantly reduce the risk of infection, but this is more recommended in children. As the adults, have a low risk of sepsis (severe and potentially life-threatening condition in which infection-causing bacteria spread throughout the bloodstream and/or tissues and impair normal body functions), the value of daily antibiotic treatment for adults is debated. I would suggest you to take the antibiotic at the first sign of infection, such as fever, chills, sore throat, or cough, and to see an infections diseases doctor immediately after that.Regarding the work, if you can find an alternative job with less contact with the patients, it would be better for your health.

It may be considered normal for one to have sweating in the armpit area to the extent that it makes the cloth over the area wet.

Infliximab is usually not known to cause the side effect of excessive sweating from the armpit.

I would like to find out more about this infection as the specialist said that it was very serious.   Can you provide me with information? Many thanks","Doctor":"Hi,    I have read your query and understand your concern. Mycobacterium kansasii infection is quite similar to TB or tuberculosis caused by mycobacterium tuberculosis. Their symptoms are also quite similar. Patient infected with Mycobacterium kansasii develops symptoms like cough and coughing up sputum. Some people develop blood tinged sputum. Few people have weight loss and find it difficult to breath.Some other symptoms are fever and sweating at night.        It tends to infect people with previous damaged lungs due to other conditions like COPD, TB, bronchiectasis, etc. It can also infect people with weak immune system like in HIV/AIDS. Your doctor might have told its dangerous as it can spread to brain causing meningitis as well.        But you need not worry so much. Mycobacterium kansasii can respond well to combined drug treatment of rifampicin, ethambutol and isoniazid. If its resistant to rifampicin, then other drugs are used.

They at 1st itched, & do NOT now. I put Bacitracin ointment on them. They seem to be disappearing. I have had sexual contact this past Sunday, the 19th. They developed on Mon., the 20th. I would hope that this is not the beginning of Shingles. What could these possibly be??","Doctor":"Hi,   I have read about your concern. Thanks for asking. Let me tell you one thing about shingles. They are not sexually transmitted. Shingles are caused by a virus called Herpes zoster, the same virus which causes chickenpox which might be well known to you. Shingles only occurs in people who have had previous episode of chickenpox probably in childhood.         In people who have chickenpox in childhood, the virus enters nerve cells in body called dorsal root ganglia. There it stays dormant. When the persons immune system is weakened, it gets reactivated and develops into shingles.         Also it is restricted to only certain areas where that particular nerve supplies the skin called dermatomes. It doesnt occur in the way you have mentioned like red marks. Shingles has many blisters or vesicles. So dont at all worry about shingles.You might have developed some allergy to some clothes or due to excessive sweating. Just try to avoid clothes that irritate you. Try to keep the area with red rashes dry without getting wet with sweat. It will mostly resolve by itself. As bacitracin ointment has worked on them, you can continue applying it.If it doesn't resolve in few days, visit your dermatologist."},{"Patient":"Good Day! I was recently diagnosed at 21yrs (4months after losing my virginity) with CIN2 after abnormal pap smear and subsequent colposcopy. I have only had sex with 1 person.  I engage in vaginal and oral sex. I want to know what are the chances of having cell changes in the neck region as well? And what is the risk of gettting head and neck cancers from hpv? Also is it safe to still engage in oral sex with my boyfriend at this point (protection or no protection)? Thank you in advance.","Doctor":"Hi,    You said that you have been diagnosed with CIN2. It is an abnormality of cells in cervix that can lead to cervical cancer if left untreated. CIN2 means between 1/3rd and 2/3rd cells in cervix are transformed onto abnormal cells. It is caused by Human papilloma virus (HPV). HPV doesn't lead to any changes in your neck. Certain types of HPV causes cervical cancer and certain types of HPV causes genital warts. HPV does cause oropharyngeal cancer. But it generally occurs in males above 40 years of age. So, its quite uncommon in a young woman like you. No need to worry about it.As you already have developed HPV infection, you need not be worried about getting new HPV infection from your boyfriend. But always make sure to use protection like condoms. They protect you from all kind of sexually transmitted infections like chlamydia, HIV, syphilis, etc. And coming to the treatment part, your gynecologist will perform some procedure like laser therapy, freezing therapy (cryotherapy) to remove the abnormal cells. She might also use LLETZ (a procedure using a loop of wire) to remove or scrape out the abnormal cells.Also make sure to undergo repeat testing of pap smear and colposcopy after 6 months of having treatment for your CIN2."},{"Patient":"hello, i have a painful spot on my stump from something rubbing down there, and i have been putting up with a sinus infection for about 6 days which is also painful on and off, i was wondering if this is a good time to go. the spot rubbed raw is open and i am very pron to infections.","Doctor":"You're describing a sinus which is a fibrous tissue track that is being filled with pus or secretion that is the time when it's painful and the pain is relieved when it's emptied...You have to be examined by a surgeon"},{"Patient":"a female 62years old,suferring from filaria since 6 to 7 years.chief complains are-swelling  whole body,pain, oozing is stop now ,dyspnoea, ,unable to walk,but when oozing stop the condition of patient  worse with fever,n etc.  now she is not taking any treatment .plz suggest us what should we do?","Doctor":"Hello, Thanks for asking the question.

Though she continues treatment the healing ratio is very slow and she is having seer pain due to that....Pls advice to recover from that also how to avoid the same infection on other locations as well","Doctor":"HI, thanks for using healthcare magicIt must be difficult for her to be in so much pain consistently.The doctor may need to rule out an abscess in the area, this is a small collection of pus. If this is present, it would need to be incised for healing to occur.If there is no abscess, then treatment would involve : (a) improving generalized health by rest, using multivitamin supplement and controlling any other illnesses such as diabetes(b)applying warm compress to the area, this would also help with pain(c)a swab may need to be taken to make sure the correct antibiotic is being used(d)cleaning with an antiseptic soap or cleanser . Anti septic soaps can also be applied to other areas of the body as well(e)applying topical antibiotic and using an oral antibiotic as well(f) anti inflammatory pain killers would help with the discomfort eg ibuprofen, cataflam, naproxenI hope this helps"},{"Patient":"Hi my 7 and a half year old daughter has just been sick and appeared to have bits of fresh blood in it, only little bits like membrain when u sometimes blow your nose.

Please type your query here...Um hi my name is april and today i had gone to the medi center by my house, um yesterday evening i went to go and pull out my nuca ring to clean it since i was supposed to put in during my cycle, at this time when itook out the nuva ring i had found a tampon my cycle by then was finished for about two days.. i stopped using tampons because i ran out within my second day and started using pads. so i figured out that i had this tampon in up by my cervix for about five days.. the doctor at the medi center said not to worry even though i was having chest pains, sharp pains over all of my body having random bouts were i was being coming light headed and my right arm even went numb.. he put me on antibiotics though since he found that i had bronticis.. and im just wondering that if there is any infection caused by the tampon for being into long would the antibiotics that i am currently on help fight off any infection that may be there","Doctor":"Hi, Thanks for posting in the HCM. I have read your description and understand your concern. Tampon should be removed as early as possible, as left alone could lead to dreadful infection called 'toxic shock syndrome'. It would be ideal to be treated for infection, irrespective of weather it is evident or not, by taking a course of appropriate antibiotics. It would be better to get the contraceptive ring removed temporarily until the infection subsides and then can be inserted, once the issues are stabilized. Until then other modes of contraception can be used, if necessary. It would be better to abstain from sexual activities during this period till the infection gets completely cured. Kindly consult Gynecologist for these issues to be resolved. Based on the symptoms you are experiencing, it would be better that you can get thoroughly checked-up from Physician, and can be treated accordingly, if necessary. Hope the information provided would be helpful. All the best."},{"Patient":"I am 40 years of age and having only 30 kg. weight. I am suffering from fever for about 12 days.

I got the results from a test I took a couple of weeks ago testing for STDs. I tested positive for ureaplasma parvum, though I have none of its symptoms. Is this dangerous? Should I treat it or will it pass by itself? And is it dangerous to my female parter? Can it spread through oral sex or sex with a condom?Thanks","Doctor":"Hi, Thanks for posting in HCM. I understand your concern. Ureaplasma parvum is a pathogenic ureolytic mollicute (mycoplasma) commonly found in healthy and diseased humans. It has been identified as being a commensal in the uterus as part of the microbiome in healthy women of reproductive age. It has been categorized as a mucosal parasite living within the genito-urinary tracts. It is not necessary to treat all cases which are tested positive and when there are no symptoms associated with it. When the general immunity decreases, infection can flare up. Spread of organism can happen with sexual contact  and also by direct contact with infected material. Hence, it would be better to take proper precautions while having sexual contact.

Please type your query here...Can you tell me how kids get impentigo? Not sure if I spelled it right but they have been to the doc andthey say it is very contagice not sure how the are getting it or what causes it???","Doctor":"Hi, Thanks for posting in HCM. I understand your concern. Impetigo is a highly contagious skin condition. It usually occurs on the face, neck, and hands of young children and infants. It is a bacterial infection caused by two bacteria — streptococcus pyogenes and staphylococcus aureus. There are several different types: 1. Impetigo contagiosa (also called nonbullous impetigo) -  most common type in children, highly contagious. This type of impetigo usually begins with red sores around the nose and mouth. 2. Bullous impetigo - most common in children below 2 years. Blisters usually appear first on the torso, arms and legs. 3. Ecythma - most serious form of impetigo. It affects the second layer (layer beneath) of the skin. Blisters tend to be painful and may turn into ulcers, or open sores. Swollen lymph nodes and scars may also occur. Treatment for impetigo depends on the severity of the symptoms as well as the type of bacteria causing the impetigo. In mild cases of impetigo, simple hygiene methods would help the skin heal and prevents impetigo from spreading. Inn case infection is severe, topical antibiotics and oral antibiotics needs to be administered. Hope the information provided would be helpful.

The doctor needs to test you specifically for hepatitis B antigen to see if you are currently infected. Not having enough antibody means that you have not responded to the vaccine yet.

Bad smell from mouth could be due to many reasons related and unrelated to dental diseases. It could be due to dental infections, gum disease, sinus problem, food habits, inadequate oral hygiene etc. In addition, kidney disease can also cause bad breath from mouth.Thus, I would advise you to wait till the results of your test come. If they indicate presence of kidney disease, then you can start treatment for the disease and the bad breath will eliminate on recovery from the disease. If the test shows negative for any pathology, you should visit a dentist to look for presence of dental infections or gum problems. Treatment of the disease can sure such problem. By the time the underlying cause is detected and treated, you can use mouthwash containing Chlorhexidine such as Colgate Plax or Hexidine. You can take 10 ml of liquid and squish it around mouth for about 30 seconds before spitting it. Take care no to use immediately after brushing teeth and do not eat or drink anything for half an hour after its use. Brush twice a day and use dental floss to clean interdental spaces.

Is lower back and flank pain common with UCTD?","Doctor":"Welcome to HCM.People with undifferentiated connective tissue disease are often misdiagnosed or are diagnosed late. I will try to help you as much as possible here. There is a chance that this pain is related to UCTD, but it is pertinent that we rule out other causes of back/flank pain. If the back pain is because of kidney infection, it sould present with fever. If the flank pain is severe and episodic, it could be because of a stone in the ureter. The first investigations that we do are urinalysis and ultrasound. If they show nothing, then CT scan is done as ultrasound can miss about 40% of ureteric stones, even when done by a very competent professional. If there are no findings on the CT scan, then we can begin to entertain the idea that it is because of UCTD.I would recommend that you visit your physician regarding this problem and schedule an appointment with a urologist and a rheumatologist.Thank you for giving us the opportunity to help you. Please feel free to ask if you have any pther questions.

Also, even worse if you do your belt up before washing your hands and say later in the day you want to adjust your belt (which you don't wash in the washing machine) it would be disgusting. I wash my hands before and after I pull up my trousers, when doing a number 2, just to make sure.

So would you wash your hands when you take off/put on your trousers/pants/skirt or whatever. I know this is a different question, but you know these thoughts suddenly come into your head, as you get older.

Physiotherapy plays an important role. Usually it takes 3-6 months. If he is able to swallow food on his own, then oral diet is encouraged rather than IV  fluids. Otherwise, nasogastric intubation is an option before going for IV fluids. IV fluids can be administered depending upon his hydration status which should be monitored daily by urine output & vitals monitoring.Thank you for contacting healthcare magic.I hope, you are satisfied by the answer"},{"Patient":"hello, m madhavi, intern at JLN hospital, my father is having dull pain at right hypochondriac and periumblical region off and on since six months. pain was prominent before meals.endoscopy was done which revealed esophageal candidiasis and fluconazole*14 days OD was given but pain is still persisting and increasing in frequency. plz guide me about the illness: diagnosis and treatment.","Doctor":"hiWelcome to HCMi had gone through your father's history and i can understand your concern towards your dad Madavi,Candidiasis  is a fungal infection caused by yeasts from the genus Candida.

COuld I of had this for awhile and not known or gave it to anyone? I had a severe mouth infection on the inside with sores inside mouth mostly on tongue was put on Valtrex for that,,, could this be latter of that? can I still have oral sex?","Doctor":"Hi, Thanks for posting in HCM. I understand your concern. Genital herpes is a disease caused by the herpes simplex virus (HSV). HSV is of two types: 1. Type 1 (HSV-1), which usually causes oral herpes in the form of infection of the lips and mouth. Symptoms are commonly known as cold sores or fever blisters. In the past, HSV-1 was not known to cause genital herpes, but that is changing, especially among people who begin having sex at a young age. 2. Type 2 (HSV-2), which, in most cases, causes genital herpes. HSV-1 is usually passed from person to person by kissing. HSV-1 can also spread from the mouth to the genitals during oral sex. If infection occurs, it becomes a case of genital herpes.HSV-2 is most often passed by vaginal sex and anal sex. But just as HSV-1 can infect the genitals and cause genital herpes, HSV-2 can pass from one person's genitals to another person's mouth, resulting in oral herpes. Hence, HSV-1 can also be transmitted to the genitals through oral/genital sex and about 40% of genital herpes is caused by HSV-1. It would be advisable not to have oral sex at this stage as it carries a risk for transmission of infection. Hope the information provided would be helpful. All the best."},{"Patient":"my hand had to be cauterized due to severe bleeding that lasted over 3 hours.  silver nitrate sticks were used to stop the bleeding.

No, it does not sound like cancer so please do not worry about it. Cancerous growths are usually painless to start with. What you are suffering from seems like a viral infection only that has infected your tongue and throat mainly while causing generalized ill ease due to the infection. I would advise you to visit a dentist or ENT surgeon and go for culture of the swab after taking sample from the affected area with the swab. The culture results will show what kind of organisms are associated with the infection and what medicines can be started to clear the infection. Based on that, the treatment can be started. As it is an infection of viral or bacterial origin, it will not go away by itself and will surely need treatment.I hope this answer helps you. Thank you for choosing HCM.

Antiviral therapy can help to reach that stage which he may have started after finding out that he has HPV infection.I hope this information helps you. Thank you for choosing HCM.

I feel you are having anxiety disorder. You need to follow some lifestyle tips1. Connect with others: Loneliness and isolation set the stage for anxiety. Decrease your vulnerability by reaching out to others. Make it a point to see friends, join a self-help or support group, or share your worries and concerns with a trusted loved one.2. Practice relaxation techniques: When practiced regularly, relaxation techniques such as mindfulness meditation, progressive muscle relaxation, and deep breathing can reduce anxiety symptoms and increase feelings of relaxation and emotional well-being.3. Exercise regularly: Exercise is a natural stress buster and anxiety reliever. To achieve the maximum benefit, aim for at least 30 minutes of aerobic exercise on most days.4. Get enough sleep: A lack of sleep can exacerbate anxious thoughts and feelings, so try to get seven to nine hours of quality sleep a night. If you struggle with sleep, adopting smart sleep habits can make a big difference.5. Be smart about caffeine and alcohol: If you struggle with anxiety, you may want to consider reducing your caffeine intake or cutting it out completely. Same with alcohol, which can make anxiety worse.6. Train your brain to stay calm: Worrying is a mental habit you can learn how to break. Strategies such as creating a worry period, challenging anxious thoughts, and learning to accept uncertainty can significantly reduce anxiety and fear.7. If you have anxiety that’s severe enough to interfere with your ability to function, medication may help relieve your symptoms. You need to visit a psychiatrist who will help you with medicationsregards- Dr Sanjay Kini"},{"Patient":"I just had surgery on a pilonidal sinus. I've had the sinus recur about a dozen times and had been given an acid cream. Just recently I was told what the condition is and surgery was recommended. I'm a bit horrified at this now that I know more about it. I'm eager to prevent future flareups. I have very very little body hair. My mother, however, had a cyst under her arm (treated with radiation) and I too have had one of those (healed on its own).

I need super explicit advice about how to avoid these, especially since I have a desk job and I watch tv in the evenings quite often. What specific postures are best? Is getting up every half hour or hour (at the office) enough? And regarding cleanliness, I shower every day but should I use alcohol clean wipes or what else on this area? It appears at some websites that soap is not the best thing though I rinse thoroughly. Are snug (not tight) jeans a problem? Should I discard all nylon underwear?

I have read your description and understand your concern. Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infection is caused by a type of staph bacteria that is resistant to many of the antibiotics used to treat ordinary staph infections.

You are right in your information that oral thrush can be a symptom of AIDS. However, ARS (Acute Retroviral Syndrome) does not consist of only oral thrush. It is a syndrome, comprising various ailments such as sore throat, joint pain, fever with no plausible explanation, rash, headache etc. Thus, even if you can be confirmed for being HIV negative after 3 months, you might not have AIDS. In addition, if you had only unprotected oral sex, transmission of HIV through oral sex route is rare. It usually transmits through vaginal sex and blood transmission. You might get other STDs faster than HIV through having sex this way.Now regarding your thrush problem, you may change the medicine to Fluconazole (Fole) 150 mg once a day for 10 days and avoid carbohydrates in food along with improved oral hygiene.

You require radical cure of malaria if you did not take then.Radical cure can be treated by taking primaquine for 14 days. Additionally, you have to take preventive and control measures such as wearing full sleaves shirt and pant, use of insecticide treated net is the only method which gives 100 percent protection from mosquito bites.I would like to advice you to take complete treatment in order prevent resistance of drug to parasite.

History of nail bite is characteristic of paronychia which is a infection of nail of finger.If I would start treatment empirically by giving antibiotics Tab.cefadroxyl 500 mg 1 twice a day for 5-7  days .Additionally wound care is utmost importance. Antibiotics treatment will make pus sterile and pus needs to be drained.To prevent pain from occurring, pus can be drained under use of local anaesthetics injection around the affected area. I would also recommend you to check blood sugar level in order to rule out diabetes. Wound dressing and care is also importance for healing .I would suggest you to consult your doctor and get the treatment done I hope this has answered your question.If you have further questions,feel free to ask .RegardsDr.Hamid"},{"Patient":"Hi, may I answer your health queries right now ?

I have read your description and understand your concern. Pneumonia is an infection in the lungs. It can be caused by bacteria, fungi or viruses. Pneumonia causes inflammation in the lung's air sacs (alveoli). Alveoli gets filled with fluid or pus, making it difficult to breathe and exchange of gases (oxygen and carbon dioxide) across.With treatment, most types of bacterial pneumonia will stabilize in 3–6 days. In severe forms, if the response is poor to the treatment, it leads to decreased oxygen in the body (hypoxia), increased carbon dioxide retention leading to respiratory acidosis, which could damage vital organs like brain, liver and kidneys. Eventually, it will lead to multi-organ failure and death. Mortality may be as high as 10% in severe forms of pneumonia, and in those requiring intensive care it may reach 30 – 50%.

Best wishes."},{"Patient":"hello doctor on being suspected of a dog bite i took 5 doses of anti rabies vaccine (0,3,7.14.28),in the month of october 2013 but in jan i went of one persons house where his dog came close to me i am scared as to wether the dog licked me or not ,i am confused and afraid . should i take 2 doses of rabies vaccine (0,3) for safety.will there be any harm to me for taking vaccine so frequently.","Doctor":"Hi, Thanks for posting in HCM.

There is puss and feces coming out of my navel and doctors have given me countless amounts of antibiotics and creams treating it as an infection ... I have had it catoized .. burnt shut ... and its back.  What do I do .","Doctor":"Brief Answer:You need a surgical intervention to repair the abdominal wall defect and to reset the normal passage of the feces through the intestine .Detailed Answer:Hello,Thank you for using HCM.You need a surgical intervention to repair the abdominal wall defect and to reset the normal passage of the feces through the intestine . You have developed an umbilical hernia (the intestine or other tissues bulge through this weak spot around the belly button, umbilicus), which has become bigger over time, and infected. The infection has perforated the walls of the intestine, making possible the feces and pus, to come out from the navel. In these conditions the surgical reparation is inevitable. The open procedure and under general anesthesia is the most adequate in your case , eventhough you should see a surgeon to decide about the type of surgery, preoperatory preparatios, and folow up plan.You should understand that is really indispensable that you undergo the surgery, because the infection may affect all your general health and it may also develop even a more serious condition called strangulation. Strangulation occurs when the blood flow to certain parts of the body is suddenly cut off. Symptoms of strangulation include nausea, vomiting, and severe pain. The area around the umbilical hernia might look blue, as if you have a bruise. Hope this is helpful.Let me know if you need more clarifications. Otherwise please close and rate the answer.Kind Regards, Dr. Juarda"},{"Patient":"I had a hysterectomy 2 days ago.  I have severe cramping in my lower abdomin and lower back.

The virus ultimately reaches skin and mucosal surfaces resulting in skin rash and vesicles. This infection once occurs gives immunity for life time. Most probably, in your case, you have had chicken pox in childhood and that has protected you against reinfection.It is very rare for reinfection to occur in adults and is more common in adults with immunocompromise.I suggest you take healthy food and maintain your immunity by taking multivitamin supplements.Avoid direct contact with the vesicles.Thanks."},{"Patient":"My yeast infection won't go away I had a many antibiotics for stds I had n now this uncurable yeast infection won't go away I'm starting to think I was born with it my dumb ass mom probably pass it to me and she gave it to me n now I'm just realizing that what can I do no doctors can find a cure for it and now I get these rashes behind my leg and under my breast for some reason idk if its cause of my yeast infection","Doctor":"Hi,Welcome to HCM.Rashes in areas where more sweating occurs is caused by fungal infection but not necessarily yeasts. Most common fungi causing such infection are dermatophytes or tinea. These infections are not hereditary.

I suggest you get in touch with a dermatologist and get antifungal therapy prescribed based on the test results.Mind you, antifungal therapy needs to be continued for at least 6 weeks to 3 months.

First of all thank you for sharing your concern with us and showing trust on us.Interferon are not used in treatment of thrombocytopenia but they are used in essential thrombocythemia . So I am quite sure after analyzing your question that you are having essential thrombocythemia not thrombocytopenia.  Treatment of essential thrombocythemia differs from person to person depending on individual risks of blood clotting and previous medical history.If a person is younger than 60 years and has no symptoms and has no previous blood clots , TIA , high cholesterol , diabetes and hypertension then periodic medical check ups are needed only . But if a person is older than 60 , had blood clot in past , TIA , HYPERCHOLESTEROLEMIA ,Hpertension , diabetes then medications should be started. A low dose aspirin with hydroxyurea or anagrelide or interferon alpha or PIF Alpha 2 a are best options . All medicines have some side effects but your healthcare providers prescribe any medicine because the benefits are higher than any possible side effects. As far as interferon rtherapy is concerned so I would like to inform you that it is one of the best medicines and you should continue as your healthcare providers have prescribed.

Went under anesthesia and suddenly his blood pressure went down to 40!! skin became red Had to stop. told us he was allergic to vecuronium (muscle relaxer) they think !! Now we need to find out what drugs made his allergic, this vecuronium or something else. Have a list of 20 meds they gave him before, during and after surgery. Our surgeon cannot find an allergist that can test for these drugs. Where do I go. Wonder if the Anesthesiologist did something wrong and Doctors are covering up.

So dangerous for any patient to undergo this and it could have been fatal.","Doctor":"Hi, Hypersensitivity associated with histamine release leading to allergic reactions may occur, and in rare instances, life-threatening anaphylaxis  (causing hypotension) may occur with vecuronium.

Before having this procedure, I had slightly raised cholesterol, but not high enough for medication. Over the last three years my Total Cholesterol level has gradually increased from 5.4 to now 7.1 My Bad cholestrol is very high, but my good cholesterol is VERY good, I don t have the exact figures. My Dr put me on Simvastatin approx three years ago. I took them willingly, and carried on my life as best I could, not realising how tiered and exhausted they made me feel with lots of aches and pains, I thought my problems where early menopause. Anyway last year after much research on the internet, I discovered that statins could give bad side affect in concentration and tiredness and muscle weakness, so I decided to address this with my Dr. Who instead of listening, gave me another tablet to take on top of the statins, because my cholesterol had started to rise again. (Sorry don t have the name of this one) I took these for a month, and they made me almost incapable of getting out of bed, the tiredness was so debilitating. I decided to stop taking them, and the Simvastatins. So I gradually weaned myself off of the drugs. I had decided not to tell the Dr, so I did it on my own. Anyway, when I went back to the Dr about something else a few months later, I told them what I had done, they strongly advised me to take another type of Statin. This time Atrovastatin 10mg was to be taken. I said I would but if they made me feel bad, I would stop them straight away. I took them for 10 days and started to get all the same side effects so just stopped, and the Dr could not persuade me to re take them. Then this year I have had a cholesterol test, and I am now showing a total of 7.1 When they told me how high it was, I said I didn’t care, because Id rather die tomorrow, than spend any more time taking these drugs. Anyhow they persuaded me to have one more try, and have given me Fluvastatin 20mg. That was nearly a month ago, and I haven’t talked myself into starting to take them yet, but would just like some general advice about High Cholesterol. Does high cholesterol mean that I’m going to have a heart attack or does it just mean I might? I do have heart problems in my family, my mother died at 48 of a massive stroke, but she was very over weight, and my father has just been prescribed Simvastins, for his high cholesterol, and he like me now, is a very slight man, he is 74 years old, and has developed Altzimers. He has also started to complain about tiredness and weakness ( possibly the same side effects as me). He does not eat a lot of high fat foods, and often forgetting to eat at all unless it is put infront of him. Can cholesterol really be inherited? What can I do? I live in the Mediterranean most of the time, so I feel my life style is very healthy. I eat plenty of fruit and veg, I drink moderately and do not smoke. We cant get takeaway food here, so nearly everything is prepared from scratch. My only vice is butter, and that is only when I m worrying about all this. Is there any alternatives to Statins, I did read something about a dialysis machine for cholesterol? But that was a long time ago, and was in the early stage of development. Should I try these next ones, or just forget it and see what happens. I like my life now, When I was on the Simvastatins, I felt I had no life at all, almost like I was taking part in someone else s life, not quite mine. I don t want to go back to feeling like that. Please help....","Doctor":"Hi, You are 47 years old and having high cholesterol. do not worry. Myalgias are common problems with statins. To minimize the aches, you can start on Rosuvastatin or Atorvastatin. If possible stop butter completely. Never dialysis is done for hyperlipidemia. Hope I have answered your query.

Ordinary bee stings that do not cause much of an allergic reaction. Multiple stings or an allergic reaction, on the other hand, can be a medical emergency that requires immediate treatment. In your case, kindly wash the area with soap and water, and apply cold compresses or ice pack.For pain, you need to take an over-the-counter painkiller like Ibuprofen.For itchiness, take an antihistamine like Levocetrizine. You can also apply a mixture of baking soda and water or calamine lotion on the lesion to reduce the swelling. Avoid scratching the sting area.

Thanks","Doctor":"Hi dear Thanks for choosing Health care magic The burning sensation you developed could be a sign of a disease known as Peripheral Neuropathy, this diseases causes tingling and burning sensation in hands and feet among other symptoms.Peripheral Neuropathy can be caused by some viruses such as namely Herpes Simplex or Herpes Zoster,,, however it can also be caused by antibiotics used to treat UTI and respiratory infections.Since you mentioned that you are currently on antibiotics for UTI then it's highly likely that your symptoms is due to the antibiotics you are given Group of antibiotics that are known as fluroquinolones namely Ciprofloxin and levofloxin could lead to peripheral neuropathy in some patients..My advice for you is to check what antibiotics you are taking, if it's Ciprofloxin  or levofloxin or other antibiotics in the group of Fluroquinolones then stop immediately and go to Doctor to give you an alternative antibiotic medicine such as Azithromycin or Amoxicillin (make sure to tell the doctor if you previously had allergy to any antibiotic group)...Peripheral neuropathy could be a reversible disease and in some patients it can disappear by it self in months or so, hopefully you will be fine soon..If you have more questions don't hesitate to ask ..Wish you all the best"},{"Patient":"Hi, I was diagnosed with late stage lyme disease last november. My knee swelled up and had been hurting for awhile (there was no rash). After going through a month of doxycycline, my knee swelling went down. A few months later my wrist started to swell up and a rash appeared on my inner thigh. I was put on doxycycline again for one week and both symptoms went away. Now my elbow is staring to hurt and I'm afraid it's Lyme Disease again. Is there such a thing as reoccurring Lyme disease? How common is it, and does it get more and more dangerous each time? I'm scared that if it keeps coming back, one of these times it will go to my brain.","Doctor":"Hello.  Lyme disease scares a lot of people and doctors often disagree about what to do about it.  The answer to this question is not simple.First of all, it depends on where you live.  If you live somewhere where Lyme is very common like the Northeast United States then you may be likely to get infected over and over.  This is why it is important to protect yourself with ticks with clothing and repellent and also to check yourself for ticks regularly (I suggest in the shower).Lyme can come back if you are reinfected and it needs to be treated each time.  I don't believe there is any evidence it would get worse each time or that it would be more likely to go to your brain.  Lyme meningitis (when it goes \\"to your brain\\") is something that would start with symptoms usually and can be treated just like Lyme in other stages.I wouldn't be scared but at this point I would consider seeing an infectious disease doctor for their opinion as it's sometimes hard to sort these things out by a primary care doctor.  Certainly if you have fever, neck stiffness, muscle aches or other signs of Lyme you should be seen sooner than later.Take care,Dr D"},{"Patient":"My husband has had sinus and allergy problems for over 20 years....has been to Mayo numerous times...seen various doctors and most recently an ENT.

What you are describing can be shortly described as severe numbness all over your body including oral cavity.

How can I stop the horrible itching and pain?","Doctor":"dear patient,i have understand your question and your problem. the main side effect of florinef is it causes fluid accumulation in the body leading to edema in the feet and it also weakens your immune system due which you developed infection in your toes.it is also known to cause diabetes so i advice you to get your sugar levels checked. i advice you to go back to the original dose of florinef and dont stop it immediatly if you have been taking it more than a week. the drug needs to be slowly tapered off.till then apply bactroban ointment on your toes after washing and drying with a disinfectant soap.and contact your doctor to prescribe an alternate medicine accordingly."},{"Patient":"Hi, I am 39 and was diagnosed with mono 3 weeks ago.

As the nutrition improves in the right direction,thereby immunity also improves and your symptoms will resolve fast.

Your sister must also be treated in the same way as you require in order to get cured.As athlete foot is contagious and occurs in who walk on barefoot ,I would like to suggest you some preventive measure apart from treatment part to prevent recurrence.1) Wash your feet daily, and dry the skin between your toes thoroughly after washing. This is perhaps the most important point. The soggy skin between the toes is then ideal for fungi to grow.2)Don’t share socks, shoes, or towels with others3)wear sandals in public showers, around public swimming pools, and in other public places4)Wear socks made out of breathable fibers, such as cotton or wool, or made out of synthetic fibers that wick moisture away from your skinchange your socks when your feet get sweatyPlease feel free to contact me at any time if you have any queries.As it is a skin problem, I would like to visit your dermatologist to seek an expert opinion.Regards,Dr.A.HamidFamily Physician and Preventive care Consultant"},{"Patient":"Hi,My boyfriend has hep c and has stopped drinking.  However, he has slipped a couple of times.  He did last night.  Now he has been throwing up stomach acid and is extremely uncomfortable in the roof of his mouth with burning (extreme)  still nausua from drinking also.  Unable to keep anything down.  Help me please","Doctor":"Hello,I can understand your concern. As you know, nausea and vomiting after excessive drinking is an after-effect of alcohol consumption. The effects are heightened because your friend is suffering from Hepatitis and his liver is not capable of taking this load of metabolism of alcohol. If he wants to prevent complications in future, he will have to be very careful not to use alcohol.The burning roof of mouth may be due to exposure of the area to excessive acid present in the vomit. It can cause sore palate which may burn. Topical application of Benzocaine Gel like Mucopain can help to have relief in that area.Take care that he stays hydrated by drinking plenty of water to prevent dehydration due to vomiting. In addition, if the symptoms do not improve in some hours, he should consult a physician to check for complications related to Hepatitis C.I hope this information helps you.

The week after the trauma it would turn bright red in the evening.(  While making dinner)  Now , 9 days later I have a painful filled sack between the knuckles ( size of Quarter) .  Do I need to follow up with doc?","Doctor":"Brief Answer:You should see a surgeon.Detailed Answer:Hello,Thank you for using HCM.Generally the subcutaneous hematomas after trauma does reabsorb by them self's within three weeks or less. The color changes from that of a purplish-blue bruise to yellow and brown as the blood chemicals gradually are metabolized and the hematoma resolves. In case of persistence and organisation within a sack, as in your case, then should be done an ecography and then should be evaluated by a surgeon. The surgeon will evaluate the possibility to drain it by opening up the area (either to insert a needle or catheter-type device) . As it hurts , may be the hematoma is infected because it is a favorable place for bacteria to grow. You should take some oral antiinflamator drugs such as ibuprofen tablets 400 mg , 3 times a day after meals or diclofenac tablets 75 mg , 2 times a day after meal. Your surgeon, after visiting you, will decide for draining or not and if you need any additional therapy with antibiotics or not.Hope this is helpful.Let me know if you need more clarifications.

I've had the flu back in January and I'm now sick again with practically the same symptoms -- except that this time it is much worse!

When will I start getting better?","Doctor":"HELLO.I AM sorry to hear about your problem.H3N1 virus is just a new variant of H1N1 virus which is a swine flu virus spread to humans from pigs and birds.And since its a viral infection your immune system will kill it within 7-10 days maximum and you will start to feel better.Add acetaminophen 500 3-4 times daily for your pains. Take high protein foods,lots of fluids and rest.The important point to remember here that if your breathing becomes worse and the cough doesnt decrease by 2 weeks than i recommend you to get admitted in hospital for special care.Any way the flu in this season is not that strong and i have noticed a lot of patients getiing better by 1-2 weeks. hope this answers the question."},{"Patient":"so I had a yeast infection and I used monistat and it gave me relief but I didn't use it as directions said even tho I did use all of it I thought I had gotten rid of it but two days later it came back and ive had it for almost two months now is there a possibility I have an STD?","Doctor":"hello, recurring yeast infection is a sign that your immunity system is weak, or probably you are taking to much sugars or antibiotics in your diet. candida albicans,yeast, normally grow in female genital tract, and when the immunity system is weak the yeast overpopulation the genital area, becoming harmful. i would command same exams to exclude other STD, properly treatment of yeast with econazole 150mg /ovule for six nights, and what is most important you have to maintain a healthy diet, and taking supplements to improve your immunity.   all the best.dr.Klo"},{"Patient":"i walked smack into a thick piece of glass (the corner), knocked me silly for a few minutes and turned red. the next day there was no redness, no mark. now, 3 or 4 days later, the spot reallyhurts and it feels like there is a cavert or hole, maybe an inveerted bump?","Doctor":"dear patient.not to worry.Its just a process of healing due to damage that happened internally due to injury.Because injury was hidden it didnt give redness that much.

I have read your description and understand your concern. HCG is a hormone, which maintains the pregnancy. If its levels are low during especially in the 1st trimester, there are more chances of abortion. Hence, it is recommended to take injections regularly, especially during 1st 3 months. Based on the follicular study, it appears that the maturity of follicles seem to be good and Hucog has been administered at right time. Follicles would be ready for rupture in about 24 to 48 hours following injection.Kindly have intercourse for 3 to 5 days following injection, which should improve the chance for conceiving.

The fact that they are stable is related to the fact that they are not enhanced on DWI images (a specific MRI technique), which means that they are older than three months.

A recent US showed 4 benign cysts. 6.8cm,2.4cm.1.6cn on interpolar left and 1.7cm on parapelvic right. All have grown since my last US 2 years ago. My creatinine is 1.69. I have had 3 episodes of PE s, 4 episodes of DVT s in 4 years. I am now on warfarin with INR 2.9. I have spinal stenosis from an old L1 burst fracture. I have lower back leg pain and muscle cramps. I m concerned about complications if I have the cysts aspirated. Managing the pain requires quite a bit of narcotic pain meds which cause constipation and then additional pain. Could the aspiration reduce the pain level? What other concerns could the procedure cause?","Doctor":"Hi, Cysts aspiration may definitely give you symptomatic relief. These large cysts may press on the pelvic structures and I am suspecting that these have caused pressure on ureters since long contributing to urine outflow obstruction and therefore deranged creatinine. Apart from this, these also cause pressure on the pelvic venous plexuses causing venous stasis and thus prone you to DVT and PE risk. As you are on Warfarin, cysts aspiration like any other surgical procedure carries some risk like hemorrhage into the cyst or intra-abdominal bleeding. However, it can be managed by adjusting or stopping the Warfarin peri-operatively and bridging it with IV Heparin. Don't forget to restart Warfarin after no issues with bleeding, after the procedure because a second episode of PE may occur as you have already experienced one. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further.

Empiric treatment of symptoms, with probiotics, like lactobacillus every 8 hours, or other, Hioscina bromuro every 8 hours, and metoclopramide every 8 hours.4.After getting results, maybe specific treatment like antibiotics, if there is a bacterial infection, would be needed.

At first, many viral infections cause, fever, cough (with a little of blood, because of the force, when you cough) and chest pain (because of a viral pericarditis, which is normal in some type of virus). But if you keep with symptoms, and fever for 5 days or more, you should make a blood test (hemogram), and a radiography  to find out the severity of the infection.I hope this helps you, and get good soon! :)"},{"Patient":"I am 18 years old. Three years ago i suffered from epididymitis, and as a result had to have my left testicle amputated. A few months later everything was healed, but i noticed a lump starting to grow on my right testicle. I went to a doctor and had an ultra-sound and he told me it was not cancerous and not to worry. For about 3 years i have had on and off minor pain in that testicle and the lump is still there. It is not growing, but it still concerns me. Is this a natural effect of testicular amputation or should I be worried?","Doctor":"Hello .Thank you for sharing your concern with us and for your trust.I would like to tell you that most of the testicular lumps are benign , noncancerous in nature and not serious at all  . And in few cases malignancy is seen as well .As your doctors ruled out any serious issue earlier with diagnostic tests so first of all there is nothing to worry much .  As you previously had epididymitis so there are possibility that this lump is epididymal cyst which does not require any treatment until and unless it's painful . Other possibilities includes conditions like hernia , varicocele , hydrocele which also can cause similar manifestations . If it's  causing discomfort in form of pain then I would suggest you to consult with your healthcare providers . Painful lumps which causes discomfort can easily be resected with a minor surgery if needed .Best Regards ,DR.S.TOMAR"},{"Patient":"I had this lymp nodes tuberculosis in my neck two years back, i was under medication for two months, actually it was for 6 months course. i found the lymps getting smaller so i didnt bother to take medicine later.. it was all good untill one day after the trip to manali i have noticed that same kind of lymps appearing in all over my neck, i started with a fever and nausea.. i had to test again, the report came out as kochs chest this time which is tuberculosis they said.. so i started the dose again, but my question is that my fever has been for almost two weeks and it still not going away. even after taking anti tb drugs..why would that be so? i dont have any cough or other symptoms except some pain in the muscle... please help","Doctor":"Hello,Thanks for using HCM. i had gone though the data you have posted.according to what you have said initially you had lymphnode tuberculosis you used treatment for 2 months and then discontinuednext time you told lymphnodes but u said kochs chestas you have defaulted the therapy once you need to be startedon 5 drugs for 2 months see the response then 4 drugs for 1 month and then 3 or 2 drus for 5 or 6 months.and there is a chance that you may be affected by secondary drug ressistant TB this time. so you need to do culture and sensitivity at the time of diagnosis itself as the reports take one month time. as you said there was not much improvement in your condition there are two possibilities for thathow many drug regimen you are on?are you having secondary drug resistant TB?do you have any secondary bacterial infection which may need antibiotics.so kindly consult your doctor and discuss the possibilities with him. hope this helps.."},{"Patient":"Hello Doctor.

I ve never had any problems. I am currently taking 30ml oxycodone and somas. I ve been taking these particular medications for a little over a year with no problems. But recently, I ve had heart pain for the past 11 days. From the second I wake up, until the moment I go to bed, my heart hurts bad. Its a sore/sharp pain. The pain has not gone away for even a minute for these past 11 days. Could this be caused by taking somas and the oxycodone s, or just by taking the somas alone? And if so, what could be the problem specifically? Or could this constant, consistant heart pain be caused by something else? If so, any ideas of what could be causing it? i take around 6 somas a day. And I take them for pain, not to get high. because of my tolerance, I barely feel anything anyways.

You should know that these drugs can lead to addiction and tolerance if taken for a long time (such as in your case). For this reason, I would recommend consulting with your attending physician and discussing about the possibility of switching to Pregabaline or Amitriptyline to help control chronic pain. It is also important to stop gradually some and Oxycodone. Another treatment option could be Duloxetine. You should discuss with your doctor on the above treatment options.

I understand your concern. Typhoid and paratyphoid fevers are commonly grouped together under the collective term 'enteric fever'. Typhoid is caused by Salmonella typhi and paratyphoid is caused by either Salmonella paratyphi A, B, or C. WIDAL test is a presumptive serological test for enteric fever. Widal Test is an agglutination test which detects the presence of serum agglutinins (H and O) in patients serum with typhoid and paratyphoid fever. If the titre shows 1:100 or more for O agglutinations and 1:200 or more for H agglutination, it should be considered as clinically significant and indicative of active infection. Hence, from the above report you have furnished, it is evident that he is suffering from typhoid. Typhoid fever is treated with a course of oral antibiotics which kill the Salmonella bacteria. Several antibiotics are effective for the treatment of typhoid fever. The choice of antibiotics is guided by identifying the geographic region where the infection was contracted. With appropriate antibiotic therapy, there is usually improvement within one to two days and recovery within seven to 10 days.

I recently shared a cabin with a stroke victim who claimed she could not sleep all night. What I noticed is that repeatedly in the middle of the night she would suddenly and violently wake up without cause and think I was making noise. She also the week before the trip underwent an invasive procedure endoscopicly to see if she needed a stint placed in her artery. Could she be reacting to that, too? She claimed she slept better once we were in a hotel on land and I got my own cabin. Others in my family report that I am a quiet sleeper, so I believe I am not the cause of her insomnia which has plagued her all her life. A very light sleeper, or is something more serious going on that her doctor needs to know about? Thanks for your answer in advance. Nina Daniel","Doctor":"Hello I understand your concern and would explain that the sleep disturbances in this case could be related to depression or anxiety,  probably caused by the stressful situation in which the patients has been through. You should know that stroke can trigger depression and anxiety,  as well as other medical procedures. Anyway you should also know that there are many treatment options in such cases.  It is important consulting with a neurologist and discussing about this. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further.

Take caution if you have history of stomach ulcers (it may cause bleeding) or allegey to advil. You should also not take the advil if you are dehydrated as this may injure you kidneys.

I rang the womens hospital in liverpool for advice and they told me to go to my GP for a blood test. I was 10 minutes late for the blood test and they refused to see me and said they had no more appointments for me even though I told them my circumstances. I went to a walk in surgery elsewhere and they said I was to take a week off work and go for a blood test at the end of next week to see if I have the virus. I have returned home and been told by someone else that I need a blood test now to see if I am imune from the virus. I am very confused and don't know what to do. I had a miscarriage last year due to catching mumps from a child in my class so am very worried.","Doctor":"Hi, I really appreciate our concern about this delicate situation. As you have been advised by your GP and Women's Hospital you would have to take the Blood test suggested to you as soon as possible. I would suggest you to make another appointment and get that blood work done as soon as possible.         As main aim of this blood test (IgG,IgM Titers against Parvovirus B19) is to evaluate if you had previous immunity against the disease. If you had immunity you will be fine but if you don't you will need to go under close obstetrical monitoring in following weeks including serial ultrasounds whil will keep an eye for any defects in your baby because of this infection.           I hope I have answered your question correctly. I know you might be worried too much, but I would like to tell you to keep calm and reschedule that Blood wokup appointment and get the results done.

Most probably there would have been no transmission or the dog may have not been infected, but to be 100% sure as there is no care for Rabies, I suggest that you take a full course of Anti-rabies Vaccine (ARV) and Tetanus shots which is free in any government facility if you are from India following the bite 72 hours or otherwise also. Also i suggest you to keep an eye on the dogs if they show any warning signs.           Also, take care while feeding street dogs because you can't be sure about their histories and you can't track them down to keep an eye on them. So better be careful i future.

Since the doctor has not mentioned number of tablets how many should I take in a day. My age is 37, sex - male.Thanks,Gaurav Sharma","Doctor":"Hi & Welcome.Tablet Forecox contains Isoniazid, Rifampicin, Ethambutal & Pyrizinamide whereas Tablet Macox contains Isoniazid & Rifampicin.These are the first line drugs used in the treatment of pulmonary tuberculosis.As per the Revised National Tuberculosis Control Program, DOTS (Directly Observed Treatment - Short course) is recommended for the treatment of tuberculosis wherein the drugs are taken only thrice a week instead of daily. This is cost effective, results in reduced side effects and improves patient's compliance (capacity to take the tablet regularly). As per the DOTS you should take the medicines as follows. 1. Two tablets of Forecox to be taken once daily, thrice a week for 2 months & followed by 2. One tablet of Macox to be taken once daily, thrice a week for 4 months. All the medications should be taken early morning before meals as this helps in proper absorption of the drugs.  Pyridoxine 10mg to prevent neuropathy (caused by Isoniazid) is added to this regime.You have been prescribed the correct treatment for TB. Since you have completed 2 months of treatment with tablet Forecox with Pyridoxine, now you need to take one tablet containing Isoniazid & Riframpicin (Macox) along with Pyridoxine for remaining 4 months.Hope this will help you in getting the proper treatment."},{"Patient":"I have been with my boyfriend for over 3 months.

This may be due to broken vessels around the prothesis, triggered by anticoagulant therapy given after this kind of surgeries and due to the motion of the hip.The hematoma is a ideal place for bacteria to grow , that's why your doctor has given antibiotics to you, just to prevent infection.The fact that the culture was negative , in most of the cases means that there is no infection, especially if you had no other symptoms  beside bleeding, such as fever, pain, difficulties in moving the hip and red, swollen, warm tissue around it.Eventhough, I support the prophylactic treatment with antibiotics given to you at the hospital.Hope this is helpful.Let me know if you need more clarifications.

About 16 weeks after that I started to have pain in my underarms and in my groin area. Also had night sweats and was very fatigued for about 2-3 weeks.

A few months later I started to get brownish red spots in my mouth that would come and go, and sores in the inside of my noise. Also I started to have chronic sinusitis (I still have that now). Only thing that clears it up for a while is nasal spray, very hot or cold air, when I take long walks, or if I have some kind of mint gum or candy but it only lasts for a while. A year later I started to get canker sores in my mouth and the brownish red ones every once and a while too. I had never had a canker sore in my life.

I am not sure, what to do. I have still not consulted any dermatologist. I have also applied a corn cap and the skin has become yellowish.

First of all thank you for sharing your concern with us and showing trust on us.As it has recurred 2 times already so I would advise you to get it checked with podiatrist . Corns of feet wouldn't get better unless the cause of pressure is eliminated . The underlying issues should be treated in order to get rid off such corn issues .At home you can follow these:1. wash your feet well , make them dry and apply foot moisturizers daily.2.wear comfortable shoes .3.use foot filer to gently remove the hard skin regularly.Recurrent corns which is a chronic problem shows the possibility of some structural abnormality in foot structure which should be checked with podiatrist . Don't try to remove or puncture it at home as it can lead to bacterial infection . Consult foot expert ( podiatrist) straight away.This is my initial response and discussion is open until you have any query or need further clarification.I wish you good health .Thank you for your question and feel free to contact further for any question .sincerely,Dr. Shardendu Tomar"},{"Patient":"okay for the past month i have been really sick.

Thus, I suggest that you rewrite your question again and include more details so that we can help you better. You should tell us about your age? if you take any medication? is your vomiting intermittent? how many time do you have vomiting per week or month? do you have any abdominal pain? what's the consistency of your vomit? do you have any history of any other diseases? do you have diarrhea? you can also add more information that you think is important for us to know.However if i base my answer to your question and that all your blood test showed normal (i'm assuming by these blood tests the doctors has ruled out underlying cause of your vomiting), then I suspect  you might be having intolerance to certain types of food, such as Gluten intolerance also known as celiac disease, milk protein or lactose intolerance.My advice is that you visit a doctor and request to do the following tests1.IgA TTG test 2.Lactose tolerance test3.Milk allergy test.along with these tests make sure you tell the Doctors your full detailed history so they can reach to an appropriate diagnosis.If you have more questions don't hesitate to ask.Hope this helped."},{"Patient":"Presently i have problem of Little heaviness in my heart.i can feel everypulse in my heart which make dizziness and less concentration in my work.

By the way i am a woman and i was infected with Rubella virus last November 17, 2015, i suffered severe pains in my almost my whole body but until now i still have the symptoms-pains of muscles, bones, and joints. What do you think i am suffering now? Am i suffering the complications of rubella virus or i have other illnesses that made my ESR high. Thanks again.","Doctor":"Hi dear, Thanks for choosing Healthcare magic.High ESR is not specific test to any disease, it occurs due to an underlying inflammation, that can be in anywhere in the body due to many factors such as infection (cold infection, tuberculosis or any kind of infection), arthritis, thyroid dysfunctions, tumors and the list continues. Therefore, when doctors see high ESR they consider running other tests to find out the underlying condition.I highly doubt your symptoms are related to your previous Rubella infection, rubella infection subsides with in 14 days, there are some women who reported joint pains that continued for almost a month, its unusual to see the symptoms of joint pain or body ache continue more than that.Follow my advice below.1.Do you have any kind of infections at the moment? for example sore throat, pharyngitis, flu? etc. if so then your high ESR level would be just because of that, so wait for at least a month and redo blood test to check ESR level, if it's still high while you are not experiencing in infection symptoms then visit Doctor to do more tests.2.If you currently have no any sign of infection such as above mentioned then visit a doctor now, so that they can run appropriate tests to check for any underlying diseases.I hope this helped.If you have more questions don't hesitate to ask.Wish you all the best"},{"Patient":"Hi, may I answer your health queries right now ?

I suspect your daughter has Ringworm, it’s common mild fungal infection and it usually presents as you have stated in your question. It could also be Tenia versicolar infection which again is a fungal infection. both of them are treated with an over the counter anti fungal creams.Since you mentioned that your daughter is now perfectly fine and she has no other symptoms other than these circles then i highly doubt it's related to her previous infection. I suggest that you get an anti fungal cream such as clotrimazole and apply it around the affected areas twice a day for at least 2 weeks. Important note: Skin conditions are not easy to be diagnosed online without full inspection, you could also consider sending a picture of the effected area here on healthcaremagic. Some skin diseases mimic each other and only by running some tests a Doctor can identify the cause and thus give proper treatment.

I was examined for a collection of 3 red bumps outside of my vaginal opening ...after a 5 second look at it the Dr said it was herpes and proceeded to prescribe me meds... my culture results have not yet come in...what are other possibilities and what advice do u have on herbal cures?","Doctor":"Hi, Thanks for posting in HCM. I understand your concern. Genital herpes is one of the most common sexually transmitted diseases. Most cases of genital herpes are caused by infection by the herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2). You may wait for the culture results to add any other medication, if necessary. You need to take the prescribed medications by your doctor. However, here is no cure for genital herpes. But the symptoms can be lessened and prevented with treatment. Treatment can also reduce the risk of infecting others. Treatment recommended would be with antiviral medications, which will help to prevent or reduce the pain and discomfort from an outbreak of symptoms. Medication taken on a daily basis to suppress the virus can reduce the number of outbreaks and reduce the risk of infecting others. You may try home remedies by using Aloe Vera Gel, Bathing with Epsom salt water, Natural oils and ice pack to soothen the skin and reduce the pain associated with it. Hope the information provided would be helpful.

I have been to seven doctors with no avail. If it’s not in their medical book it doesn’t exist attitude. We make that eight a veterinarian was probably the smartest of them all. Or else his book is larger. With a own my own business auto electric.~They build high-performance starters alternators and generators the building that I’m in is 60 years old. It is overrun by pigeons they covered the rooftops. I have been in the building for 18 years. 4 ½ years ago my house went into foreclosure and I moved into my business that’s when my problems started. After living there for two weeks, I would wake up in the middle of the night feeling something was bitting me, but when I turned on the lights I couldn’t see any thing they must have been so small I could see them with the naked eye. I’ve been treated for scabies six times that did not work changing and everything that goes along with cleaning the Betting keeping my clean clothes in plastic bags and my use in plastic bags. Two other tenants also contracted the same disease or virus or whatever it is. They also tried Dr. after Dr. with no avail. Every year I get a physical the laboratory on my urine test came back with parasites or shall I say bug in my urine. Finally without even trying I thought maybe now they would listen. No my doctor said you’ve probably had something on your hand when you did your urine test and it fell into the urine bottle off your hands. We are back to square one again. I am no longer in that building but I still have these bugs every 7 to 10 days new eggs hatch and IAM overrun by them. Dermatologists do they even have to take a test to be one. The veterinarian knows more than they do. They all tell me I in psychosomatic. If five or peroxide on my arms it looks like alien lives inside my arms they actually contract and move from side to side in anybody’s looking at my our is in all its and the doctors. But it’s not in their books so it doesn’t exist on it’s a figment of their imagination even though they can explain this phenomenon and see it with their own  two eyes. It can see them under the skin they are like chameleons they change colors to what ever the background is if I tried to pump them like a pimple which I have done they feel like a piece of sand. One middle strand of hair comes out of the skin if I pulled my hair it breaks off but grows instantly back out. I’ve done this for 15 to 20 min. and as fast as you can pull it out it grows back instantly I have shaved my chest completely cleaned of hair by the time I wake up in the morning it is close to a half inch long and it looks identical to my chest hair. When it is pulled out there is no pain like there would be if it was your own hair it just goes right back instantly that you can see with the naked eye. I showed to the doctors they don’t want to see it. It’s like they’re in denial I don’t understand. I don’t even tell the doctors what I think is because of fear they will make fun of me. One Dr. asked me what I thought it was I told him I thought it was bird mites he started laughing than he said he you mean tweet tweet, then he said let me hear you Tweet Tweet the national anthem. This was two years into trying to get rid of these things, I completely lost it I don’t need to go into that part of Police Department showed up and after quieting me down determined that this Dr. had no protocol and probably shouldn’t you be practicing medicine. But that is all beside the point I still have these bugs and have tried everything you can imagine saying in the for two hours with bleach, one doctor told me take me tenderizer and a skeptic pencil meld them together in water and rubbed them on your body. I’m confirmed believer that these things cannot be fixed externally peer must be something that you can take internally to get rid of them. Simple green I take showers with back biodegradable when I put it on my skin it gets red hot. It definitely slows them down. Glycerin they hate moisturizers. Eucalyptus works very good also but does not kill the eggs.

I feel  a little helpless I cant help her and feel the need to protect myself as well being her mother. Thank you for listening, hope you can help with this. Kind regards Tina","Doctor":"Dear Tina Ma'am, Hi & Welcome to HCM.Yes shingles can be transmitted from a person with active shingles to another person who has never had chickenpox.Shingles, also known as herpes zoster, is an infection of a nerve and the skin around it. It is caused by the varicella-zoster virus which also causes chickenpox.The main symptom is a painful rash which develops on one side of the face or body. The rash forms blisters that contain the active virus. The blisters typically scab over in 7-10 days &  clear up within 2-4 weeks.The person with active shingles can transmit the virus until the rash has developed crusts (scab).The virus that causes shingles can spread from a person with active shingles to another person who has never had chickenpox.  Once infected, the person will develop chickenpox, however but not shingles. So, I would advise your daughter to avoid contact with her friend till the rash has developed crusts. I also recommend Shingles vaccine for both of you as it reduces the risk of developing shingles and the long-term pain from post-herpetic neuralgia (PHN) caused shingles.Hope the suggestion given would be beneficial to both of you."},{"Patient":"Hello Dr. from past 3-4 days was having severe headache,body pain,cough&cold & minor fever. i thought it was due to cough & cold so i took D COLD TOTAL but without seeing chance of recovery i took Calpol & Disprine without consulting Dr but my body is still in fever from inside ......... my mom says i may have chance of having Malaria because fever is not going down... will you suggest me what to do?","Doctor":"Hello And thanks for sharing your concern with us.High fever , shaking chills and sweating are hallmark feature of malaria and your present complaints are not suggestive of malaria .

If soap is not available, flush with water alone. Then the wound should be cleaned thoroughly with 70% Alcohol or Povidone solution.Avoid covering the wound with paper stitches or dressings. Suturing facilitates further inoculation of rabies virus.If necessary suturing should be done by the doctor after infiltration of wound with rabies immunoglobulin (RIG). The sutures should be loose & should not interfere with free bleeding and drainage. The secondary suture of bite wounds results in better cosmetic outcomes.If your puppy is vaccinated and the vaccination certificate is valid, then there's no need to take the anti-rabies vaccine. Otherwise you will have to take 5 doses of anti-rabies vaccine on days 0,3,7,14 & 30. Observe your puppy for 10 days following the bite and if the puppy is found to be healthy then you may discontinue the remaining doses of vaccine on day 14 and 30.And make sure that your puppy is vaccinated.Take care."},{"Patient":"hi..i got a dog bite..after 8 days..i go to hospital to get a vaccinebut the nurses the worries me because she told me the vaccine should inject within 3days after the dog bite..how ever they still inject me a vacine first shot yesterday feb.26 and the other shot in the following day..should i be worried about the nurses told me?","Doctor":"Hi & Welcome.Taking anti-rabies vaccine 8 days after the dog bite will not cause any serious health issues.Ideally, the first dose of anti-rabies vaccine should be taken as soon as possible after exposure; failing that, it should be given without further delay as in your case.If the dog is a stray dog, take 4 doses of anti-rabies vaccine as per the dosage schedule on days 0 (1st dose), 3 ,7 & 14.Since the incubation period of rabies virus (in humans) ranges from 2 weeks to 6 months.

What are the chances I could have contracted Hep-C from this tattoo? also I recently got the tattoo when should I get tested if I had any concerns?","Doctor":"Hi, Thanks for posting in HCM. I understand your concern. Hepatitis C virus is transmitted only by blood. Unlike many other blood borne viruses (like HIV), virtually any source of blood or blood products seems to be capable of carrying the virus, even if the source is indirect, like for example - a used razor. This makes hepatitis C far more transmissible than most other blood borne viruses. Hepatitis C virus is most frequently transmitted through large or repeated direct percutaneous exposures to infected blood. Hence, there is a high possibility of contacting infection with Hepatitis C virus by means of getting tattoo as it involves repeated skin pricks. Hope the information provided would be helpful.

The cyst was apparent to me after a work shift when I laid down and felt a terrible pain, and found the bump.  I have done research and think it is possible that this pilonidal cyst occurred from rupture on the inside.  Is this possible from the heavy lifting?","Doctor":"Hi, Thanks for posting in HCM. I have read your description and understand your concern. Pilonidal cyst occurs at the bottom of the tailbone (coccyx) and can become infected and filled with pus. It causes swelling, redness and burning sensation when it becomes infected. Activities that cause friction, like sitting, can force the hair growing in the area to burrow back under the skin. Body considers it to be foreign material and the immune response forms the cyst around your hair.A doctor can diagnose a pilonidal cyst by taking a history and performing a physical exam. It can be managed conservatively when it is diagnosed early on, wherein, if you aren’t experiencing severe pain and there’s no sign of inflammation. It is likely that your doctor will prescribe a broad-spectrum antibiotic and ask you to pay particular attention to hygiene. If you have a recurring symptoms or if you have more than one sinus tract, your doctor will recommend a surgical procedure. In this, the surgeon will open the lesions, removing all of the pus and debris. Subsequent follow-up would be necessary. Kindly consult Surgeon in this regard for proper assessment and management.

I understand your concern. Foot and mouth disease is a highly contagious infection, caused by viruses from the Enterovirus family, most commonly the 'coxsackie virus'. It is characterized by blisters or sores in the mouth and a rash on the hands and feet. In most cases, the infection will go away without treatment by 7 to 10 days. However, taking the following would  help to ease symptoms until the disease has run its course. These can include:1. Over-the-counter topical ointments to soothe blisters and rashes.2. Analgesic medication, such as acetaminophen or ibuprofen, to relieve headaches.3. Medicated syrups or lozenges to ease painful sore throats. 4. Swishing warm salt water around in the mouth helps relieve the pain associated with mouth blisters and throat sores. 5. Avoid cold beverages, citrus fruits, fruit drinks, spicy or salty foods.

The smell of fish came back right after I was finishing my period- is this from my period or has Chlamydia come back from my previous boyfriend or do I have a new infection from this partner?","Doctor":"Hello,I can understand your concern. Fishy vaginal smell is most commonly due to bacterial vaginosis, a bacterial infection of the vagina. It may be triggered by having sexual intercourse with a new partner so that fits your description too. The other possibility is Trichomoniasis. Though it is Sexually transmitted Disease, it is very easily cured. Good thing is, either bacterial vaginosis or Trichomoniasis, the treatment stays same.I would advise you to take Levofloxacin 250 mg (Levoflox) twice a day for five days. The smell should disappear by the time the course is completed.If it does not improve in five days, a gynecologist should be consulted for physical examination and vaginal swab analysis.I hope this information helps.

As lymph nodes are surrounded by nerves and blood vessels everywhere around them, increase in their size due to swelling can surely compress the nerve and/or blood vessels causing pain and other neurological symptoms.I think this is the time you should see your treating doctor or neurologist and discuss the situation as if the swelling is increasing, it can cause further complications.I hope this information helps.

This is followed by administration of 2 antibiotics like Isoniazide & Rifampicin ONCE daily for remaining 4 months (continuation phase). There after you will be rechecked again by certain lab tests such as Sputum for AFB, ESR, Chest Xray, etc to check the response to the treatment.Along with medications you need to take a high protein diet, increase the intake of fruits and vegetables and Vitamin B6 (Pyridoxine) to prevent the side effect of inflamed nerves caused by Isoniazide.Your fasting blood glucose level is high, so you also need to take medications like Metformin with or without Sulfonylurea like Glimepride to control the high blood glucose after consulting a physician.Hope the suggestions given above would be useful."},{"Patient":"sir , my pet dog bite me on 12th january 2014 so i took the vaccine 0,3, 7 th day after vaccination ie from bite- 0, 4th ,11th day. it was over by january 22-2014. but again my dog bit me on march 2nd-2014. do i need vaccination. if so, how many days and in what intervel.","Doctor":"Hi & Welcome.If your pet dog's vaccination certificate is not valid then you need to take two booster doses of anti rabies vaccines on day 0 & 3 irrespective of the interval from previous complete vaccination.Don't forget to vaccinate your pet dog against rabies annually and keep its vaccination certificate valid.Hope this solves your problem."},{"Patient":"Hi, I have what I think to be an infected wound on my leg.

It is also very painful and is starting to affect my walking. I have a history of MRSA and oral antibiotics don't seem to work for me. What is it and what should I do?","Doctor":"Hi & Welcome to HCM.I can understand your concern, you seem to have developed  MRSA infection following 'nicking' which is not responding to routinely used antibiotics.You need to send the pus for culture and sensitivity tests. Based on the result the most appropriate (sensitive to to MRSA) should be taken preferably by IM OR IV injection. The most preferred antibiotics to treat the difficult to treat MRSA includes Vancomycin, Daptomycin, Linezolid, Tigecycline, or Ceftaroline.You also need to take non steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (like Ibuprofen) to reduce the painful swelling associated with the infection.Further, you need to be examined by a GP for proper evaluation and the treatment as suggested above.Best regards."},{"Patient":"Can you get rabies from petting an animal who may be suspected to have rabies or from kissing them on the back of the head?

Licks to wounds or grazed and broken skin, or to the lining of the mouth and nose, can also transmit the disease.The virus is UNLIKELY to spread by touching or feeding the pet animals or kissing them on the back of their heads or by the licks with saliva on intact skin or by contact of intact skin with secretions  or excretions of such animals.Please see that your pet animal is properly vaccinated against rabies and the efficacy of the vaccine is confirmed by the lab evidence.Hope I could answer your query."},{"Patient":"iam suffering from typhoid fever since 1year get hospitalised 3 times in a year & treatred with antibiotics & monocef injection,but still i feel burning sensation in my whole body sometime chills also but when i check temp it show normal i also feel weakness while walking or doing  little work.pls help to whom i shuld consult best doc.in delhi","Doctor":"Hi thanks for contacting HCM......Noted you are suffering from recurrent typhoid fever...Here your typhoid bacilli eradication might not be complete...You can consult gastroenterologist for proper evaluation...Sometime typhoid bacilli can survive in gall bladder and not fully eradicated.Typhoid also affect muscles so weakness felt...As typhoid is infection by inflammatory mediators fever can occur...If needed here stool and blood culture needed before giving antibiotic and according to sensitivity give drug...If needed intravenous antibiotic needed...After recovery take soft and bland diet.For few days semisolid diet and fruit juice taken more ....Avoid outside food like junk foods and meats....If still bacteria not eradicated (after 3 stool culture) then cholecystectomy sometime might needed.According to me yes consult gastroenterologist with keeping my answer in mind.Take care.DR.PARTH"},{"Patient":"Hi Dr. my name is Sue,I was diagnised with H.

Genital warts are the most common viral sexually transmitted infection (STI). They are caused by the human papilloma virus (HPV) which can be passed on during sexual contact. Most of the visible genital warts often go away with time, but, the virus cannot be cured once it is in your bloodstream. This means that you may have several outbreaks over the course of your life. Treatment of genital warts is indicated to relieve painful symptoms or to minimize their appearance. Any of the topical wart treatments like imiquimod or trichloroacetic acid or podophyllin and podofilox can be used. If visible warts do not go away with time, you may require surgery to remove them by means of burn (electrocautery), freeze (cryosurgery), laser, or excision.

The doctor's keep telling me it's viral they have given her a puffer and antibiotics, but blocked nose has never left her and it's been 5 MONTHS! please help.","Doctor":"Hi dear, Sleep apnea doesn't go away with nasal sprays, humidifiers or antibiotics, children with sleep apnea might get cold more than others, perhaps that's why doctors suggested giving her puffer or nasal spray just to reduce cold symptoms.Sleep apnea is more of an underlying condition by which muscles at the back of the throat tend to relax making it difficult for the air to pass in and out of the lungs, children with this condition have loud snoring while asleep, sometimes breathing is disturbed (or you can hear like a chocking sound while sleeping). The first line of treatment sleep apnea is surgery by removing tonsils and adenoids to ease airway passage. The best thing i would suggest to do now, is to go to an ENT specialist to evaluate your daughters situation and severity of her condition, the ENT will then decide if she needs surgery or not according to her situation. Since she is just 4 years old and from the way i read your question i believe her situation is mild and perhaps she doesn't need surgery now.Wish you and your daughter all the best."},{"Patient":"I was sick for a few days this past week, and was bedridden for three.

Assuming that your dog is not vaccinated against rabies, you need to take a single tetaus shot and 5 doses of anti rabies vaccine on the days 0,3,7,14 and 28 following dog bite. If your dog remains healthy and does not show any abnormal behavior for 10 days post bite, you can discontinue the anti rabies vaccine doses on day 14 and 28.Beside, you need to take a course of appropriate antibiotic (like Cloxacillin) and anti inflammatory drugs (like Ibuprofen) for the treatment of the infection after consulting a GP. Do not forget to vaccinate your dog every year and always keep the vaccinated certificate valid.Hope this answers your query."},{"Patient":"i had a mi 3 yrs ago .STEMI, arrested ,cardioverted and 2 Cypher Sents.. got strep last week and was admitted to hospital for 3 days. 1st troponin was \\"normal\\" 2nd was 0.10, 3rd 0.11 4th 0.09. NO other cardiac symptoms. Could the slightly elevated troponin be due to strep infection and/or the existing damage from the prior MI? I am Male 67 with controlled hypertension go to gym 5 days a week for the past 3 yrs.","Doctor":"Hi & Welcome to HCM.Streptococcal infection is unlikely to cause elevated Troponin levels.A troponin test measures the levels Troponin T or troponin I proteins in the blood. These proteins are elevated when the heart muscle has been damaged, such as occurs with a heart attack.Most patients who have had a heart attack have elevated Troponin levels within 6 hours and which may remain high for 1 to 2 weeks after a heart attack.Since you do not have symptoms suggestive of heart problem and the BP also seems to be controlled the elevated levels of Troponin could be due prolonged exercise during gym. However, it is better to get an ECG done to be on safer side to rule out the ischemic heart disease.Hope this answers your query."},{"Patient":"Good Evening Doctor i am suffering from toe fungal infection. can you please tell me something about its treatment and how much time it will take to get cure. i am also taking a medicine named terbifine since 19 jan 2010. but there is no improvement can you please suggest something. Thanks in advance!","Doctor":"Good evening & Welcome to HCM.Incomplete data like age, gender, any associated medical problem like diabetes, duration of anti-fungal (Terbinafine) treatment??To be effective, Terbinafine should be taken for 6 to 12 weeks. The result of  successful treatment will be seen until the nail grows back completely. It may take 4 months or longer to eliminate an infection.If you did not notice any response even after 4 months, it may be due to ineffective treatment or resistance to Terbinafine. In that case other medications like Itraconazole tablet or anti-fungal nail polish containing Ciclopirox would be more effective.Besides, your nail should be trimmed properly this helps reduce pain by reducing pressure and the drug can reach deeper layers of the nail.Any underlying cause like diabetes should be controlled with the medications.Hope the suggestions given would be useful."},{"Patient":"I have been smoking weed fairly regularly over the past year and have also recently been diagnosed with ADD and currently take 36mg Concerta XL (methylphenidate hydrochloride) daily. I ve been told that smoking while on concerta can be very bad for me. As far as my research has taken me, many people say that from experience the two do not interact in any significant way, and as far as I know I can say the same. However, the doctor that prescribed the medicine said that the combination can make me depressed and demotivated, and give me more intense mood swings. Also, apparently concerta increases your heart rate, which I haven t really noticed until recently where I ve taken a break from smoking weed (only a week and a half so far). I skateboard every day and I ve always had an issue with sweating a lot very easily to the point where I ll look like I just came out the shower after 20 minutes of solid skating, but now my heart rate shoots up massively as well, which didn t seem to happen when I was smoking and taking the medication (even though I usually skate sober). So I m wondering if there s any information I m missing out on or if continuing to smoke weed while on concerta will be very detrimental to my health... I m aware this is a long question but I d very much like to know as much as I can because I enjoy weed immensely, but I also think the concerta benefits me a lot in many ways. Thanks for your time, a comprehensive answer would be hugely appreciated. :)","Doctor":"Hi, I suggest you avoid smoking weed while on Concerta. Continue to take the medications given by your treating doctor strictly according to the prescription. Forcibly smoking weed will cause interactions with Concerta causing ill effects to show later in life. Profuse sweating and heart rate shooting up (palpitations) are indications that you have coronary artery disease developing. Get done lipid profile and  ECG, echocardiography and stress test if needed along with MRI and CT to rule out coronary artery disease. In the meantime take boiled homemade food, stay away from stress, tension, anxiety and take adequate sleep. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further.

The lower right back pain could be unrelated to the fever you have, it could be due some activities you did that caused you the pain. However you should remember that fever with back pain could indicate that there is infection in your back or kidneys and must be seen and evaluated by a doctor. Unfortunately in your question you haven't included how long you had this condition so i cant reach to a better conclusion. Therefore read below for my suggestion.If you had fever and back pain for 5 days or more with no any betterment of the symptoms then visit Doctor immediately. If you got fever and back pain about a day or two days ago then start taking Paracetamol 500mg 4 times a day and continue for 3 days, if your fever and pain doesn't reduce with taking paracetamol or you still have fever after 3 days of taking the medicine then visit a Doctor.

I understand your concern. Widal test is used as diagnostic test to detect typhoid. It can gives false positive reactions. The rising titre indicates disease rather than single positive test. Hence, after recovery from typhoid, some patients will have life long positivity to Widal test but they are free of disease. For this a repeat test is done after a week and if it shows rising titre, then it would be significant and not a single test result.

I have catastrophic insurance only and I am unemployed, thus going to the ER would send me to the poor house.","Doctor":"Hi there,Causes of heart palpitations are Hyperthyroidism, Anxiety, Stress, Anemia, Heart Diseases to name a few. Dog bites can cause rabies infection, but this is rarity these days because of immunization but still cannot be ruled out. If the dog was behaving in a strange way it could have carried a rabies virus. Still I do not think your palpitation are due to rabies as its incubation period(time since infection to the symptoms) is 1 to 2 months.

Your Palpitations could be from other reasons as indicated above.Thanks"},{"Patient":"Hello Doctor, My name is Dave,  i m 25 years old, my height is 5.5 FT, my body weight is 29 KG only,and I m from India.

To diagnose a tapeworm infection, the following needs to be done:1. Stool sample analysis by microscopic identification for eggs or tapeworm segments. It may require 2 to 3 stool analysis done regularly to look for the tapeworm infestation. 2. Blood test to detect antibodies your body may have produced to fight tapeworm infection. 3.

Other causes behind recurrent UTIs in young children includes urinary tract anatomical anomalies causing vesicoureteral reflux , immune system problems . I would insist you to encourage and teach your child to empty bladder as soon as she has to urge to go , it will help a lot in preventing such recurrent infections . As far as ear infections are concerned so its not related with UTIs and needs proper treatment after inspection with ENT specialist .If vesicoureteral reflux is causing such infections then small dose antibiotics could control such recurrent infections .I would suggest you to consult this issue further with pediatric urologist and ENT specialist as well . This is my initial response and discussion is open untill you have any query or need further clarification.I wish you good health .Thank you for your question and feel free to contact further for any question .sincerely,Dr. Shardendu Tomar"},{"Patient":"My boyfriend was diagnosed with ocular toxoplasmosis about 4 weeks ago and has been on a combination of aggressive treatment - antibiotics, steroids and eye drops. His eye sight is improving slowly and now his eye sight is good, if a little cloudy in one eye. He is still on treatment, but has been getting headaches over the last few days and is worried that he might have cerebral toxoplasmosis, even though he is immunocompetent. We would like to know if this is likely as we are not seeing a doctor for another week and he is extremely concerned.","Doctor":"Dear  , This is Dr. S. Tomar from healthcaremagic.com's medical team and I ll be your medical advisor for this question. First of all thank you for sharing your concern with us and showing trust on us.Occular toxoplasmosis is selflimiting condition in most of the cases and resolves on its own , but if infection is involving macular region and /or optic disc in immunocompromised patients then treatment is indicated with antibiotics like clindamycin or  azithromycin or pyrimethamine and steroid. Cerebral Toxoplasmosis is a common finding in immunocompromised patients and manifests in form of headaches because the abscesses are formed in brain tissues . Confusion , language disorders , seizures also are seen in cerebral toxoplasmosis . I would recommend you to consult this issue further with your health care providers and get MRI/CT scan done asap to rule out such possibility .This is my initial response and discussion is open untill you have any query or need further clarification.I wish you good health .Thank you for your question and feel free to contact further for any question .sincerely,Dr. Shardendu Tomar"},{"Patient":"hi i am 24 year old and i am suffering with itching around the anus no blood and pain but itching i was consult my doctor he told me there is no fissure or no piles and give me lidocaine 5% oniment it was useful but after some time  problem rise again and when i used cream like betnovate-c  it is useful for some time but after few days when i stopped use it problem comes again suggest me some cream or medicine i also take terbonfine tablet but not useful still suffering this problem","Doctor":"Hi thanks for posting on hcm.

I also have had severe dysplasia that has required a leep and laser about 3 years ago.  Can the c diff affect the dysplasia in any way to make it reoccur?","Doctor":"Hi & Welcome to HCM.Recurrent dysplasia is not associated with Clostridium difficile infection.Clostridium difficile infection occurs after the normal gut flora has been altered by antibiotic therapy. It is one of the most common caused of antibiotic associated opportunistic infection resulting in severe bloody diarrhea, abdominal cramps, dehydration, etc. The recurrent infection which sometimes occurs in about 30-40% of cases following a course of antibiotics (such as Metronidazole and Vancomycin) does not cause dysplasia of the colon. Recurrent colonic dysplasia could be a pre-cancerous condition which needs to be investigated by doing a biopsy.Hope I could answer your query."},{"Patient":"Hi there, my daughter came home from camp 5 days ago with a nasty stomach bug, two days later she is fine but now my wife is I'll.

It requires treatment with antibiotics.If your wife is not allergic to fluoroquinolones group of medicines, I suggest she should start with Norfloxacin 400 mg twice a day for five days. She can take ibuprofen 400 mg or Acetaminophen 500 mg for symptomatic relief from fever. As the infection will resolve, the fever and malaise will disappear.She should stay light on diet for a few days and avoid outside or junk food. Drinking lots of fluids will keep her hydrated and prevent from dehydration due to loss of water in diarrhoea. WHO ORS is also good alternative for keeping her hydrated.If she does not feel better in 3-5 days, physical examination by a physician and blood tests are advised.I hope this information helps.

Use vaginal pH balancing solutions like v-wash regularly. 3. Take a course of oral antibiotics containing Amoxacillin & Clavulenic acid. 4.

They did CT scan and found out that on top of appendix problems I had an infection in abdominal and or intestines.  They said it would not be wise to open up my body to remove the appendix until they got rid of my abdominal infection.  They gave me Metro and Cipro, went back to ER around the time the first cycle of antibiotics was finishing because I was having appendix pain.  They x rayed me and it looked like I was backed up in my stool and that’s what was causing appendix pain.  They gave me another round of Metro and Cipro, I had been having high heart rate, fatigue, shortness of breath, diarrhea, cramps.  I was starting to feel good and these symptoms were decreasing but went out on New Years and the next day started feeling the fatigue, shortness of breath, some subtle but sharp pain in abs, subtle cramps again but stool seemed to still be solid. Meanwhile I still have low level pain in appendix. I’m wondering if the diarrhea might be coming back soon.  But now my Metro cycle is done and Cipro cycle is almost done and I’m still having shortness of breath, fatigue and some cramps but the cramps aren’t as bad as they used to be.  I went in for my check up this week and they scheduled me for next month of removal of the appendix, but I forgot to tell them about my shortness of breath and fatigue because when I went in I was feeling good. My question is, since I’m still feeling fatigue, shortness of breath, and some cramps…should I go back into the ER? Should I ask for more antibiotics? Do you think there is a chance that my stomach infection got into my blood stream and that’s why I’m having fatigue and shortness of breath? If so, should I get more antibiotics?","Doctor":"Hi,Welcome to HCM.I have gone through your detailed query and I understand your concern regarding symptoms after antibiotics intake.I am suspecting the shortness of breath and fatigue could be side effects of prolonged use of broad spectrum antibiotics like ciprofloxacin and metronidazole.I suggest you relax and do not over exert during this period before you go for your appendix removal.If the shortness of breath and fatigue still remains even after complete bed rest then you need to get in touch with your treating physician for an opinion.It is less likely that your infection has spread and I do not think any new antibiotic is required.Wishing you good healthThanks."},{"Patient":"I am suffering form cough.

Diet needs a close attention while treating typhoid fever as it may relapse, if not taken care of. Generally during fever, a bland diet, which is smooth and soothing, is preferred. Care should be taken while cooking food and also choosing foods that are easy to digest. A progressive diet from a liquid diet to a normal diet depending on the level of tolerance would help the person’s appetite.Fluids in the form of tender coconut water, barley water, electrolyte fortified water, fresh fruit juice, vegetable soup, buttermilk and water can be given. Begin with semi-solid diet for a few days and then gradually include fruits like bananas, watermelons, grapes, peaches, and mango. It is better to avoid solid food until the appetite comes back to normal.As the appetite gets better, semi-solid to solid foods can be given. Boiled rice, baked potato, baked apple, yoghurt, vegetable soup can be given.Gradually, by 3 to 4 weeks, normal diet can be restored.Foods to be avoided:1. High fiber foods like whole grain cereals and their products like oatmeal, whole wheat bread and raw vegetables in the form of salads2. Vegetables like cabbage, capsicum and turnip as these can cause bloating and gas.3. Oily foods, spices and seasoning like pepper, cayenne and chilli powder to prevent aggravation of inflammation of digestive tract. Hope the information provided would be helpful.

Took home remedies and 3 tabs of Dependal. Gave it a days break and took Norflox TZ. Got much better after 6tabs in 3days. Should I continue for 5 days of 10 tabs?","Doctor":"HiThank you for asking HCMI have gone through your query. Dependal and Norflox Tz are antibiotics which can cause serious side effects like clostridium difficile colitis when used not judiciously. So avoid it with out written doctors advise. As you taken three days further continuation won't be needed. Take probiotics. You can take yogurt , kefir or bifidobacterium preparations for this. Taking banana is also good. Applying warm water bags on abdomen is helpful also. In case of diarrhoea take fluids and electrolytes like ORS or tender coconut water etc. If it continues do a stool routine examination and consult your doctor.Hope this may help you. Let me know if anything not clear.Thanks."},{"Patient":"hi doctor my mother inlow has been suffering from leprosy from last 1 year,all body has infected now,treatment has going well but I am worried about family members who are being with her in same house,my kids are age 8 and 13,should we keep away kids from her,and what should we take precaution for our self,kindly suggest-thankyou","Doctor":"Hi, Thanks for posting in HCM. I understand your concern. Leprosy, also known as Hansen's disease (HD), is a long term infection caused by the bacteria Mycobacterium leprae and Mycobacterium lepromatosis. The exact mechanism of transmission of leprosy is not known. It is known to spread from person to person by nasal secretions or droplets. However, the disease is not highly contagious like the flu. There are also other possibilities such as transmission through insects which cannot be completely ruled out. Some researchers now conclude that susceptibility to leprosy may be partially inheritable.Initially, infections are without symptoms and typically remain this way from 5 to as long as 20 years. Hence, it would be better to take precautions to avoid contacting with the organism by: 1. Wearing a mask to cover mouth and nasal cavity when near the patient. 2. Washing hands frequently and use hand sanitizer to disinfect the fomites. 3. Gargle with warm salt water thrice a day. Hope the information provided would be helpful. All the best."},{"Patient":"Hello.....my six yr old daughter was diagnosed with strep throat today and was running a fever earlier this afternoon.  Since I have been with her thru this, am I now contagious.  I am concerned about returning to work tomorrow and getting others sick.   Is that possible?","Doctor":"Hi, Thanks for posting in HCM. I understand your concern. Streptococcal infection of respiratory tract is air-borne and hence is transmissible. In case your immunity is good, probably you could fight the organism without getting infected. However, it would be better to take precautions to avoid flaring up of symptoms. 1. Kindly wear a mask when you are near your daughter. 2. Wash your hands frequently and use hand sanitizer to disinfect the fomites. 3. Gargle with warm salt water 3 to 4 times a day. Hope the information provided would be helpful. All the best."},{"Patient":"This may be a stupid question, but the other day, I came home to berries splattered across my front door and all over my door mat - it was obviously dropped by some kind of animal (since the berries were from a tree nearby). I was unaware of this until I had already stepped on them while walking outside. Some of the berry matter got on my foot. Since it was most likely dropped from an animal, am I now at a risk for getting rabies?","Doctor":"Hi, Thanks for posting in HCM. I have read your description and understand your concern. Stepping on berries eaten by animals would not cause rabies. Rabies virus spread when an infected animal scratches or bites human. Saliva from an infected animal can also transmit rabies if the saliva comes into contact with the eyes, mouth or nose. As a precaution, kindly disinfect the area by washing thoroughly using antiseptic solution like Dettol or Povidine-iodine. Hope the information provided would be helpful. All the best."},{"Patient":"My mom took a sleep aid pill on June 25, 2017 and she finally was able to go to sleep but now tonight when she feel asleep she keeps waking up with her heart beating really fast and then after a while it slows down what does this mean?

Since childhood I always used to drink boiled water and never had any waterborne disease. But around 2.5 years back the entire family met with an accident in U.P and I was forced to drink non boiled bottled water. As a result I got typhoid and jaundice within some month's time. I was treated with monocef injections for both the infection and was cured. Now after almost 2 years after the first typhoid infection I got fever and widal was tested positive. I was hospitalised and was treated with monocef 2gm injections. The course of 10 injection got over on yesterday. Unlike last time when I was completely cured after course of antibiotics, I still feel very weak and is having cough and headache even now. The blood culture, LFT,and sonography results are normal as on last Saturday. Medical History As a child I was treated for primary complex but is not aware of much details as I was really young at that time. I think  the tablet name was R-Cin. And I also remember that doctors used to give me septran so often (I used to fall sick so frequently..say 3 times a month in childhood). I was treated with Augmentin (amoxicillin/clavulanate potassium)  couple of times in the last 3 years.(as I often don’t get cured by mild antibiotics).I have been given many antibiotics since childhood and have developed resistance to ones like ciproflaxin gradually. Last year when I got sinus infection I didn’t respond to medicines for long and finally responded to linezolid. I have undergone laproscopic Cholecystectomy due to multiple stones. Though I dont remember the names strong antibiotics where used then also. I am worried right now as I am still feel sick after the completion of monocef injections. I wonder whether I have developed a resistance for the same. I am not sure whether it is common to get headaches and cough even after completion of medicines. Please let me know your comments on the following. 1. Am I getting resistant to antibiotics due to the increased use of the same by doctors? 2. If so, Is there a way to get rid of the resistance. 3. My immunity seems to be very low. Since childhood I get infected very soon. Even if someone in close contact (Dad, Mom or colleagues in office) gets fever I gets infected. What can I do to increase immunity. (I am so allergic to citric fruits. I get throat infection if I take them.) 4. How can I be completed cured from typhoid? How can I make sure that I don’t come back again. 5. I do not take oily/spicy food and is a pure vegetarian. What can I add to food habits so that I can be more healthy?","Doctor":"Antibiotic resistance occurs slowly and as per your history, you have responded to the medicine well. There are different groups of antibiotics and you have had antibiotics from different groups at different times so the likelyhood of you developing a resistance is less. Monocef is pretty effective against Salmonella infection and having a course twice doesn't necessarily mean you will develop resistance. As far as the weakness is concerned, that lingers up to 6 months after an episode of typhoid. You must have a very nutritious diet and at the same time, it must be easily digestible. Boosting up the immunity is extremely important here to prevent infections. Have a well balanced meal. Protein like pulses , soya bean, green leafy vegetables, nuts, milk must be a part of your diet everyday. You've mentioned you're a pure vegetarian yet if it is possible, try including eggs in your diet. Another thing to be included is fruits, any seasonal fruit should be a part of your daily diet. Have a course of vitamin B complex for a month. To avoid recurrence of the infection, build up your immunity and avoid food and water which has even the remotest chance of being contaminated. Eat freshly cooked meals and ensure appropriate hand hygiene while handling food. And yes, avoid eating anything not prepared at home for at least a year."},{"Patient":"My Grandma is currently in hospital recovering from brain surgery and has had a Tracheotomy and also a line through her stomach for food.

Is any one able to give me more information on this infection? Is treatable and what are the long term effects of this infection? Also, how is this infection contracted in the first place?","Doctor":"Citrobacter koseri is a gram negative bacteria found in the body.

Intestinal lymphomas can be confirmed by biopsy only.If you are very anxious about it, discuss biopsy options with your gastroenterologist.Dietary changes are a must to avoid increased flatus and gastrointestinal disturbances.

Only irregularities were as follows : mitral leaflets are mildly thickened in appearance. Mild to moderate mitral regurgitation is detected. Mild tricuspid regurgitation detected.

It appears to be symptoms arising from complication of typhoid fever involving gastro intestinal tract or a relapse due to antibiotic failure or resistance. To confirm relapse blood culture test negative is not sufficient as in 30-40% sensitivity to blood culture is low. Another method to test the relapse is testing antibodies in blood known as Widal test or IgM antibodies against specific typhoid antigens.If all the above mentioned test confirms no ongoing infection the symptoms of gastritis must be considered to be complication of typhoid fever which is not uncommon.

I had a sensation that I had something in my mouth (like a piece of food or something) but i couldn't dislodge it.  Looked in the mirror and was shocked to see this 1/4 inch long stalk like growth coming out of my tongue","Doctor":"Hi,As you saw in the mirror and found out the growth, it suggests that you do not have pain in the area. Any unusual growth on the tongue or any other area in the mouth should be physically examined by the dentist promptly.There are many reasons that can cause growth on the tongue. I can explain you some of them here:- our tongue normally has many papillae on tongue that give us the sensation of taste and temperature. If these papillae get irritated due to some foods, hormones or stress, they might get enlarged and show the growth. It usually requires no treatment and disappears on its own.- A viral infection can also cause such growth, mostly Human Papilloma Virus (HPV). It usually has a stalk like structure as you described. It can be removed with surgery or laser. - If there is continuous irritation in the area, it can give rise to traumatic fibroma. It is pink and painless. For the treatment, the irritating factor has to be removed along with fibroma.- There are lymphatic glands present in the area that may get enlarged due to bacterial infection. The growth resolves when the infection is treated with antibiotics.- Last but not the least, it could be cancerous though most growths on the tongue are not. In that case, it may need to be biopsied, and according to the stage of the cancer, surgery, chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy are given.However, a growth on the tongue should not be ignored and should be diagnosed and treated as soon as possible.I hope this information helps. Thank you for choosing HealthCareMagic. I wish you get cured of the swelling soon.Best,Dr. Viraj Shah"},{"Patient":"hi Dr., my grandmother, aged 70 years, started this itch in her head...when cleant it she found big lies. But they were bigger then normal head lices. later, we found a sweater (which my uncle wore when he visted Leh and Ladakh) and it had similar lices it in. Alot of them. We immediately washed the sweater in hot water with alot of dettol and Rin. But it does not stop spearding in my grand mom hair. She is in a lot pain and highly irritated. has lost alot of hair as well. When she will clean her hair with Lice special shampoos it will come out and then the hair is wet after bath it will look clean but after a while they are back. Please help. We are desperate. Nothing seems to work and we cant find out what creature is that. what to do?","Doctor":"Hi, Thanks for posting in HCM. I have read your description and understand your concern. Head lice can be difficult to treat due to the time-consuming, precise nature of treatment and high re-infestation rate. The following things can be done to overcome the problem: 1. Wet combing - It is a method that involves removing the head lice by systematically combing the hair using a special fine-toothed comb. 2. Lotion or sprays - A lotion or spray should only be used if a living (moving) head louse is found. 3. Washing clothing: The most common way to kill body lice and eggs is to wash clothing and bedding in hot water [130°F (54.5°C) or higher]. 4. Permethrin creme rinse 1% which is a common first choice for treating head lice. If it does not respond to above measures, you need to go for: 1. Benzyl alcohol 5%, which is applied to the hair on the head, left on for 10 minutes, and then rinsed off. or2. Malathion lotion which is applied to hair on the head, left on for 8 to 12 hours, then rinsed off. If lice are still present 7 to 9 days later, a second treatment must be done.

To treat pinworm infection, it is recommend an antiworm medication like Albendazole 200mg, which is given in one dose and repeated in 2 weeks. Although medicine takes care of the worm infection, the itching may continue for about a week. Regular hand washing and routine household cleaning, including frequent changing of underwear and bed linens will help prevent the spread of pinworm infection within the family and its reinfection.

It seems that the topical cream you are applying is not reaching the fungus strongly to eliminate it. I would advise you to do a systemic course of anti-fungal drug.

I have chronic sinus infections, chronic swollen lymph nodes (within the past two months they have grown in size. The one on the right side of my neck is about 2'') and chronic migraines. All of my symptoms are worse on the right side of my body, but my left side recieves pain as well. I have been to 8 different doctors (and an ent) within the past 3 weeks. My blood tests have come back normal. I have been prescribed antibiotics, pain killers, and medicine for my upset stomach. Each doctor dismisses the pain as if it isn't real. I have an entire bag filled with prescriptions but they only mask the pain. I just don't know who or where to turn! since I am young I cannot afford insurance. I am worried that my lymph nodes could be related to something more serious. I had an xray done on my neck and nothing abnormal showed up. The pain is worst in the mornings after I have been in bed. It gets worse when I am under stress. At best it is a dull ache. About 10-30 times a day I get a sharp pain in the lymph nodes. Within the past year I have been on steriods about 3 times to \\"decrease the swelling\\" which works for a week or two and then it returns. Please help! Thank you!","Doctor":"HI, thanks for using healthcare magicAs you would know, lymph nodes normally respond to inflammation in the area in the area where they drain.Normally if the infection or source of inflammation resolves, the nodes would decrease in size after 4 to 6 weeks.With a history of chronic or persistent infection, there may not be a time for them to return to normal size.The blood tests would have likely included a complete blood count which would have assessed the white cell count.The most dangerous reason for enlarged lymph nodes would be cancer and this would cause a change in the white cell count.If there is no significant change in white cell count then there should be no life threatening problem presentI hope this helps"},{"Patient":"Hi I am having tests for Dilated cardiomyopathy and am currently awaiting the results of my stress and rest tests MIBI.

These molecules are given for runny nose, itchy eyes, sneezing etcetera due to allergic reactions. They do not have any severe side effects except some patients may experience gastrointestinal symptoms and drowsiness. There are cases where this medication has been given for 6 months to patients as per physician's instructions. However, as you are feeling good with one or two doses only, you may feel to avoid taking it for next 30 days. I can understand your concern. In that case, you can take this medication for 5 days and then discontinue. However, I would like to caution you to keep extra doses with you so that you can start them if the symptoms appear again. If the symptoms do appear again, I would recommend taking the dose for full month as per advised by your consulting physician. If you feel you get these symptoms more while walking on grass, you can try some days not walking on grass and see if symptoms happen. This can help you to decide if you are allergic to grass or not.To be absolutely sure what you are allergic to, you can get your blood tested in laboratory for Allergy Test.

Infectiousness of TB patients diminishes rapidly once effective treatment is initiated. There is considerable evidence that patients are no longer infectious after 2 weeks of treatment.

They have three consecutive negative AFB sputum smears collected in 8- to 24-hour intervals, out of which at least one being an early morning specimen2. Their symptoms have improved clinically. For example: they are coughing less and they no longer have a fever3. They are compliant with an adequate treatment regimen for 2 weeks or longer.

ALL OF MY LYMPH NODES literally every single one you could think to feel you can feel. are not only large but 90% of them all are solid. rock hard. not like they used to be... (large but still squishy.) most alarming for me are the ones in my  left groin. though last yr i had the ones on my right groin biopsied. my biggest concern with these are i not only feel the node its self but the entire lymphatic structure in my groin to be enlarged and very solid. i feel the stem system of one leading to the other. and they have only grown larger never do they shrink..ever. i read that most people vary depending on how their body responds to it, but should mine still be responding like this? i know it sounds as though Ive begun obsessing over my lymph nodes but i assure you believe it or not i really don't. for the most part i pay no mind to them at all except for public/social situations they come to mind only because they are quite visible on my neck when having a conversation with me. lately Ive been experiencing a random burning sensation at different times throughout the course of a day which feels like someone placing the head of a match on my skin. tolerable in pain but a very awkward sensation i can only describe as a burning.  could the colon problem and the lymph nodes be related? should my nodes have gone down? should haart have made any difference by now? what could be going on with my butt :( lol ? is this common? should i really go for another biopsy again? am i just one of the unfortunate who will always suffer from enlarged lymph nodes even ones obvious to other people looking at me? my numbers are fine what else can i do to not look sick? sorry for all the questions my infectious disease doctor is awful with answers.  they attempted to do a colonoscopy but my insurance denied the first request, its been resubmitted... what could the mucous be i haven't had sex in ages... don't know how i ever could :(please.. give me your answers... i need them. i'm going nuts. thanks in advance,S-","Doctor":"Thanks for asking at Healthcare Magic. I read your question and I understand your concern. Enlarged lymph nodes, hard in consistency has two possibilities 1.lymphoma as non Hodgkin lymphoma is common in your case which has very slow growth2. immunological reaction to ART.

Could the HPV lay dormant for 4 years?! because as I said before my last year test was clear. Or could the HPV be transmitted without sexual intercourse? Is jacuzzi or viginal douche can cause or transmit the HPV ? Thanks","Doctor":"Hello,You have been diagnosed with HPV does not mean that you have been infected with HPV recently. HPV can stay inactive or dormant in out bodies for many years without being detected in symptoms or in reports. So it is possible that you may have been infected with the virus 4 or even more than 4 years ago.The main route of transmission of HPV is via sexual intercourse with infected person only. The other routes of transmission like through shared objects or sharing jacuzzi have very rare possibilities of transmission of disease. A person can transmit HPV if he/she touches own genitalia and then touches other objects or hands of people and other people touch objects and then their genitalia. This possibility is also rare, though.One more fact just for your knowledge about transmission of HPV: A mother can pass this virus to baby while delivering the baby.I hope this information helps.

Pilonidal cyst occurs at the bottom of the tailbone (coccyx) and can become infected and filled with pus. It causes swelling, redness and burning sensation when it becomes infected. A doctor can diagnose a pilonidal cyst by taking a history and performing a physical exam. It can be managed conservatively when it is diagnosed early on, wherein, if you aren’t experiencing severe pain and there’s no sign of inflammation. It is likely that your doctor will prescribe a broad-spectrum antibiotic and pay particular attention to hygiene. If you have a recurring symptoms or if you have more than one sinus tract, your doctor will recommend a surgical procedure. In this, the surgeon will open the lesions, removing all of the pus and debris. Subsequent follow-up would be necessary. Kindly consult Surgeon in this regard for proper assessment and management.

The virus mainly transmits through infected person's vaginal secretions, saliva and semen and blood.Oral sex is one of the highly possible ways of transmitting the virus. So I feel sorry to inform you that oral sex is not a good idea and you should refrain from it until your consulting physician gives you  clean chit from being a carrier of the virus. Giving your partner oral sex may transmit the virus through your saliva, and if he gives you oral sex, then you can transmit it through vaginal secretions.However, hugging, holding hands and dry kissing does not transmit the virus. Deep kissing transmits virus through saliva so you should refrain from it.I hope this information helps. Thank you for choosing HealthCareMagic.

There may be unexplained interactions between efficacy of the vaccine & alcohol intake.2. Rabies vaccination provides immunity against rabies infection while consumption of alcohol decreases the body immunity.3. Individuals who receive the anti rabies vaccine may experience symptoms such as headache, nausea, dizziness, etc. which are similar to the symptoms experienced by intake of alcohol.4. The symptoms of alcohol intoxication can mimic the symptoms of rabies infection: confusion, agitation, anxiety, muscle issues. It would be hard to tell if your symptoms are from the alcohol or due to rabies infection itself.Based on the above mentioned facts, it is better your friend should avoid alcohol consumption.Best of your health."},{"Patient":"I am a diabetic person, right now I am taking 3mg glimp and gliptamet 850mg everyday.

For now, I suggest you get the pus drained from those swellings on the chest and get a culture done for that pus sample.Drainage of the pus will lead to faster healing of the wounds and the foul smell will reduce.Proper cleaning and dressing of those wounds will also reduce the foul smell and cause faster healing.If augmentin does not show any reduction in infection after 5 days, repeat culture is recommended.I am also suspecting that you are very anxious about these wounds which is increasing your stress levels.I suggest you relax and take appropriate steps to get those wounds dressed and treated.You will definitely see improvement within a week.Wishing you a fast recovery.thanks."},{"Patient":"I have two small holes in the right pit of my arm.

I am freaking out, and have no time to see a doctor due to finals. What could this be?","Doctor":"Hi and thanks for being part of our virtual clinic! I understand your concern can give you some advice:1. Skin boils are caused by bacteria. Whether from infection or from a clogged hair follicle, they can occur anywhere on the body and are usually painful2. Within a day or two, the bump or bumps begin to fill with pus. Boils continue to grow over several days or weeks, with more and more pus accumulating inside. 3. Boils can appear almost anywhere on the skin. They occur more often on hairy parts of the body, where the infection may begin in a hair follicle.4. Poor hygiene and poor general health are risk factors for skin boils. People with diabetes, which can interfere with the body's ability to fight infection, or with other immune-suppressing conditions, are also at risk. Skin problems like acne or eczema can make it easier for the bacteria to get in.5. Keep the area clean, but don't scrub or pick at it. Doing so can make the infection worse. A home treatment that may help is a warm compress. Warm compresses may help the boil rupture more quickly. To make a compress, soak a washcloth in warm (not boiling) water and place it over the boil. 6. You can use Bactroban cream and ointment both contain the active ingredient mupirocin, which is an antibacterial medicineIn case of getting worse, contact your doctor and write us againAll the best!"},{"Patient":"I am a sugar patient suffering from the last 7 years.By taking medicines it is under readings of 100 before breakfast and 180 after taking breakfast with the gap of 2 hours.

Complete bed rest as best treatment for viral fever is to sleep it off.2. Drink sufficient water to keep your body hydrated.3.

It has now re-occurred.  Do you think the two are related?  Has the hip infection moved?  Is it possible?Sharon","Doctor":"Hi,Welcome to HCM.I understand your concern regarding your husbands recurring infection. The most common cause of recurrent infection is the occurrence of resistance in bacteria causing infection. The bacteria develop resistance due to prolonged use of antibiotics and irrational use of broad spectrum antibiotics.It is very necessary to do a culture and sensitivity of the pus from the wound before continuing any antibiotic.I suggest you get a repeat culture and sensitivity of both hip joint wound and the hernia wound and get a prescription for appropriate antibiotic based on that test.You can also detect if the same organism has caused infection in both sites.There is a possibility of the organism causing infection in the hip spread to the hernia due to close vicinity of the wounds, but it should be confirmed by culture only.Proper care and dressing of the wounds is a must to decrease the occurrence of infection.

I understand your concern regarding necessity for vaccination. Based on the details mentioned in your query, you do not require vaccination for this episode as there was no direct exposure to the animal. However, as you mention that there is a chance of getting exposed to wild animals due to your location, pre exposure prophylaxis can be recommended. You have to take three doses of the rabies vaccine on 0,3,7 days with 0 being the first dose, followed by vaccination on 3 rd day and then the seventh day.

I was diagnosed with severe food allergies ten years ago, but can't afford new testing (and I know your allergies can shift). I have the symptoms of hypothyroid, but my initial test shows that I'm in the normal range. I am fatigued, even when I am regularly exercising.

An ultrasound scan and a couple hormone tests which will give an idea about the heavy menstrual bleed. Having periods once every 3 weeks is normal. I don't understand what you mean by allergies shifting. When you are found allergic to certain food unfortunately it lasts life long and the only thing you can do is to avoid foods that you know you are allergic to. A couple of explanations for your symptoms are Anemia and PCOS. These are only possibilities, you need a test or two to confirm whether you have this or not(CBC and Ultrasound Abdomen). Donot allow the internet to mislead you and donot take undue stress by what you see online. Many patients with hypothyroidism donot have half the symptoms mentioned online. So see a gynaecologist who will be able to help you figure out what is wrong ( if anything is wrong at all :) ) . You can be active and eat well but being stressed out can also cause you to gain weight. Practice relaxation exercises. Skin in the ear lobes are very thin and a capillaries can burst with little pressure it is not an indication of anything serious. Do not worry. I hope this helps.

This is a life threatening complication.I strongly recommend you see a general surgeon who could assess the size of the defect and advise a proper plan of action.I would do a physical exam, assess your medical /personal history and risk factors. I would also request an Ultrasound or a CT scan of the Abdomen.Depending on the findings, a treatment plan will be advised.Surgery is the only definitive treatment. a wait and watch plan may be an option if defect is very small.Avoid 'pushing' or straining. don't lift heavy objects or do any activity that makes the hernia appear.

If symptoms don't resolve within 2 days, go for blood test for Complete Blood Count (CBC) and urine routine test. Do complete the course of Levoflox if you start it. I hope this solves your query. Wishing you a veru healthy life ahead. Thank you for choosing us to help you.

Monospot test should be done to identify this virus (EBV) which causes mononucleosis.

In an effort to breathe I was doing this weird cough-like function, like 10 times, which didn't change the situation. I felt that only minimal or no air at all was allowed in. I had a bottle of water near me so I drank some and after that I was able to breathe better, though I don't know if that's what helped me. However I was somewhat scared since this has never happened to me before, so I went to the ER.There, the doctor did a few basic tests, heard my breathing, checked my throat, took my blood pressure and a blood sample for blood tests, mostly to see the oxygen levels, as well as a chest area x-ray, and asked me the usual questions, like if I've been sick and taking any medication, which are both negative. He also asked me if I felt anything weird still and I said my throat was sore though it may have been just because of the effort it took to breathe earlier.The doctor found everything normal, my blood pressure was surprisingly good too since I usually have a little bit hypertension, so he sent me home and I was frankly relieved, though I didn't feel like going back to sleep, in the end I fell asleep. It has now been 5 hours since the incident, and my throat still feels sore and weird, perhaps more so than previously, so I'm worried the episode will happen again.Other information the doctor asked me, in case you need it too, is if I smoke, which I don't personally though I live with chain smokers so the house is often full of smoke, if I have any known allergies, which I don't, to my knowledge, as I only remember having an episode like 10 years ago but we never figured out what it was that I reacted badly to, with rashes and itch all over my body at the time, and it has never happened since. Anyway, I also feel like I may be coming down with a fever now, though the doctor took my temperature as well and while I didn't ask how it was he didn't mention anything about it.So, what could this be, waking up unable to breathe, and still feeling sore after 5 hours despite the ER doctor finding everythingi n order?","Doctor":"I have read all your question in detail first I would like to ask you* do you have snoring?* frequent Nasal stuffiness/blockade ?I want to know this also because sudden awakening from sleep and feeling of sob may be due to sleep apnoea as well .and of course your home environment (chain smokers) is also not good.and sore throat with fever may be due to viral or bacterial infectionso you can take some broad spectrum antibiotics, take hot fluids  and I would suggest saline gargles as wellI hope my answer will give you satisfactiongood luck"},{"Patient":"hi my name is michael collins can you help me with a problem i have? i have severe itching aroundn the anus and scrotum area i have tried various creams but nothing works it like a sweat rash but worse with dry and flakey skin almost like ecsema can you please advise to what this is and a possible cure because the more i scratch the more painfull it becomes and it's impossible not to scratch","Doctor":"helloaccording to your statement you may be having dermatitis? so you can try some anti allergic skin creams like c.s creams, and antibiotic cover aswel and anti histamines after seeing to some dermatologist  i hope my answer will somehow satisfied yougood luck"},{"Patient":"i had an infection in my navel recently and i sprayed it out with my shower head. afterwords i went to swab it out and it appeared(felt) like it had opened.

Any other complaints apart from fever and soar throat like cough dry or wet/ burning urination/ any rash or boils on body/ abdominal pain?If she does not have any other complaints apart from soar throat and fever of  less than 7 days duration then its likely to be due to pharyngitis which is throat infection.Most throat infection are viral and resolve on their own without need of antibiotics. However if she also has cough/ neck node swelling ,the cause will be bacterial and she will need simple antibiotics like amoxicillin or azithromycin tablet for course of 5 days. Contact your local physician for examination to find if she needs antibiotic.In addition to this for reducing the fever, paracetamol tablet needs to be given one tablet 2 times a day at 8 hrs gap and maximum upto 3 times a day if the fever comes in between.

I have also noticed on the discharge note under procedures it says Hydrosalpinx and this was never mentioned in hospital (i now know what it means after researching on the web). I am so confused and now have no idea what the laporoscopy was for?? please help Thanks","Doctor":"Thank you for your query.Would you please clarify a few things for me?1) how old are you?2) have you had any abdominal or pelvic surgeries?3) have you had any pelvic infections?4) do you have children?I understand your concern and confusion. I will do my best to clarify this for you.The ovaries and fallopian tubes are paired structures ( one on each side). The ovaries and the fallopian tubes are in close proximity ( to facilitate retrieval of the released egg) and the tubes connect to the Uterus, one on each side.During each menstrual cycle, follicles (in the ovaries) develop, one of which will release the egg(ovulation) which is collected by the fallopian tube and transferred into the uterus. If it meets sperm on the may, it may get fertilized and develop into an embryo and implant in the uterus , resulting in pregnancy.While the egg develops and is released, the inner lining of the uterus (endometrium) also develops and prepares itself for receiving an embryo. In the absence of pregnancy, this lining is shed and a period/menstruation results.Endometriosis is a condition where this lining grows elsewhere (other than inside the uterus), like on the ovary, tubes, abdominal organs and wall. Chocolate cysts (due to the chocolate coloured fluid in the them) or endometriotic cysts form and can be problematic (cause pain, inflamation, infertility)Ovarian cysts include different types of cysts (functional, dermoid, endometriotic, tumors)small (less than 5cms) functional cysts are mostly benign and go away on their own in a couple of months. Large & persistent functional cysts, dermoid and complex cysts, need to be removed and examined assess underlying pathology.Endometriotic cysts need to be decompressed and the condition medically/hormonally controlled to preserve and enable fertility.Hydrosalpinx - fluid collected within the fallopian tube. normally the fluid inside the tube is drained out into the abdominal cavity which gets absorbed by the body. when this outflow is blocked by cysts, scars due to infection and surgery (adhesions), fluid build up and enlarges the tube exponentially causing severe damage, sometimes irreversible.The underlying causes need to be diagnosed and treated promptly to preserve the tube and its function.This is done by puncturing/removing cysts through surgery (commonly laparascopically) and draining the fluid from the tube in addition to antibiotics/antiinflammatory agents/ hormonal therapy (depending on the cause)From your query, I gather that you may have had endometriosis or ovarian cysts that needed decompression (laparaoscopy). these cysts may have closed up your tubes (directly by pressure or indirectly by causing inflammation) - leading to Hydrosalpinx.Your tubes would then need to be unblocked to preserve normal function and prevent complications like a recurrence of hydrosalpinx and infertility issues. The extent of blockage may be diagnosed by pushing a dye through your uterus and watch as it passes through your tube into the abdominal cavity (detected by an X-ray). If there is no blockage both sides will shown dye in the abdominal cavity. This procedure may also serve to unblock the tubes (uncomplicated blockage).On your next visit, you could confirm these interpretations and ask about how it affects your fertility and your life in the long run. All treatment options should be discussed based on possible complications.you have the right to answers. Ask , insist if necessary. this is your body and your responsibility. Doctors are there to help!hope I have shed some light on the matter.Please egt back to us if you need further clarification. wish you good health"},{"Patient":"Gud eveng Sir, Sorry I Will not b able to talk completely in english.

Prolonged fever and rigors can be due to various reasons. As there is non fever intervals  for 2 days possibility of malaria and typhoid should be ruled out. Typhoid serological test should be done. Temperature should be recorded graphically 4 hourly which gives a pattern of type of fever. Peripheral smear for malaria should be done when having high temperature. This will help to rule out malaria. Possibility of abscess in various portions of body should be ruled out also by ultrasounds or CT scans if necessary. By finding out the exact reason it will be easy to manage it. Hope this may help you. Let me know if anything not clear.Thanks."},{"Patient":"Hi my two year old daughter is getting over an ear infection (7th day on antibiotics) and fever shot up to 102 out of no where.

Hello Doctor, I have been suffering from loose mostions 1-2 times a month for the last couple of months. A few days back, I had loose motions (like in diahorrea). ( I am from India, travel to mideast for work and was on vacation in  Singapore) On day two while I had loose motion I had severe shivering for @ 30 mins followed by fever (I took a Crocin while shivering) but was ok in the evening, I also took metrogyl. The third day too I has similar shivering followed by fever. My doctor asked me do blood test for Malaria, typhoid and stool test The stool test shows Ova absent, Bacteria +, Salmonella typhi \\"O\\" positive 1:160 \\"H\\" positive 1:80 Questions 1. How severe is my stomach infection and Typhoid infection. as -I am not having fever since 24 hrs -No loss of appetite - and have been gaining weight 2. What is the diet to be taken a. Wheat bread? b. pulses? c. yogurt? d. Spicy food (esp the indian kind) e. Which fruits and vegetables  (banana, papaya, ?, raw or cooked) f. egg and meat?","Doctor":"Thank you for your query.Typhoid fever is an enteric (intestinal) fever that is caused by salmonella typhi/paratyphi.This usually starts as high fever (102- 104F)which may be associated or progress with gastric (stomach), intestinal symptoms, pulmonary (lung) and systemic( whole body) symptoms.Loose stools, abdominal pain, bloating, lung infections, sepsis (overwhelming infection that spreads to the blood) may occur.The reliability of the stool and blood test depends on when , during the course of the illness, the tests were done.This can be concluded based on a detailed medical history, recent travel history and risk factors.Based on your query, you seem to have taken the blood test too soon (first week) to show an accurate titre. The 'H' agglutinin titre (negative for you- positive if it is 1:200 titre )is more reliable than the \\"o\\" agglutinin titre to support the diagnosis of Typhoid.however, it is possible that you may be a carrier (stool test shows bacteria- unspecific)To address your concern, severity is based on clinical manifestations and extent of disease rather than lab resultsYou seem to be having a mild diarrhoeal illness which is self limiting.Currently diet restrictions include oily and spicy food. Avoid junk food , carbonated and sugary drinks. Have as much fresh fruits and vegetables as you can.Remember to wash them and cook it well. While travelling, you could also peel the skin of the fruits to prevent a possible infection. Hard boil the eggs and cook meat till fully done.If your symptoms persist, please visit your doctor , who may decide to prescribe appropriate antibiotics.I strongly urge you to avoid self medication, especially with antibiotics and once you start on them make sure you complete the full course (even if you feel better). This prevents drug resistance (over all and in your own body).Hope this helps.Wish you good healthPlease feel free to contact us should you require further clarification"},{"Patient":"i have a red bump on my clitorus, my periods are irregular even though im on birth control. im on alot of pain meds, and i take adderall. is it just my meds giving me problems? or is something wrong? the bump doesnt look like herpes, because its more of a dark pink splotch that hurts alot","Doctor":"Hi, Thanks for posting in HCM. I understand your concern. Presence of red bumps on the clitoris could be due to superficial skin infection like carbuncle, which is skin infection and is resulting in burning sensation. This can happen when you are using hormonal preparations such as birth control pills. You can overcome the lesions by doing the following: Kindly wash the area with mild antiseptic solution like Savlon twice everyday. After drying, apply Neomycin with Hydrocortizone skin cream over the lesion. Take antiinflammatory tablet Ibuprofen after food. Wear loose fitting undergarments till the lesions heal completely. Maintain clean genital hygiene. You may apply water based lubricant/moisturizer creams at bedtime to achieve soothening effect on skin. The lesions should subside and heal gradually.

I wanted to know that is it necessary to cut my hair for typhoid if yes.. Then please tell me in detail why its require...? Thanks Heena Naqib Ingaiya","Doctor":"Hi Heena, Thanks for posting in HCM. I understand your concern. It is not compulsory to cut hairs while having and getting treated for typhoid. However, it might have been advised so because many would experience severe hair fall during or after the period of illness and its treatment, which may be bothersome. This occurs due to a state of hair under-nutrition and falling out during the period of recovery (convalescence). The hair usually grows back within a few months. You can provide good nutrition to hair by eating a lot of fruit, dry fruit, legumes and fresh raw veggies to replenish the lost nutrients. Hope the information provided would be helpful.

What medications you have taken is right for yeast infection. However, you should have certain period of time for the infection to subside before indulging in sexual activities.

In any case, kindly wash the area with mild antiseptic solution like Savlon everyday and maintain good genital hygiene.

Again I checked after another 5 months time and found that SGPT 215.3 u/i and CPK 62 u/i. Further ,I  was a moderate drinker and gave up the habit soon after Leptospirosis. Please advise me ,reasons for high levels of SGPT and what i should do now. Thanks A patient from Sri Lanka","Doctor":"Hi, Thanks for posting in HCM. I have read the description and understand your concern. Leptospirosis is an infection caused by a  spirochaete bacteria called 'Leptospira'. Since the infection is known to cause liver dysfunction,  there is a moderate elevation of transaminases SGOT, SGPT enzymes and gamma-glutamyltransferase (GGT) levels. However, the levels should come back to normal by about 6 months. The enzymes continues to be elevated in your case could be due to alcohol consumption, as it would aggravate the underlying damage and delay the healing process. Since alcohol can cause inflammation on liver and amount to its damage, it would be advisable to limit your consumption or stop it completely. Along with it, you need to consume less fat diet and to supplement lipotrophic factors regularly to keep your liver healthy. Hope the information provided would be helpful. All the best."},{"Patient":"i had fissures problem some 8 months back at that time i take hot water bath and proctosedyl ointment at that time i got relief but from that time now and then i have a pain and burning sensation. this pain and burning sensation arises in 15 days interval .

The medications and measures what you are using for the problems with fissures would give you only temporary relief. Along with it, it is also essential to avoid constipation by taking fibre rich diet and consuming stool softners along with it as it would aggravate the condition. In initial stages, the medications and conservative measures would be helpful. In case your problem persists, you need to consult Surgeon, get examined clinically and undergo 'fissurotomy', which would get rid of the problem permanently.

Four days of fever with worsening symtoms and obvious changes in normal body behaviour warrants a visit to his doctor. A quick exam and some bloodwork(if required) , a throat swab or sputum culture will help the physician diagnose and treat it.Most viral infections are self limiting and recovery begins in about a week from the time of onset of symptoms.If he continues to have a high fever (102F), develops severe headache, lethargy, drowsiness, cough that lasts for more than a week (along with fever), or any worrying symptoms, take him to the ER right away.in the meantime, make sure he is well hydrated and takes lots of fluids and nutritious food.

I understand your concern. Testing positive for Hepatitis B alone will not help much to determine its management. ANTI HEPATITIS B ENVELOPE ANTIGEN needs to be tested and if it is positive, it means the body is fighting against the virus and helping to become non-infectious. HEPATITIS B ENVELOPE ANTIGEN also needs to be tested in addition and if found to be negative, it suggests that the person is non-infectious. Based on these two reports it can be interpreted what could be the stage of infection. All Hepatits B positive patient need not be treated. Treatment has to be initiated only if it is documented that the virus is actively multiplying in the body and it is causing injury to the liver. Hence, kindly consult Gastroenterologist or Physician for proper work-up with investigations and then administration of treatment accordingly. Hope the information provided would be helpful.

This may be due to common respiratory tract infection for which you were prescribed the antibiotic Azithral and you seem to have recovered from it. However, if you still suspect it to be due to tuberculosis then you are advised to undergo certain lab tests to confirm the TB infection like:1) Sputum for Acid Fast Bacilli staining (at least for 3 days) 2) Chest (X-Ray) 3) ESR examination. If these lab tests suggest tuberculous infection in that case you will have to take a course of anti TB medication for at least 6-9 months duration.Hope I could answer your query.

I appreciate your trust in HCM and assure you are on best portal on the globe for expert online medical services.I have thoroughly reviewed health query you raised, and well realize all of those concerns. Being your physician, I will take care all of them today and will extend my expertise to solve the problems.Based on what you said, there is no need of rabies vaccination for your housemate. When there is incident like this, the pet animal is observed for 10 days.

I have been married and in a monogymous relationship for 18 years. I started having symptoms of what I thought were a yeast infection 4 months ago. Itching and burning around my vaginal opening all the way back to my rectum. My doctor called me in medications but it never went away. When I went in to see her she swabbed my vagina and said I had no yeast or sign of bacterial vaginosis.  She said I wasn't red or swollen and that I didn't have an STD.  She told me to go home and get rid of all known irritants for a week and come back.  My symptoms flare during and after sex and subside slowly,over the course of 4 or 5 days.  But they never go away fully. I always have a low level of itching and burning until I have intercourse and then my symptoms flare right back up and take days to subside again. I don't know what the Dr wants to check me for when I go back. She basically told me I have no symptoms. I know I am group b strep positive. We didn't talk about it because at the time I didn't know it was relevant. She was not my OB. Could group b strep be causing my symptoms? Would she have checked for that when she was looking for yeast and bacterial vaginosis under the microscope? Would that have shown up? I will definitely discuss it with her when I go back but I wanted to know if she already ruled group b out when she said there was\\"no sign of bacterial vaginosis.\\" I can't imagine why I am so miserable, and I don't have any symptoms.  As far as irritants are concerned, she told me to not shave and see if I had changed soap or detergent or lubricant. I have not changed anything and I haven't shaved, but I'm not even hurting where I shave. I'm hurting where I sit and have sex. Occasionally we use Lubricant, but it has no perfumes or dyes or anything. And its the same brand we have used for 18 years.

What's wrong?","Doctor":"Hello Miss, Welcome to HCM, From your history its most probably seems Autoimmune progesterone dermatitis (APD). It is a rare skin condition in women that recurs in a cyclical manner corresponding to their menstrual cycles. It is thought to be a response of the skin to the hormonal changes that happen just before menses.Characteristically, the skin eruptions occur during the luteal phase or the late pre-menstrual phase of the cycle. This is when the blood level of the sex-hormone progesterone rises. The skin rash happens as an autoimmune response to the body's own progesterone, hence its name.Within a few days of menstruation when progesterone level falls, there is partial to complete resolution of the rash. It will recur during the next cycle.Some patients have had previous exposure to external progesterone in the form of oral contraceptive pills. This is thought to pre-sensitize patients to react against their own internal progesterone. However, not all patients with APD are exposed to previous hormone therapy. It has been postulated that these patients produce an altered form of progesterone that incites an immunologic response against it. In another theory, progesterone is thought to heighten a patient's hypersensitivity response to another allergen.How does progesterone dermatitis present?A variety of rashes has been described. The most common are urticaria and erythema multiforme. Other presentations include:Papulovesicles (eczema-like)Annular erythemaAngioedemaMouth erosions (stomatitis and aphthous ulcers)Itch (the most common complaint)Several other skin conditions may be more severe during the perimenstrual period, but these are not classified as autoimmune progesterone dermatitis. These include:Herpes simplex infection (cold sores)Acne and seborrhoeaRosaceaAtopic dermatitisContact allergy to nickelLupus erythematosusPsoriasisOn average, the skin rash happens 7 days before onset of menstruation and lasts for 1-3 days after menstruation.The age of onset is variable, the youngest case occurred at menarche and the disease can begin as late as 48 years of age. Autoimmune progesterone dermatitis Image provided by Sharon MortonAutoimmune progesterone dermatitisHow is progesterone dermatitis diagnosed?The diagnosis is usually made from the characteristic cyclical presentation.A skin-prick test with intradermal progesterone is helpful. Positive tests with progesterone can be fairly rapid, usually developing as urticaria within 30 minutes of inoculation, or delayed with rashes peaking at 24-48 hours.Provocative testing with intramuscular or oral progesterone can be performed as an alternative.Skin biopsy alone is seldom diagnostic. A variety of histological features have been described. Superficial perivascular mixed inflammation is the most consistent finding.How is progesterone dermatitis treated?If the skin problem is mild, it may improve with topical steroids (for eczema) and antihistamines (for urticaria). Severe disease may be treated with systemic corticosteroids.The production of progesterone can be suppressed with hormone-based therapy. This includes the use of conjugated oestrogen (American spelling estrogen), ethinyl oestradiol (estradiol), tamoxifen and danazol.Women with autoimmune progesterone dermatitis should try to avoid medications containing progesterone including the combined oral contraceptive pill, minipill, depo injections. The specific drugs to avoid include norethindrone, norgestrel, levonorgestrel.I hope this helps..Dr.Satyam Bhavsar (MBBS,India) :)"},{"Patient":"my father is suffering from typhoid fever from 15 days now fever is down in the morning and high in the evening doctors say that he is getting better but i m not satisfied what do u say also guide me about diet management","Doctor":"Hi thanks for asking question.I appreciate your concern.Here are some instruction for your father.First of all antibiotic like cefixime is taken for 10 to 14 days.Drink more water like cocconut water,fruit juices, vegetable soup etc.Take semisolid diet for few days.Take small meal at frequent interval.Avoid high fibre diet like whole grain , wheat bran etc .Avoid vegetables like cabbage, turnip, spicy food etc.Oily food not advisable during typhoid.The protein rich diet helpful like eggs.Drink more water and water should be filtered or boiled.Avoid smoking and alcohol.If still no benefit then intravenous antibiotic given according to culture and sensitivity.I hope my suggestions will be helpful to you.Wish you good health to your father.Thank you.Dr,parth goswami"},{"Patient":"hi so my friend's dog got in a fight with a raccoon. the raccoon died and the family sent it out to a lab to get tested for rabies. it did have rabies but the dog has its shots so she's fine. meanwhile my friend gave the dog a bath and touched saliva and blood I'm guessing from the raccoon. He's not getting his rabies shots just because that family doesn't really worry much and are more laid back. But later that week me and him hung out, were sharing drinks, food and kissing. I got rabies shots a couple years ago because a bat was in my house should i get my booster?","Doctor":"Hi.Your query is quite lengthy because you had to mention the details to me, but my response is going to be quite short and could have ended in a one-word answer as well, which is a 'yes', please do get the booster shots, there is no harm in it and you may as well benefit from it, both mentally and physically.Best wishes."},{"Patient":"For the past two weeks I have felt queasy, tired, and run a low fever (99.9). I also have discomfort in my left lower abdomen which my doctor thought was due to a twisted pelvis. He is an internist/osteopath so he adjusted it a week ago. I had a CBC run and all was good. I have an insect bite under my breast but did not think to tell him about it. Could it be related?","Doctor":"I dont think your symptoms are necessarily because of insect bite.  Low grade fever with malaise can occur in any infection - bacterial or viral in origin.  Depending upon the geography of your area, further investigations for malaria, dengue, typhoid, influenza etc may be required.  Undiagnosed fever for more than 2 weeks is not a good sign.  A mere CBC will not be helpful.  Depending upon your ESR and CRP levels, your treating physician should be planning further."},{"Patient":"I have been battling herpes (1&2) for over a year now. My symptoms include almost total fatigue, random spots (coldsore-esk, not lesions). When I go outside I feel it activated within my body and my mind feels clouded, as if I cannot think. I have also started to feel strain in my eyes, which is blurring my vision. My primary care believes it to be psychological since I am on acyclovir, but I know something is definitely not right. Who should I talk to? Is there a doctor who specialized in Std viral infections when they might be progressing towards keratitis or encephalitis? Would the eye doctor and/or neurologist handle this?","Doctor":"Please talk to an infectious diseases specialist first before concluding on your own that you are progressing towards keratitis or encephalitis.  If the condition is really bad the ID specialist may consider intravenous acyclovir for 7-10 days."},{"Patient":"Hi. I've been itching all over since a couple of hours ago.

Places I'm itchy: Along my stomach areaBack and front of my neckEntire ScalpInside my earsMy back ArmpitsUnder my chestAlong my bikini lineArms","Doctor":"Toxic shock syndrome usually presents with a very high fever.  I do not think this is TSS.  It appears more like a hyper sensitivity reaction to a recent food or drug that you may have taken.  It is not necessary that you should have prior allergy to that food or drug as hyper sensititivity reactions can get triggered even if you have tolerated the same substance before.  You should get a shot of dexamethasone from a doctor or a nurse - this will arrest the itching immediately."},{"Patient":"Dr. My question is about the hypertention.

What is the serious problem. My kidneys are okey and no other complications.. Can you advise please. Iam now 61 years old..l","Doctor":"Hi, One thing is very obvious as far as the hypertension is concerned. If you go on measuring the blood pressure on your own, it shows great variation every time you measured and this is happening due to over consciousness. Such reading may not be taken into consideration for medicine, actually, blood pressure needs to be measured by a physician. Measuring blood pressure on your own does not prove anything. It is just a monitoring and anyhow you have to see the physician for final confirmation. So if you get high blood pressure then consult the physician for confirmation and let the physician decide for any changes in medicine and other, else balance diet, exercise, low-calorie diet, cut down salt in the diet. You have not given the blood pressure measurement. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further.

Successful treatment is associated with a 4-fold or two-tube decline in titer (ie, from 1:32 to 1:8) 6 months after therapy for primary or secondary syphilis and 1 year after therapy for latent syphilis. RPR and VDRL titers are not interchangeable or convertible, so it is important to use consistent testing with a single method to monitor disease activity.

Then came the urge to urinate a lot. and after i would pee i would feel like I had to pee again. After again doing research online I came up with the conclusion i may have got a bacteria virus from her witch may have turned into a UTI. I have been treating it with all natural cranberry pills and lots of water. It doesnt burn when i pee and there is no other pain. Just peeing a lot but i am drinking a ton of fluids.

UTI and STD can have same symptoms. Yeast infection can coexist with other infections. But your symptoms are not just due to yeast infection alone.  STDs like Gonorrhea and Chlamydia can have just urethral discharge and pain or with urinary symptoms also. So better to have a urine routine and urine tests for Chlamydia and Gonorrhea.

At first night,I found that she had fungal infection and  when I tried to have sex with my wife, she somewhat resisted and said that I am not able to do properly and she was feeling pain.

For this reason, I recommend taking acetaminophen or ibuprofen for the pain.
