This happens in some more often than others. Cold beverages tend to cause more contractions than hot or warm drinks. Try to chew your food slowly and take the drink after you are done eating. Drinking during the middle of the meal sometimes you swallow more air which can add to the bloating or distension.

I am Bala, i am having stomach pain and black stools for past 2 years. i went to docter taken general checkup and check my stools that time there is no issue. but some times if i am take any spicy food, that time only i am getting abdominal bloting and i need to urgently push to rest room. please assit me.","Doctor":"Hello, cbalamuralee, Black stool can be due to a number of causes. If some one is taking Iron supplements (Vitamin) that can make the stool black. Also, large doses of Bismuth (Antidiarrheal drug-Over the counter) can give that color to the stool. Charcoal sometimes is used for food poisoning can also give black color to the stool. More importantly, if there is slow bleeding inside the stomach , the digestive process makes the blood black when it shows up in the stool. You state that you have had stomach pains for the past two years. Also, spicy foods make the condition worse. To me, it suggests that you indeed have stomach issues. It is possible that you have significant irritation of the lining of the stomach, may be small ulcers.If you are using any aspirin, Ibuprofen or other NSAIDS , I would recommend that you discontinue these. Sometimes bleeding could be intermittent, so your stoll may not always show black color. If you are over 45-50 years of age, I want you to see a gastroenterologist. You might need endoscopy to look for small ulcers. If you have significant weight loss , if you are anemic, these are warning signs and stomach cancer has to be considered.

Microscopic: WBC:6-8hpf, RBC: 0.2hpf, Epith Cells: Moderate, Bacteria: Few. thats all thank you. By the way Im 20 yrs old and this past few weeks I experiencing moderate pain in my lower abdomen and it s getting worst since its started last month. I had the pain every now and then lately.please help me thank you.","Doctor":"Hello, stephjoydelosreyes, Just from the urinalysis we are not able to tell whether you have infection or not. You do have few white cells and few bacteria. Unless you get a clean catch urine specimen and send it to the lab for culture, that can tell if you have infection. Also, if you are experiencing any burning on urination, frequency of urination, fever or chills, those go along with urinary tract infection. Lower abdominal pain could be due to constipation and build up of gas. Problems with prostate glan in men and uterine or ovarian problems in women can cause low back pain. Lower spinal involvement with disc or arthrtis can also do this. If you are into lot of lifting or bending, muscle and ligament sprain can give backache. I think I have given you some of the more common causes. Check with your doctor.

This is higher for her age. But as both the parents are taller, this cannot be taken as abnormal too.

Cow's milk protein allergy is a strong possibility as there as blood in the stool in exclusively breast fed baby.Suggestions -1. Mother should go off the cow’s milk products completely - including biscuits and chocolates and all products related to milk.2. Continue exclusive breast feeding and if it is not sufficient you can opt for Zerolac.3. Cow's milk protein intolerance in transient as it will go off as the kid grows up.4. Avoid all cow's milk products till the kid is 1 year age.5. Mother's milk is the best for good growth of the baby.

No brand of powder milk can match it. It's sad that you are not able to give breastfeeding to your baby. Did you ask your doctor or a lactation consultant for guidance regarding decreased milk? I suggest you meet one if you haven't as we need to examine you and find why you don't have enough milk.  Also some medicines can be given to increase mother's milk. Colic aid drops can be safely given to the baby for crying which is commonly due to colic. Foods other than milk can be started at 4-6 months after birth.

I suggest you not to use appetite stimulants on long run as they may cause drowsiness.Regards - Dr. Sumanth"},{"Patient":"My 14 yr old son has a red line going up his arm.

Last night after I came home from work I ate a hamburger that one of my family members made. Right after I started having these severe abdominal pains. It hurts to sit down. Hurts to stretch . Hurts to even breath. Then right after I feel like I have to throw up. It feels good when I hold breath for a few seconds. And now I m at work, and its just making the pain even worse. I took tums thinking it would help. It didn t even touch the pain. Please help me. I don t know what else to do to get rid of the pain. : (","Doctor":"Hi Such severe intensity stomach pain is not very usual in isolated stomach infection. In stomach infection the pain is colicky in nature, it is not a constant one. Was there any such episodes of pain abdomen and vomiting in the past as well? Suggestions: Oral anti-spasmodic analgesic tablets to relieve the pain as required. Oral proton pump inhibitors like pantoprazole- domperidone combination: once before breakfast, to relieve heartburn and gastritis. I would suggest oral antibiotics only in case of stomach infection after clinical examination In case these does not help , get a couple of investigations done : 1. Complete blood count 2. Serum amylase, serum lipase 3. Liver function test 4. Ultrasound abdomen These investigations would help to rule out any underlying intra-abdominal pathology such as acute pancreatitis or cholecystitis."},{"Patient":"I was just wondering it doesn't seem to bother him until I try to put something on it, but my 18 month old has a lot of redness around his anus.

Try to keep the area dry with gentle wiping.You can use Baby Johnsons Napkin for wiping. You can also give oral Zinc syrup as it helps in early recovery of dermatitis.Regards"},{"Patient":"Hi I have a 5 year old daughter who has a very pale skin complexion anyway but she has dark under her eyes and she gets increasingly run down during different periods of the year, although these can be on an ad hoc basis (so not just through winter). Throughout the year last year she was feeling ill and run down on a frequent basis (but with no cold or any other similar symptoms), sufferes from aches and pains in her legs (from her knees to even her ankles) and her wrists, sleeps for 12 hours a night but is always telling me she feels tired and now she says her heart is hurting her (I assume it is beating fast and yesterday morning she had only walked from the dining room into the kitchen when she told me). Also on an ad hoc basis she has a red flaring of the skin around her vaginal area and the only thing that will ease it is a cold wet flannel (all creams burn) and this only occurs when she is is in bed and has been sleeping. She had bloods taken last year on my insistence because I had had enough of being given the run around (they check her vitals at the doctors and because they are okay on the day they say there is nothing wrong). Not the pleasantest of experience for her and not something I wanted to do but I had to do it for peace of mind. Anyway, they all came back negative (I was surprised because I though her iron may be low). In the end the attributed it to the fact that she doesn t go to the toilet properly and the toxins from her stools are feeding themselves back into her body but she has never been a regular toilet go er. Any ideas as to what could be wrong? Many thanks Zoe","Doctor":"These all ate symptoms of anemia,a condition of low hemoglobin or red blood cells on the blood.However routine investigations may be normal at times . You should go for a detail peripheral blood film and also a serum folate level,  serum vitamin B12 levels and seum ferritin levels.Also the redness around vaginal area and that too only in bed is due to worm infestation. So you should deworm her by giving Tab.zentel. meanwhile you should start iron with folic acid and vitamin B 12 in the form of a syrup. The symptoms should abate."},{"Patient":"My son ran into a corner wall about 2 weeks ago.

The treatment is toilet training and  an anti cinstipatung agent like polyethylene glycol 3350(PEGRED 3350).

Because of pain while swallowing he might not be swallowing the sailva and this shy he might be drooling.I suggest you to wait and watch as he is otherwise active.

Your pediatrician was right in staring  steroid and inhaler. Fever of few days without any localizing signs could as well a viral illness. Usually rather than fever, what is more important is the activity of the child, in between 2 fever episodes on the same day. If the kid is active and playing around when there is no fever, it is probably viral illness and it doesn't require antibiotics at all. Once viral fever comes it will there for 4-7 days. So do not worry about duration if the kid is active.Paracetamol can be given in the dose of 15mg/kg/dose (Maximum ceiling dose 500mg per dose) every 4-6th hourly that too only if fever is more than 100F. I suggest not using combination medicines for fever, especially with Paracetamol.Regards - Dr. Sumanth"},{"Patient":"Hi my kid is 4 months old and having chest congestion, doctor has prescribed Ascoril Syrup .8 ml thrice a day. is it safe for infants ? also the baby is crying and feeling like uncomfortable with his tummy, and giving a weird reaction as if he wants to pass motion immediate.Could it be due to the chest congestion?Thanks for your answers","Doctor":"8 ml is a high dose for a child of this age.Again weight is more important for prescribing medicines in a child.

Apply cold compress (ice packs) over that area twice a day for 4 days.It would have been great if you had mentioned his age or his body weight.Still I can help you out.If he complains of pain or cries out on touching , give him syrup paracetamol (125mg/5 ml)  10 mg/Kg/dose  twice daily for 4 days.e.g if his weight is 20 Kg ,he requires 200 mg = 8ml = One and a half teaspoon  like that. It is easy.You can also take him to a paediatrician  . He /she can examine him and correlate clinically.Post any other question. We will be happy to help.Have a nice day. Regards."},{"Patient":"my child has a primary complex and the doctor advice that his medicine should take for 9months. i want to stop the medicine this coming feb.14 it is ok to stop.. feb 20 should be the last taking of medicine.. his medicine will last at feb 14 and i was thinking that will be the last so that i would not buy another medicine..it is ok if i stop..","Doctor":"HI...the treatment for primary complex is only 6 months.

Regarding diarrhea - Once it starts it will take 5-7 days to completely get better. Unless the kid's having low urine output or very dull or excessively sleepy or blood in motion or green bilious vomiting...you need not worry. There is no need to use antibiotics unless there is blood in the motion. Antibiotics might worsen if unnecessarily used causing antibiotic associated diarrhoea.I suggest you use zinc supplements (Z&D drops 1ml once daily for 14 days) & ORS (Each small packet mixed in 200ml of potable water and keep giving sip by sip) as hydration is very important and crucial part of treatment. If there is vomiting you can use Syrup Ondansetron as prescribed by your paediatrician.Regards - Dr. Sumanth"},{"Patient":"hi my 4 year old daughter went to her babysitter this morning feeling perfectly fine and after breakfast started vomiting and has been non stop vomiting all day and still vomiting up liquids this evening.

We have seen several doctors including a uroligist and they have ran all kinds of tests but cannot find anything. I am taking him tomorrow morning to see the uroligist.","Doctor":"There is surely something wrong. You also mentioned a history of blood in urine. This with pain usually happens with urolithiasis that is stone in the urinary tract. I suppose you should surely visit an urologist and get some more tests done to exclude the possibilities. Test should include a routine urine exam and also and intravenous pyelogram if previous ultrasonographies are normal."},{"Patient":"my son who is 18, weighs about 135 and is 6ft 3in started with dirahea the night before last, that subsided, and a few hours later he started with bad stomach pains, saying its like a cross between burning and stabhing.

This left with about 15% of the function in that kidney. at 5 years old he had a procedure to correct a problem with his bladder, which was allowing the urine to flow back into his kidney, and since then has been fine. about 2 weeks ago he became unwell, pain passing urine, pain in his flank, tired and with sweats. his doctor gave him a course of anti biotic but the flank pain, while it has eased, has not gone away. Should he be referred to hospital? how long does an infection take to clear and is it more serious because his kidney is already damaged?","Doctor":"Hi...I suggest you need to get him evaluated in a specialty center with good expertise in dealing with chronic kidney diseases. Courses of antibiotics like this is going to give only temporary relief. The duration taken for the infection to clear is not based on the remaining function of the kidney. It depends on the virulence of the organism and the patent's resistance power.I suggest you consult a nephrologist for this.Regards - Dr. Sumanth"},{"Patient":"My 5 yr old daughter has light vaginal bleeding after urinating.

Another important point here is about his nature as a child and adolescent. Does he like to talk to people? Does he have any phobias? Does he have friends? Does he is less interactive as a child? whether he was outgoing and playful child? Does he say or do anything unusual recently? Like talking alone, seeing things, animals, people? does he say that somebody is behind him to harm him? Does he fearful?Important here is to rule any possibility of personality disorder and psychotic disorder. If these symptoms are not present then he might be having depression and he needs drugs and psychotherapy. So first go for consultation to child and adolescent psychiatrist and ask for help. He will guide you further about what can be done and what are the options.

Before answering your query , I presume that your baby is otherwise doing well ie feeding well , gaining weight and is active .Newly born babies have thin skin , so they appear red . As baby grows , skin becomes thicker, so the complexion also changes and they become darker . Generally speaking babies born to fair parents have fair skin .This is most important and its determined by the genes the baby gets from parents.Also other factors which modify skin color is surrounding  weather ,  exposure to sunlight, diet , & pollution levels. Eg Too much sun exposure can make people darker . This does not mean , you must prevent your baby from all exposure to sun as some sunlight exposure daily  is necessary for good bone growth .Since many factors are there which determine skin color , its difficult to predict what complexion the baby is going to get ultimately .Also once your baby grows up , skin color may change depending on the factors  I already mentioned."},{"Patient":"During what was expected to be normal vag delivery,baby is born no heart beat .

Your pain might be caused by either stomach ulcer, gall stones or intercostal neuralgia (what is most probable). However it is always advisable to rule out heart attack or ischeamic heart disease when pain in chest appears. You should have an abdomen ultrasound (what should rule gall stones out), gastroduodenoscopy (to rule peptic ulcer out), some blood tests including pancreas and liver enzymes, magnesium and calcium level (shortage of this ions may result with some nerves irritation including intercostal nerves) an at least ECG to rule out heart problems.

Great kid who responds vigorously to doing things in an order not his norm......???","Doctor":"Hello thanks for asking from HCM for your health related queriesPulling of hair out, fear of going upstairs, dressing in particular order etc symptoms in a young child could denote some underlying anxiety. Such symptoms should not be overlooked and need proper evaluation and treatment. Dressing in particular order with family history of OCD can be an early sign of Obsessive and compulsive behaviour. Hair pulling can also occur due to compulsive behaviour due to trichotillomania. Consult a good child psychiatrist for his symptoms.OCD and trichotillomania are disorders of OC spectrum and usually respond to anti anxiety drugs. Fluoxetine is commonly used drug in such symptoms. The drug helps to reduce the compulsive behaviour and will reduce the anxiety and fear. Discuss with a psychiatrist for prescription of the drug.Thanks, hope this helps you.

However I also experience times where I can t take a breath with out feeling like my abdomen will shatter. I was thinking if it is a pedunculated tumor could it cause these problems. Or what does it sound like to you?","Doctor":"Hello, monni, I agree with your doctor that uterine tumors (I assume fibroids) are not causing the change in the color of your stools. Eventhough the color is usually brown , many different kinds of foods that we eat changes the color . For example if you eat a lot of spinach or greens then you can have green stools. If you eat a lot of carrots, your stool could be orangish. Beets can make your stool color red. You might want to add some fiber supplement to your diet daily and drink a little more fluids. Regular walking three times a week will help. I am not sure where you got the idea of pedunculated tumor ? Polyps or growths in the colon or large intestine can cause bleeding etc. Hope this would releive your concerns. Wish you good health."},{"Patient":"my 14 year old son has been refusing to go to school because he is sad. He has therapy with a psychologist but is not on medication.

I am a junior in high school and am writing an essay for AP English looking into how and if a teen (ranging between 14-18) can make rational long term choices if the brain doesn t fully develop until a person s early twenties. Adults look down upon marriage, tattoos, piercing, and so on but expect us to be able to choose colleges and careers at the same time. I would appreciate some help on understanding how the mind of an adolescent can make rational long-term decisions and if they truly are rational or simply impulsive? Thank you!","Doctor":"DearWelcome to HCMWe understand your concernsI went through your details. You are only aware of the mind's impulsive capacity. There are other aspects into decision making. Even a child can take decision, sometimes even long term decision if proper training is given. In an adolescent's case, he is not taking long term decisions based on his experiences or rational thinking, but taking decisions with an aim to fulfill it. Those decisions are coming out from so many scenarios, like self experience, input from elders, friends, teachers, well wishers, readings etc. He gets inspired from these things and takes the decision, and then pledge to stick to it. Once goal and a determination to stick to it formed, he can move forward even though obstacles troubles.If you still need my assistance in this regard, please use this link.

That is part of Obsessive behavior pattern. If your daughter is been treated for her OCD and ADHD,just intimate this matter too to the psychiatrist and he will take care of it.

Once it starts it will take 5-7 days to completely get better. Unless the kid's having low urine output or very dull or excessively sleepy or blood in motion or green bilious vomiting...you need not worry. I suggest you use zinc supplements (Z&D drops 1ml once daily for 14 days) & ORS (Each small packet mixed in 200ml of potable water and keep giving sip by sip) as hydration is very important and crucial part of treatment.

The different types of food and drinks we take have a direct effect on acid production. Tomato based products, too much milk (Contains calcium which stimulates acid), caffeine in coffee or tea, alcoholic beverages , all add to the problem. Smoking will make the reflux worse because of it's effect on the sphincter at the junction of espphagus and stomach. If you are not getting relief from taking anti acids such as gaviscon or Maalox, try taking 15 mg. of Lansoprazole or 20 mg. of Omeprazole about an hour before your main meal of the day. If needed you can take it twice a day. If symptoms persist after 4 weeks, I advice you to see a digestive disease specialist for further work up.

He says he does not feel bad but all he s done is lay around which is unusual! I am out of my home state and he has fl medicaid and What I have been told is his medicaid would not cover him in another state!! And I do not have his card on me!","Doctor":"Hi...fever with burning sensation could be a symptom of viral illness. Fever of few days without any localizing signs could as well a viral illness. Usually rather than fever, what is more important is the activity of the child, in between 2 fever episodes on the same day. If the kid is active and playing around when there is no fever, it is probably viral illness and it doesn't require antibiotics at all. Once viral fever comes it will there for 4-7 days. So do not worry about duration if the kid is active.Paracetamol can be given in the dose of 15mg/kg/dose (maximum ceiling dose of 500mg) every 4-6th hourly that too only if fever is more than 100F. I suggest not using combination medicines for fever, especially with Paracetamol.But if there is any rash or redness over the area of burning which you are quoting - I suggest you get him checked by a doctor.Regards - Dr. Sumanth"},{"Patient":"my baby is now at 1 yrs.& two months old his right testis is undescended it is at the end of the right inguinal canal (as per the report of ultrasound) this is his congenital for,therefore now can i think about orchidopexy? is the surgery invasive or non.?","Doctor":"HI...Orchidopexy is an invasive surgery and it is right time to go ahead with he surgery as per age specific guidelines.

I started applying this last week. The dry patches in her hands and legs are gone. However, I see many small rashes have appeared on her back. Some of them have yellow crust. The same red rashes with few of them having yellow crust have appeared in her eyelids too. I think it is not itchy, as my baby doesn t try to scratch it or behaves cranky. I still continue to use Aveeno eczema. Cud this be food allergy? I ve started solids for baby. She eagerly eats lures and cereal and doesn t behave cranky.","Doctor":"Hi...food allergy doesn't manifest like this. This is eczema. I understand your concern. As a matter of fact even my kid had this when young. The trick of the management is keeping the skin moist and never allowing it to be dry. For this oil massage and lotions like Oilatum will help.Regarding cure options - eczema is a sort of allergy...allergies can only be controlled and can never be cured. But usually kids grow out of it...that is as the age progresses, they become better starting from 6 months.Hope my answer was helpful for you.  I am happy to help any time.

You will need - 1. Antireflux therapy - Proton pump inhibitors + antiemetics2. Try to lie down in a propped up position. You should not be sleeping completely flatly.3.

An active is a well kid even if she/ he is not eating well. 2. Development of a kid is as important as or I would say even more important than growth alone.3. As the kids grow their interest in food decreases and interest in play activities increases so that they eat small quantity and run away to play. As parents we need to be more patient and feed than less quantity but more aliquots per day.4. This age rather than the quantity of the food I suggest you concentrate more on the number of times you feed her and also make whatever you feed her calorie dense by adding good amount of ghee to it.5. I suggest you not to use appetite stimulants on long run as they may cause drowsiness.Regards - Dr. Sumanth"},{"Patient":"i have just been kicked out of hospital as they wanted my bed and put as an out patient i was taken in on wednesday afternoon with severe lower abdominal pains the next day after a painfull sleepless night and inadiquet pain relief i had a scan the doctor who was very nice came to see me straight away and said i had a burst cyst on my ovary which had caused a foliacl to colapse and had free fulid in my pelvis he said the best thing to do was to leave it and see if it settles on its own over the next 24 hours if not he would do a laparosopy to drain the fulid which was irratating part of my bowel which wasnt working and make sure i didnt have endametriosis. over the next 24 hrs the pain didnt ease at all i was ignored when i asked for stronger pain relief . but then on the friday all of a sudden ( after hearing the nurses saying the needed 3 beds asap . i was told i could go home and another doctor came within 1o mins ta say i was going home and put as an out patient and would get an appointment in 4-6 weeks then left . is this safe to leave or should i go back im still very uncomfortable and have not had a bowel movement since tuesday when the pain started i have taken stuff for it but its not helped my stomach is still swollen","Doctor":"Hello. Welcome to hcm. Ruptures cyst with fluid in abdomen will be absorbed by our body and usually the symptoms get relieved on its own but some times laproscopy is needed to wash out the fluid in abdomen. It is not safe to stay at home when your symptoms still persist. The fluid might get infected or cause adhesions to intestine on long term. I advice you to visit your physician. You need to undergo laproscopy if pain persists or regular follow ups and ultrasound if the acute symptoms have subsided so that your follicles can be monitored and complications of fluid on long term managed.

He was sent to the pediatric ER because pediatrician doesn t know what to do. Their xray show that the constipation was still present, but not as prevalent.

Did your kid pass motion or meconium on day one of life?2. Since how long is the kid constipated?3. Does the kid have any bleeding along with hard stools?4. How much milk does the kid consume per day?5. Does the kid eat fruits and vegetables (fibre diet) appropriately?Suggestions:1. Natural methods are the best to relieve constipation.2. Constipation is a risk factor for UTI3. Maximum milk consumption per day should not exceed 300-400ml4. Minimum 3-4 cups of fruits and vegetables to be consumed per day5. Toilet training - that is - sitting in Indian type of lavatory daily at the same time will help a lot.Get back to me with answers to above questions.

Unless the kid's having low urine output or very dull or excessively sleepy or blood in motion or green bilious vomiting...you need not worry. There is no need to use antibiotics unless there is blood in the motion. Antibiotics might worsen if unnecessarily used causing antibiotic associated diarrhoea.I suggest you use zinc supplements (Z&D drops 1ml once daily for 14 days) & ORS (Each small packet mixed in 200ml of potable water and keep giving sip by sip) as hydration is very important and crucial part of treatment. If there is vomiting you can use Syrup Ondansetron (as prescribed by your paediatrician).Regarding diet - You can use cerelac...any flavour will do. Avoid fruit juices as they might aggravate diarrhea. You can give zinc supplements & ORS apart from normal vegetarian porridges & soups.Regards - Dr. Sumanth"},{"Patient":"Hi Doctor, We are blessed with TWIN GIRLS, they were born in the 30st week (in 7th Month of Pregnancy)..with a weight of about 1.6 Kgs & 1.8Kgs .

I feel that your baby is having cow's milk protein allergy. Unusually babies grow out of this sort of allergy by 1 year of age. My suggestions for you - 1. Mother should go off cow's milk protein completely. This means that you should avoid consumption of anything and everything related to cow's milk - like - milk/ curds/ ghee/ butter milk/ chocolates/ biscuits/ ice creams etc. Even while buying commercial food products, you need to see the ingredients and if they contain milk - do not consume them.2. Feed you baby only exclusive breast feeds till 6 months of age and then start rice based feeds.  3. If this is followed scrupulously - the baby will stop having diarrhoea in another 3-4 days and then start gaining weight too.4. If you feel your feeds alone are inadequate for the baby, then Zerolac is the only option. I request you to keep me posted about the recovery of the baby and follow of the case.You can approach me at the following link.

Your black stool history most likely means that you have been suffering from peptic ulcer which was bleeding. And when a black stool appears, endoscopy should be performed at first (not colonoscopy). And if there was no proper treatment, your peptic ulcer is still there. Especially that you suffer from stomach ache and acid reflux. You should have endoscopy performed (it might be quite urgent in case of bleeding). Bright red blood in stool is probably caused by hemorrhoids, but colonoscopy should be performed to rule any more serious diseases. It might also happen (according to daily alcohol usage) that your pain is caused by pancreas or hepatic disease. That is why abdomen ultrasound should be performed and hepatic, pancreatic enzymes should be tested.

I have been taking omeprazole and esomeprazole but am still getting the symptoms. Could it be the mesh? Do you advise I go back to the gatroenteroligist or will these symptoms settle eventually. I ahve had this since november 2011","Doctor":"Hello, debrapatrick, I am glad to hear that all your blood tests and ultrasound examination Came back normal.I am not sure how long ago your hernia mesh was Placed.If there was a problem with infection, you would be much sicker with fever,swelling,redness and a high white cell count.Sometimes scar tissue or adhesions can trap nerve endings and cause pain.Also mid abdominal pain can indicate pancreas problems.Again, blood tests for pancreas, such as enzymes Amylase and Lipase levels would be elevated.H.pylori has been treated successfully, which is good. I would recommend continueing once a day Omeprazole-20 mg. for 2-4 weeks. Wish you well."},{"Patient":"hello My baby is 6 months old..we dont get drinking water.so we ger mineral water cans .i have read it is not safe to give mineral water to babies..can we give aquaguard or pureit filter water.which is better.i want to give her dal water..plz suggest..Thank you","Doctor":"Hello, Welcome to HCM.I understand your concern.Pureit is mostly RO+UV water filter while aquaguard is only UV filter. It is better to give pureit purified water as it will remove all bacteria & virus and excess of mineral while preserving minimum required quantity of mineral that is useful to body.Only RO purified water may remove excess of minerals leading to deficiency of certain mineral that are obtained by water. So, it should be second choice.Only aquaguard purified water will remove all bacteria with most viruses but will not remove mineral, thereby leading to high mineral intake if ground water is used. So, it should be 3rd choice.Hope this will be helpful.Thanks for using HCM.Do ask if any further question is there. Take care."},{"Patient":"Hi, My baby(Girl) is 4 month old, she is suffering from cough. No running nose/maces.

The severity of condition depends on size of pulmonary artery. Pulmonary artery is the artery supplying blood to lung for oxygenation of deoxygenated blood. In pulmonary atresia the size is very small, so in early life a shunt is made distal to the obstruction for some oxygenation. Increase blood supply also helps in growth of pulmonary artery.Later another operation is done which is known as total correction.Multistage surgery may be needed depending on the size of chambers.

I weigh may be 165lbs at 5 2 . I wonder if I possibly have either a stomach ulcer , in the process of one, a parasite/bacterium or may be none if these. I have had tightness and heaviness that I recognize, occasional burning sensations that have spread directly from this 3-4inch area below the edge of my left breast to my back in a 3inch line., seemingly bloated a bit but it s not always after eating and it s not as often as when it flares up at night and peaks usually 3-5am as. This episode has been going on for at least two weeks now. I ve had muscle spasms lower back and in this area but I can t decipher the frequency :(. This has been going off and on since around march of this year or may be earlier this year, I think. I remember when I went for an appointment a few weeks I believe after I noticed for the first time and she thought I had a benign cyst on my spleen from just pressing on and around the area?! When I had the ultrasound the lady never mentioned the area of concern at all on the end results. Could this even be an allergic reaction? I do take the 24hr non drowsy allegra 180mg of fexofenadine HCI one per day since early march.","Doctor":"Hello,itachiwbb969, First of all , let me assure you that an incidental finding of a small cyst of the spleen is not of concern and your symptoms are not from that. Burning sensation and also pain occuring at nights do suggest acid problems. I am not sure if you have had any X-ray or endoscopic studies of your stomach. I am sure  that they have ruled out gallstones after the ultrasound examination. Allergy medications very rarely cause gastrointestinal side effects such as nausea, not severe abdominal pain. If you have done any travel outside of US, like Mexico or Far East, a stool examination for parasites is a good idea.

Doctor put him on antibiotics for 10 days and may refer us to a surgeon if this does not go. I am very worried about the possibility of it being a tumor.","Doctor":"Hello. I just read through your question.What you are describing is consistent with an abscess. The location is very common for this type of thing. An abscess is a bacterial infection of the skin.

Most likely you are suffering from peptic ulcer. If your pain is related with meals intake, and a chest pain is like burning this might be it. However, when chest pain appears, it is always necessary to rule out any heart diseases like ischaemic heart disease as a heart attack may come up with similar symptoms. At least ECG should be performed and other heart tests if necessary. If it\`s about peptic ulcer, treatment can be started only after gastroduodenoscopy (it is necessary to rule out any malignant tumors, and check if there is Helicobacter Pylori infection). If your gastric mucosa is infected by this bacteria, antibiotics treatment associated with H2 blockers treatment is necessary. If gastroduodenoscopy will show nothing, it is possible that you are suffering from gall stones and ultrasound of abdomen is necessary. Hepatic and pancreas tests should be performed as well. Take care"},{"Patient":"Hi Doctor ,My baby was born on 28th November 2013 . On 12th , he was crying and he had fever of 101 F . we did not know know and by the time we reached hospital his fever has increased to 102.5 F . On reaching hospital he was given Crocin and with imeediate sponging his fever subsided and he did not have fever after that . However Doctor asked us to admin him to check if he had infection . They did urine culture , blood culture etc . urine culture showed he had some UTI infection . Initially he was given ampicilling and zentalycin . After urine culture was positive he was given Amikacyn ( once per day) and zosyn( three times per day ) for one week via canula . Now he has been asked to give Clamp(amoxicillin) 1.5ml/day for next thirty days . After that doc has ashed us to DTPA for baby .However with these antibiotics baby is passing continuous stool in small quantities somtime more than one hour continuously .

We feel crying after seeing all this .REgards A","Doctor":"Hi, thanks for writing to us.Usually after taking amoxicillin one generally get loose stools due to the medicine effect. However your doctor has prescribed enterogermina to reduce loose stools so continue it. But store enetrogermina in fridge for maximum efficacy.The kid may be crying because continuous loose stools may have caused inflamation of  the skin around the anus , so go  back to your doctor and get some soothing ointments to be prescribed.Thank you, regards."},{"Patient":"My 7 year old daughter had her tonsils and adenoids removed about 18 months ago; since then every time she gets a touch of the cold she suffers bad nose bleeds- usually between 3& 6 bleeds over the couple of days she has the cold. Is this usual after this procedure? She never had nose bleeds prior to surgery.","Doctor":"Hello. I just read though your question.This is not a typical complication of the procedure.    You can always try saline nose drops when a cold is coming on. This could potentially prevent the next nosebleed form happening. If the nosebleeds persist, I recommend consulting with your doctor to discuss a referral to an ENT."},{"Patient":"Hi, My daughter is 7 months old.She was born with hair on the body, but she lost all the hair on the body except for the upper lip and forehead.It kind a looks very dark on the upper lip , just like a moustache and the forehead has also little hair.I am worried more abt the hair on her upper lip.Is there anything that I can do abt it. Thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hi there! Thank you for contacting us. With what you are describing may be due to an elevation in testosterone. Even females have testosterone, and it's to a lesser amount than in the males. I would take her to the pediatrician and ask to test for testosterone levels. I hope that helps.

Is it because she was on anitbiotics febrex plus for a long time. i","Doctor":"Hi there! Thank you for contacting us. Yes, I do believe this is due to the antibiotics. It changes the normal flora (the normal bacteria, the good bacteria) in our bodies. She probably has a yeast infection and would need to be on a prescription to treat it. Sometimes we exchange one more extreme problem for a less problem. This is no long term problems with yeast infections, they are just uncomfortable and annoying. This probably won't be the only time she has one. Get her to the pediatrician and they can get you a script.

Her stomach is sore to touch. Fever down from 101.9 to 99.5 today. She s 10. hasn t had much of an appetite - no appetite today. Concerned.","Doctor":"Hi there! Thank you for contacting us. This is most likely a concussion. Even though she hit her chest on the edge of a platform, she most likely hit her head, kind of like a whiplash action. Keep a close eye on her and if she becomes confused or changes her words around, take her to the emergency room. Other than that, she should be fine after about 7-10 days."},{"Patient":"My granddaughter started putting her legs in a frog position and rubs her vulva on the floor often, esp When upset . When I tell her that is private and take her to her room she gets very upset. She started doing this around 1 and is 2 now. What should we do?","Doctor":"Hi there. Thank you for contacting us. She may be trying to scratch it because it is itchy. This is most likely caused by a yeast infection. Take a look and see if there is any white substance around the area. Also look in  her mouth for the white substance that will wipe off with your finger or a toothbrush. You probably will most likely see it on her tongue or the inside of her teeth. Take her to the pediatrician and get a prescription for the yeast infection."},{"Patient":"My daughter is 2 months away from being 12. She has a dark ring around her neck. It is not dirt. The doctor said it could be she has cyst on her ovaries or diabetes. Could she really have cyst on her ovaries at such a young age. And yes she has periods.","Doctor":"Hi there! Thank you for contacting us. If she has frequent need for drinking water or is thirsty all the time and frequent urination, I would suspect diabetes. However, there is a good chance she has a cyst on her ovaries. These cysts get larger to expell an egg. Once an egg is expelled, there shouldn't be any other side effects. If you wanted to know for sure, ask for an ultrasound or imaging of her ovaries. I hope this helps. I've have been riddled with ovarian cysts for many years. Many ruptured and are extremely painful. This all can be managed."},{"Patient":"My son wll was 2 months when he went to the er and they put n iv on his left top hand and he had it for like 4 days and when we left the hospital it looked infected where they took the iv out from. Now my son is 4 months and he has a scar but whenu touch it u can feel like a lump .what can it be","Doctor":"Hi there. Thank you for contacting us. This scar is full of scar tissue which is fibrous. That's why it feels like a lump. If it is still red, you may want to use some rose hips or scar medication that is over the counter. My twin nieces, born 9 weeks early, had an IV many weeks. They are now 16 and the scar has gotten longer but causes no problems. Often times we need to exchange one extreme problem for a lesser problem. Catching it early and trying to treat it with skin cream for scars may help since his skin is so young. I hope that helps. Thank you for contacting us."},{"Patient":"My granddaughter is 3 years old.

I am sure you do weight lifting , tread mill etc. This could certainly affect the abdominal muscles causing strain and may be even sprain. Blood in the stool after a hard bowel movement is due to small piles or Hemorrhoids (Internal or external) or may be a small tear or anal fissure. Continue to drink fluids and use an over the counter stool softener. Your pharmacist in the drug store can give you suggestions about this.

Unless the kid's having low urine output or very dull or excessively sleepy or blood in motion or green bilious vomiting...you need not worry. I suggest you use zinc supplements (Z&D drops 1ml once daily for 14 days) & ORS (Each small packet mixed in 200ml of potable water and keep giving sip by sip) as hydration is very important and crucial part of treatment. If there is vomiting you can use Syrup Ondansetron (as prescribed by your paediatrician).Regarding diet - You can use cerelac...any flavour will do. Avoid fruit juices as they might aggravate diarrhea. You can give zinc supplements & ORS apart from normal vegetarian porridges & soups.Regards - Dr. Sumanth"},{"Patient":"Hi, my baby is suffering from runny nose , cough and fever. He is 2 year old.

Pain and swelling in inguinal area (or better pain and some kind of lump) may be caused by inguinal hernia. Especially when it hurts during coughing. In inguinal area there are also lymph nodes which can be painful and enlarged when inflammation process is in this lymph nodes area. It can be located on same side leg for example. If your son is having a fever this diagnose is more probable. One more thing - by inguinal region I understand a region where an abdomen ends and a leg begins. If the pain is a little bit higher, there is a need to look for a disease in abdominal cavity. If it\`s a right side where the surgery was performed, intra abdominal adhesions are possible, and intestine partial obstruction must be ruled out. Also there is always a probability of post-operative hernia. What should be done is: blood tests for inflammation signs, ultrasound of abdomen and inguinal area and if lymph nodes will turn out enlarged, biopsy is necessary.

It means that a uterine cells are growing outside the uterine, mostly in abdominal cavity. To diagnose it mostly laparoscopy (some kind of surgery where a camera is put in to a abdominal cavity) is necessary. However, before endometriosis is suspected, other abdominal cavity diseases must be ruled out. To do that abdomen ultrasound or even abdominal CT needs to be performed. If this will show nothing, and blood tests, urine tests are negative, laparoscopy is necessary. There can be other reason of your pain - dry vagina. You can try some lubricants. Vaginal infection should be ruled out as well. You should see your gynecologist for examination and intra vaginal ultrasound.

Is this something I should get checked out or am I over reacting?

I called a ambulance to transport her . Along with collapsing, she also vomited. She was diagnosed with strep throat the night before and was put on a antibiotic. She was running a fever of a 101. When we got to the hospital they said that she was severely dehydrated and they gave her if fluids. However, they did a ECG on her and the doctor told me that the ECG was abnormal. This what the ECG copy said sinus tachycardia. Possible left atrial enlargement. Septal infarct. T wave abnormality, consider inferior ischemia. T wave abnormality, consider anterolateral. They released her said to follow up with a pediatric cardiologist. However, the appt is not until Aug 22nd. But I am a little panicked that this needs to be checked out right away. If we should take her to children s hospital tonight","Doctor":"Hi...I understand your concern. I have gone through the details just now. This seems like an inferior wall infarct to me as she had collapsed and it could probably be due to low Blood pressure. I suggest that she needs evaluation immediately. She will need an echocardiogram to see the ejection fraction and also an ECG again (possibly treadmill too after evaluation). I suggest you see a pediatric cardiologist immediately.Regards - Dr. Sumanth"},{"Patient":"Hello dr, I am having twins who are turning to be 4 months they were born 2.3 kg & I gave them NAn 1 formula since the day they were born with very little breast feeding till now, however the issue is that my babies keep crying all day despite they grow on it & I burp them well after each feed but also they can burp after the feed by 2 hours & sometimes they vomit I want to change the formula any suggestions I know that Bebelac is okay shall I switch the milk or what shall I do.","Doctor":"HIWell come to HCMI really appreciate your concern in my opinion this could be due to crying tendency of the babies and this kind of crying phenomenon commonly noted in twins and this is nothing to worry and may not be due to feeding given to them still changing the formula is okay, take care."},{"Patient":"For the past 6 years or so, my now 11 year old daughter occasionally has an incessant cough for days or weeks without relief.

Pls. enlighten us about FNAC and what the implications of her medical problem are and what possible treatment is available in India.","Doctor":"Hello! Your symptoms are characteristic for partial renal or ureter obstruction (described as hydronephrosis). This state may be caused by kidney stones (what is quite often), kidney/ ureter tumor, ureter narrowing, ureter compressions from outside (something inside abdomen cavity). Your ultrasound shows a lobulated complex what should not be neglected (hypoecholic SOL - space occupied lesion is just a cyst, what is very often and not significant in that case). FNAC means fine-needle aspiration cytology. It is a very good idea to rule a cancer out. This procedure looks like a regular injection where a sample of cells is being aspirated and can be exterminated under a microscope. It is very important for you to find what is wrong with your kidney, as hydronephrosis is a pathological process which destroys your kidney.

Your symptoms may be caused not by a abdominal disease but by a backbone disease. If there is a spinal cord constriction pain appears, and its localization is dependent of the sick backbone region.

According to all tests you have mentioned, there is no small intestine examination. That is why CT Enteroclysis might be necessary to rule out any small intestine disease.

Keep hands clean and nails trimmed. Clothing that covers fingers with mitten may help if available.Make that you monitor the condition and show your pediatrician at your scheduled visits.

Tahir Wani YYYY@YYYY","Doctor":"Bedwetting is a common problem in children and could last upto 5 years of age in about 25% of children. I understand that it is awkward but I do not think that you need to be proactive and get so many tests done. You have to gradually train the child so that bedwetting gets demotivated. Things that you could do are:* Shift times for drinking. Increase fluid intake earlier in the day and reduce it later in the day.* Schedule bathroom breaks. Get your child on a regular urination schedule (every two to three hours) and right before bedtime.* Be encouraging. Make your child feel good about progress by consistently rewarding successes.* Eliminate bladder irritants. At night, start by eliminating caffeine and if this does not work, cut citrus juices, artificial flavorings, dyes (especially red) and sweeteners.* Avoid thirst overload.* Consider if constipation is a factor. Because the rectum is right behind the bladder, difficulties with constipation can present themselves as a bladder problem, especially at night.* Do not wake your child up to urinate. Randomly waking up a child at night and asking her to urinate on demand is not the answer, either – and will only lead to more sleeplessness and frustration.* You may use a bedwetting alarm that beeps when you it feels moisture develop inside the piece of clothing the device is attached to.* Do not resort to punishment. Getting angry at your child does not help her learn. The process does not need to involve conflict.* The best non medical intervention is perhaps star charting. Award a star to your child for each dry night. Promise a small gift in case she gets a certain number of stars. Delayed gratification increases the effectivity of the method.Hope that helps. I would suggest that you get a second opinion."},{"Patient":"Hi, My son is 5 years old. He frequently (Once in every month) has cough and cold and every time doctor advise him to take antibiotics like Phenix with other cough and cold serups. Last week we came to know that with cough and cold he has also developed the uring infection and according to the culture report of the urine most of the bacteria found in the urine are resistant to the antibiotics.  Our doctor has advised us to go for another urine culture test before starting the cure for the same. Please advise me what is best for my son in this situation.","Doctor":"Fever and cough are very common ailments in children. Most often it is caused by certain viruses. Some children are more prone to catching cold but the propensity comes down with age. The treatment of fever and cough is use of plain paracetamol to reduce temperature and use of some antiallergic like cetirizine. Antibiotics are generally not required as they are ineffective against viruses. It should recover on its own in 5-7 days. Steam inhalation should be helpful in diluting the cough.Urinary tract infection (UTI) on the other hand is a primarily bacterial infection. Please note that mere presence of bacteria in urine needs to be greater than 10^5 (100000) per cubic mm for the diagnosis of UTI. If that is not the case but still bacteria are present, a second urine culture is sometimes advised. If the sensitivity report shows resistance to most antibiotics, surely there should be at least a few higher antibiotics like colistin that are still sensitive. If the sensitivity of those have not been checked, a second culture could have been advised. The best treatment for your son would be to administer proper antibiotics as per your doctor's judgement.

Most commonly an urinary tract infection (UTI) is associated with such a condition, especially when there is fever associated. The treatment of UTI can be done with appropriate antibiotics like ofloxacin.Other than UTI, conditions like glomerulonephritis and certain nephropathies could also be present but I do not think that you need to worry about these.

According to your friends surgery history there is a probability of post-surgery adhesions. Especially she have had two of it.  Adhesions may cause partial intestines obstruction (called subileus) which can reveal with intermittent abdominal pain. If your friend has also constipations, diarrheas or both associated with abdominal pain and  flatulences, nausea and this symptoms may come and go, subileus is very probable. Lower right abdominal pain is also characteristic for appendicitis (what has to be always ruled out!), right urinary tract infections/stones. Backbone diseases can also show up with symptoms mentioned by you but (backbone MRI may be required if all abdominal diseases are ruled out). To rule out intestines obstruction abdomen X-ray is necessary (abdomen CT might not visualize it).

Most of the times it is caused by certain viruses but it does not necessarily have to be swine flu. Separate varieties of influenza affect humans and pigs. When the variety that affects pigs, affects humans, it is called swine flu. The presentation is simply cough and cold and nothing more, the symptoms that we commonly refer to as 'flu'. Let me assure you that the hype about swine flu is more because of technical reasons like genetic recombination in the influenza virus giving rise to new strains which could cause a pandemic. But such developments are extremely rare and you need not worry. In case you are apprehensive, you can get flu vaccine for your child.The treatment of fever and cough is use of plain paracetamol to reduce temperature and use of some antiallergic like cetirizine.

Although smoke could indeed be a cause of the fussiness of the child, it probably plays an independent role. It could be that formula milk itself is the cause of the fussiness. Let me emphasize on the fact that breast milk is the best possible feed for a baby and there are can be no alternatives for the same. Most formula milks are cow milk based and contain more proteins than the tender intestines can tolerate. Hence the formula milk itself could be the cause of the fussiness. I would strongly insist that you try to switch back to breast milk either in the form of breast feeding or as expressed breast milk. The production of breast milk is based on the child's demand and more the baby sucks on your breast, more would be the amount of breast milk produced."},{"Patient":"My 12 yr old son and I have a snot free cold for last week.

It will help in preventing dehydration. Usually such infections are self limiting and get corrected in around 3-5 days. But a child not feeding well could warrant the requirement to visit a doctor.

With the time as the gas gets absorbed gradually the vomiting tendency should reduce.Hope that helps."},{"Patient":"My 4 year old daughter has had a severe headache, on the top of her head she says, has been spiking fevers to 105 degrees and won t drink water, juice anything to help me reduce the fever. She does not have strep, negative test yesterday, no sore throat, runny nose or painful ears and we ve had her on alternate courses of generic tylenol and motrin which brings the fever down to 101 or 102 but up it goes again and the headache is almost always there. This had been happening since the wee hours of Wednesday morning and I don t know what else to do. Any suggestions?","Doctor":"Fever with headache could be caused by falciparum malaria or some bacterial infection affecting the nervous system (meningitis) - both of which could be serious. Although viral fevers could also present with high fever, body ache and headache, the serious conditions need to be ruled out first and I would strongly recommend that you visit a pediatrician immediately.As of now tepid sponging and tylenol will help in reducing the temperature. Meftal P is more effective than tylenol but is a prescription medicine and I would suggest that you get it prescribed by your pediatrician."},{"Patient":"good morning, my daughter has benn sick for eight days now. I will start from the begining. Thursday aftrenoon she went with a friend to eat , she had a chicken burger, she said it did not smell good (shes 13 and ate it anyway) the next morning 5am ish she started vomiting, the belly pain started twards the left side of her abdomen. she seemed ok saturday and sunday (sick and mild belly pain but not throwing up) monday she started thwowing up again now the pain is center to  right abdomen getting worse by tuesday shes in allot of pain in her right abdomen.

She has also has diariha.Thank youSheila","Doctor":"I have gone carefully through the details provided. Your child could have suffered from acute gastroenteritis caused due to pre-formed toxins in food due to bacterial contamination. But it is unlikely to last long. In any case, proper hydration with oral rehydration solution or intravenous fluids is essential to prevent dehydration. Your child needs to be properly examined for me to understand the source of the pain & the symptoms.The diagnosis of appendicitis is clinical. Investigations may not show anything. But tenderness over a certain point over right lower abdomen would indicate appendicitis. It could match the symptoms present. If that is the case, surgery is the only treatment.If gall bladder stones are evaluated to be the cause, the treatment is also surgical removal of the gall bladder.The symptoms could also be due to conditions like intestinal obstruction which needs to be treated surgically.It is no use presuming things. Taking second opinion should be a better idea as I would not be able to clinically assess your child.Hope that helps."},{"Patient":"My eight years old son suddenly got fit,while he was sleeping.This is the first time.

Children may occasionally have benign myoclonic seizures during sleep. These are usually harmless and generally subside eventually. All you have to do is to keep the child under routine medication and things would be fine. Generally the medicines can be withdrawn in a few months to years without any residual effect. So, I would summarise the condition as curable. Stay relaxed."},{"Patient":"Hi, My 12 year old son has been feeling ill for two days, he is slightly warm to touch, complains of dizziness off and on, hot and cold, headache, cough and sore throat. I have been rotating dayquil, Tylenol and Ibuprofen, he feels a little bit better. He can swallow and eat without severe pain","Doctor":"Your child could be suffering from a viral infection which could manifest with the mentioned symptoms. Usually it lasts for 5-7 days irrespective of use of antibiotics. Medications that you are giving are proper. Medicines that reduce pain (analgesics) and fever (antipyretics) are used to relieve headaches, body aches, and fever. The analgesics/antipyretics that are available OTC are aspirin, tylenol, and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) like ibuprofen. Gurgling with lukewarm water should help. You may add disprin dispersible tablets.Please be patient. The condition should soon resolve.Hope that helps."},{"Patient":"My daughter has swollen eyelids from using Benzoyl Peroxide (10%) acne cream. I ve given her Benedryl to treat this issue.

I am thinking no on the long-term but I would feel more comfortable with an educated answer.

However, the side effects could be-* drowsiness, dizziness, weakness* anxiety, feeling shaky, sleep problems* vision changes* nausea, loss of appetite, diarrhea, constipation* dry mouth, yawning* cold symptoms such as stuffy nose, sneezing, sore throat, cough* increased sweatingI do not expect long term side effects. If present, long term side effects could include: * changes in weightI would insist you not to worry, especially because she has already been taken to the ER where the doctors can take appropriate interventions if required.Hope that helps."},{"Patient":"my daughter woke up with a large red itchy spot on her cheek, it s winter where we live so i ruled out mosquito bite. she is 3 yrs old, she has another red area in her arm pit that itches. she has has the chicken pox vac. all her shots are up to date. im wondering what this could be and if there is a possibility of it being contagious, as I have a compromised immune system, i have to be very careful if its a chance of it being chicken pox i cant risk getting shingles. Or it could be a spider bite maybe? i m not sure","Doctor":"Hi,Welcome to the HCMBrief...History is incomplete,some associated symptoms need to be known to differentiate differential diagnosis.Detailed answer...As I have gone through your question,I need to know about other associated symptoms to rule out wether it can be chicken pox,measles ,eczema or low immunity.If she has 2 to 3 days back history of runny nose,flu,red eyes or fever then most probably it can be viral infection (measles),as the spots tend to be in clusters and crust gradualy in chicken pox and they appear first on abdomen, in measles spots and rashes start appearing first on face but associated with above mentioned symptoms.Since you have also mentioned about low immunity,with compromised immunity ,the child should have history of recurrent different infections or chest infections.From my point of view it seems that she is having eczema only ,which is allergic response of skin to cold weather,pollen etc .For that stop using soaps and apply amolients 3 times a day.She may also use diphenhydramine ointment 2 times a day and follow accordingly.Regards,Dr.Maheshwari"},{"Patient":"My daughter 10 year old has nausea , vomiting , mild fever.

Now it is watery and nothing stays in the body. Is there any medicine I can give for diarrhoea. What kind of food will stay.. she vomits also.","Doctor":"Symptoms related to any diarrheal illness are often associated with any infection to the gastrointestinal tract, such as high grade fever, loose motion and abdominal pain.Electral or ORS (oral rehydration solution) needs to be given as the mainstay of treatment. If the amount of ORS taken in is greater than the amount lost, dehydration will not occur. It would help in replenishing the lost salts and water. She should be well hydrated with electrolytes, along with symptomatic treatment like NSAID (acetaminophen) for fever, anti secretary drug like racecodotril to reduce the frequency of motion and also to prevent dehydration will help her. Continue Zintac and the other medicines. Give some antiemetic like ondansetron 30 mins before food. It will help in retention of the food and prevent vomiting. Any food except for milk, can be given. Curd or yogurt can however be given. No specifications about food that will stay. Just use the antiemetic and things would be fine."},{"Patient":"My 8 yr old is having a dry cough x 1 week.

Do I need to be concerned as she is still coughing and the rash.","Doctor":"Children often suffer from viral infections that manifest with cough as well as rashes. Generally it lasts for 5-10 days irrespective of the use of antibiotics which are only effective in case there is a secondary bacterial infection. Giving over the counter antiallergic like cetirizine syrup should help in reducing both the cough as well as the rashes. Giving steam inhalation should also help. Water in the form of vapour would reach deep into the lungs and help in diluting the cough. Give tylenol if the temperature is raised.Since the cough is lasting for 7 or more days, there could be reason to get concerned and I would suggest that you visit a doctor and get her examined."},{"Patient":"I ve been having pain/pressure in my abdominal area, on the left side under my ribs, and occasionally the other side, under my belly button.

Is it maybe too early? Next week will make my period late. Or is this something else? Can you help?","Doctor":"Hello! Left side abdominal pain associated with lower back pain and below belly button pain can all be caused by bladder or urinary tract/kidney infection. It is mostly associated with burning during urinating and more often urinating. Same pain can appear when there is ovarian infection, uterus infection or ovarian cyst. It can also be a sign of pregnancy or what is very dangerous ectopic pregnancy. Pregnancy test can by failed, you should repeat it after a week or so. You should have abdomen ultrasound, blood tests for infection, urine tests and visit gynecologist  for examination and ultrasound.

Occasionally she will pass a normal one and I think that everything will be OK, but then she will go back to passing liquid again. She has no tummy pain, and it does not cause any burning sensation for her as it passes. She hasn't been vomiting. She is slightly underweight for her age but I'm not sure of her exact weight at the moment. She likes milk, fruit, bread, spaghetti, cereals, vegetables, cheese and some white meat but not red meat. Her diet hasn't changed recently. I've been reading about toddler diarrhoea; will this just go by itself, and should I be giving her something to help firm the stools up again? Or take her to see the doctor? Thank you.","Doctor":"Children often suffer from toddlers diarrhoea or diarrhoea due to rotavirus. It is a self limiting condition and generally shows recovery in 5-10 days irrespective of the use of antibiotics. All you have to do is to maintain proper hydration by giving ORS (oral rehydration solution) sip by sip. Prepare it by mixing a full sachet in the designated amount of water (200 ml or 1 litre depending upon the size of sachet). I do not think that you need to give anything to firm the stools. Just avoid milk for a week and by then the consistency should improve. You can give decolic syrup for the abdominal pain.If the child becomes lethargic and the frequency of passage of urine comes down, you should consider dehydration and take the child to your doctor."},{"Patient":"A 4 1/2 year old boy.

I just read through your question.Often, when a child of this age complains of mouth pain, it's an issue with the throat. This is often associated with abdominal pain and fever indicating an infection in the throat. Sometimes this can be strep and steep must be treated with antibiotic. When it's not strep, the cause is viral and it will resolve kn it's own. So it is important to consult with your doctor to check for strep."},{"Patient":"Hi.

It is not a cause of concern. It occurs due to rapid transit of the fecal matter through the large intestines and so the bile pigments do not get the time to get converted to the yellow pigment of stool. Furthermore, passing stool 10 times a day is as normal as passing stool once in 10 days in a child of this age and both are to be considered normal so long as the child is passing adequate amount of urine. If the child passes urine more than  times in 24 hours, you need not worry. No remedial measures suggested so long as the child is active and feeding fine. Just continue breast feeding as usual."},{"Patient":"my 5 weeks old baby girl did not pass stools since 4 days today is the 4th day .....because of that due to gases in the stomach she is vomiting the milk she is fed..she is trying to pass but couldnt ...kindly let me know as i am worried that she may not put on weight.","Doctor":"Let me assure you that passing stool 10 times a day is as normal as passing stool once in 10 days in a child of this age and both are to be considered normal so long as the child is passing adequate amount of urine. If the child passes urine more than  times in 24 hours and if the stool is not hard in consistency, you need not worry. No remedial measures suggested so long as the child is active and feeding fine. Just continue breast feeding as usual. In case you are worried, you may simply increase the amount or frequency of breast feeding.About the vomiting, it could be unrelated. If formula feeds are being given instead of breast milk, that could indeed be a cause. In that case switching back to breast milk should help. Alternatively, try skipping a feed and then try again. If that does not relieve the problem, you may try giving Domstal Suspension 0.5 ml thrice daily 30mins before feeds and see if it helps. It might still be advisable to visit a pediatrician and keep the child under his follow up."},{"Patient":"A young girl age 12 has an illness that no one can identify or cure. when she was little she would burst out laughing for no reason and she could not control it and after a while she would stop laughing.

And ever since the same thing happens to her, but sometimes spit comes out of her mouth. When she is conscious again she gets a really bad head ache. Can you help her in any way?","Doctor":"What you detect to be sudden bursts of laughter could be due to sudden firing of nerve impulses from the brain to trigger the laughter like activity. The foaming during the seizures could be due to the rhythmic contraction of the respiratory muscles due to which the saliva gets mixed with the air giving rise to the froth. She needs to be under regular anticonvulsants for prolonged duration. Before deciding that which medicines are likely to work best in her case, it is necessary to get a EEG done. An MRI of the brain might also be required as a next step. Headaches are common to occur after seizures. Giving naproxen 500mg one tablet as required for headache, should help.Please visit a neurologist and get her thoroughly assessed."},{"Patient":"Hi, my 15 year old has been having an on and off fever for the past 4 days.

Development of a kid is as important as or I would say even more important than growth alone.3.

Childhood diabetes is of increasing concern in today's age and the only option to treat is to provide insulin from outside, in the form of injections. Even giving medicines that increase the insulin production, are not likely to help as the problem lies in insulin production.

On the 3rd day when we were in hospital her bilirubin came as 10 and doctors gave us phototherapy . When the Bilirubin came to 6 we got discharged. We were told to get the bilirubin check again after 2 days. We did so and the bilirubin was reported as 14. This was the 6th day and we went to the docs clinic. The doctor said that this is the peak day for bilirubin hence no need to worry . he recommended the bilirubin to be checked again after 36 hours. if it increases then admit here in hospital again. we did so and after 36 hours the bilirub was reported as 26. This was very alarming. We rushed to the hospital after we got the report and they addmitted her in emergency and gave her triple photo light . in 2 hours the bilirubin came to 22 else they were ready for a blood transfusion. Then we remained in hospital 2 more days till the bilirubin came to 8. After that it was 5.9 and we got over with Jaundice.

Should i go for it. ? they just want to be safe that the baby didnt got any hearing loss since they consider 26 bilirubin as high","Doctor":"Hi'Brief... if high billirubin level is physiological then phototherapy or blood exchange (transfusion) is best treatment.Detailed answer..There can be many causes of high billirubin level , which are treated accordingly.For example..if there is jaundice within first 24 hrs of birth ,it is almost always pathological like because of ABO incompatibility; hereditary Hb diseases or hereditary biliary sclerosis etc. If jaundice is after 24 hrs of birth , it can be because of breast milk or physiological as liver enzymes are not mature enough to metabolize etc.Well first from the history of your child , it seems that she has been suffering from physiological (normal) jaundice , which can be treated with phototherapy and exchange transfusion..But if billirubin level is above 20 it can effect brain so the sensory hearing loss and which can be permanant and non treatable, so better to be on safe side , hearing test should be done , once child is stable.Regards, Dr.Maheshwari"},{"Patient":"I am 100% sure I have ADD, and I really want to be treated for it.

But since you have begun the course of antibiotics, you should complete the full course to avoid development of antibiotic resistance.You have done the right thing by giving a mucolytic. Give some antiallergic like cetirizine along as that should relieve the allergic component that often remains associated. Giving steam inhalation should also help. Water in the form of vapour would reach deep into the lungs and help in diluting the cough."},{"Patient":"My 13 mo old daughter was diagnosed with RSV about 4 weeks ago. After 2 weeks she was not getting better (coughing, mucus, fever, vomit) so they took a chest xray and said she had walking pneumonia. They put her on an antibiotic, and an abutural inhaler. After another week she was sounding better, and her cold was gone, but she continues to vomit, at least once a day, always immediately following a meal, or after her evening bottle. She is also uncomfortable and irritable. The dr now says she has post infectious gastritis, and put her on Prilosec. She has been on for 3 days, but now the vomit looks like big (some 2 ) chunks of cottage cheese. I m assuming this is from her stomach acid and her milk from her bottles. Are we doing eveything, or the right thing?","Doctor":"RSV is a virus that frequently affects children between 6 months to 3 years of age. The treatment is with nebulisation which basically breaks the water and medicines into fine particles and delivers it deep inside the lungs. Steam inhalation at home could give her some relief if nebulisation cannot be given at home. Also give some antiallergic like cetirizine syrup. It should reduce the irritation in her throat which is the likely cause of her vomiting. You may also give some antiemetic like ondansetron half an hour before feeds. You may continue Prilosec. Otherwise you are doing the right thing.Our stomach contains acids that are meant for digestive purpose. The milk is supposed to get curdled when it comes in contact with this acid and this is normal. So, the chunks looking like cottage cheese, are not abnormal if she is vomiting out."},{"Patient":"My grandson was born 3 days ago and was diagnosed with hypospadias. His pediatrician is making him an appointment with a pediatric urologist. They just got home from the hospital today and I saw a anorectal fistula with a small amount of meconium coming out if it. It is about 1 inch above his rectum. Apparently nobody in the hospital noticed this. Should we call the pediatrician immediately or wait for his appt. Tuesday?","Doctor":"It is not uncommon for a child with some congenital anomaly to have some other congenital anomaly as well. Even if the newborn has anorectal fistula, no immediate intervention or surgery is advisable and so I think that you can wait for your appointment on Tuesday.The ultimate remedy the conditions will be surgery, or may be a series of surgeries."},{"Patient":"Hi, my son is almost 2 years old and vomited once yesterday. He s never sick and he threw up everything he ate. I only have a digital thermometer and it says he doesn t have a fever but he really looks like he has one. His face is red and blotchy and he s not eating very much. What can I do to help him?","Doctor":"Your child could be having acute gastroenteritis and his face could be red from the strain of forceful vomiting. You may need to give him some antiemetic like ondansetron syrup as required or before feeds. You would also need to give him ORS (oral rehydration solution) prepared by mixing a full sachet in the designated amount of plain water (200 ml or 1 litre) depending upon the size of the sachet.If the frequency of passage of urine comes down, it indicates dehydration and you would need to rush the child to the emergency department of a hospital with pediatric facilities."},{"Patient":"I brought my son to Al ahli this pm as he had blood spotting after urinating the last few days. The doctor who saw us pulled back his foreskin to take a look and couldnt pull it back down again. He was quite abrupt and scolded me for not pulling it back sooner which is against everything we are told in western medical advice, said the blood could have been a tear or an infection and left me with antibiotics and a very traumitised 2 year old. Well since we have come home, his penis has swelled and his foreskin is caught behind this and he fell asleep crying an hour ago. Ive been on the internet since and the term paraphimosis keeps coming up with advice to seek medical treatment immediately.","Doctor":"Phimosis or balanoprothatitis are conditions often seen in young children. Usually such a condition clears up by 3 years of age but if it does not, circumcision (excision of the foreskin) might be required. It is advisable to intermittently withdraw the foreskin from time to time since a substance called smegma gets collected below the foreskin and could be harmful if not cleaned at least periodically.Since the foreskin has been abruptly withdrawn after long, the swelling has resulted. Try manipulating the foreskin to put it back to the proper position. The swelling should come down soon, but if it does not or if the foreskin does not get released, circumcision might need to be considered even at this age. You would need to take the child to emergency department of a hospital if the foreskin remains stuck."},{"Patient":"my baby is 2 years old and is having diarrhoea since yesterday. She's gone about five times yesterday and five today. She is about 12 kgs. I've been giving her oral rehydration solution and three does of enterogermina (5ml ampoule) so far, last night, this morning and tonight, but she's again had loose motions. I'm worried because she's been admitted for typhoic once and dehydration once this year. What could I give her please?","Doctor":"It is not unusual for children to suffer from diarrhoea. But if the lost salts and water are adequately replenished with oral rehydration solution (ORS), dehydration should not occur. You can give rice water, dal water or coconut water but I think giving ORS should be the best.In case of dehydration, the frequency of passage of urine comes down. So, if the child is passing urine adequately, you need not worry. If urinary frequency comes down, you can initially try giving more ORS but it is advisable to take the child to the emergency of a hospital with paediatric facilities."},{"Patient":"My 18 month old daughter has been vomiting on and off for two months now never had a fever or any signs of sickness. I never know it s coming and she hasn t had loss of appetite or hange in mood. The doctor told Me it was just a virus before but never actually looked at her. I personally don t feel like it s just a virus she only pukes and it s at random. What could it be?","Doctor":"It is important to examine your child. Causes of vomiting could range from minor stomach bug (as your doctor has mentioned) to serious issues like intestinal obstruction. But since she is otherwise fine and has not lost appetite, I do not think that it is something serious. Still it might be worthwhile to get your child examined by a doctor and get the cause evaluated. It is no use speculating without examining or investigating the child."},{"Patient":"Hi, my 3 and a 1/2 year old brother had his ruptured appendix removed by surgery five days ago. He came back from the hospital today. After the surgery, his stomach was seriously swollen, which the doctor said was due to gas. He often felt nauseated, and even vomited, once a day after the surgery, every evening. He also complained of pain in hi stomach/ abdomen area but since he is young and very weak after the operation, he didn t exactly point where it was paining. I m really worried because the vomiting is usually a symptom of appendicitis so it should stop after the appendix is removed. Also, the doctor had said his swollen stomach would gradually reduce but it hasn t. What is wrong with him?","Doctor":"Hello! It is common that after opening abdominal cavity an intestines need some time to start work property. It is described as paralytic ileus and it is normal after any abdominal surgery. However it shouldn't last for more than few days after a surgery. Otherwise there advisable to suspect that something went wrong. Sometimes  after an appendectomy  (and any other surgery) intestines may be twisted what results with intestinal  obstruction. This is urgent situation and another surgery may be required. That is why if this symptoms are not going away, surgeon visit is advisable. It is necessary to perform abdomen X-ray which will rule it out.

Use one scoopful (using the supplied scoop) in 30 ml water. If the child does not tolerate, try giving a diluting form. Children can take some time to get used to new foods and I do not think it is something to worry about.I am not worried about the child belching. It should go away if you give food slowly. Hold the child erect for about 20 mins after feeds and things should be fine. If the belching does not go, you may give some antiemetic like ondansetron syrup and that should take care of the problem."},{"Patient":"My 6 month old is rubbing her head with her hand right behind her right ear.  She just cut 2 teeth and ears checked out okay with Doc. on Thursday.  Had conjunctivitus in right eye Thur, but has cleared up w/ drops.  Still sneezing and has a cough. Should we see the doctor again?","Doctor":"Children often catch cold which is actually caused due to a viral infection. Often it has an allergic component which manifests as sneezing or runny nose. You need to give Relent syrup (contains cetirizine and a mucolytic) to your child and that will relieve the complaints of sneezing and cough. You can also give steam inhalation. Just sit with the child in your lap and place the source of steam before you. Water vapour will be in the air and the child will automatically breathe it in. It will reach deep into the lungs and help in diluting the cough.If the child develops wheezing, becomes lethargic or does not recover in 7 days, you would need to see a doctor."},{"Patient":"I am a licensed associate counselor and my 11 year old male client has not learned to go to the bathroom on his own.

Could you please let us what should be the problem and whether my son could able to raise his hands and pump the legs like normal child ASAP.","Doctor":"I have gone through the details but would require some more information to be to able to respond to your query. The first thing to ask is whether the baby cried at birth. Often it so happens that the child does not get adequate Oxygen in the initial hours of the birth. As the brain does not have any oxygen damage, lack of oxygen could cause damage to the brain. This damage may or may not be evident in a CT Scan. Brain damage could manifest with the limitations that you mention. Alternatively, there could be some structural defects in the body of the baby which might be responsible for the same. In any case, the baby needs active stimulation in the form of physiotherapy that can be available from trained physical therapists of a hospital dealing with neurodevelopmental support of infants. I would insist that you visit such a centre and get the child evaluated and treated."},{"Patient":"HI May baby is 10 months old and she is suffering with cold from last 1 week and we have given to asthakind. My baby born with 3.0 kg weight and she is about 7 kg weight now, we thought that her weight is low. Pl suggest the correct treatment for her.","Doctor":"Children often suffer from cough and cold predominantly due to viral cause. Providing steam inhalation should help in diluting the cough. Antibiotics are not required. Some antiallergic like levocetirizine syrup may be given for a few days.Ideally the birth weight triples by 10-12 months of age. Although 7 kg is a bit low for a 3 kg birth weight child, I do not think that there is any need to panic. A single weight does not convey much information. You need to take weight at 3 months intervals and plot it on a growth chart. If the weight follows the normal pattern but is on the lower side, you need not be concerned. But in case it does not, follow up nutrients might be required. How much supplementation needs to be done, depends on the situation and you can be discussed only by your treating pediatrician. All you need to do from your side is to give semi solids in mashed form, roughly at 2 hourly intervals. Home made semi solids made from boiling rice and pulses along with vegetables and giving it after mashing it, should be fine to help your child in gaining weight."},{"Patient":"My son is 12 yrs old.

After that semisolids need to be introduce as breast milk can no longer meet the demands, although breast milk can be continued till 1 year of age or more. But please note that breast milk is produced as per the requirement of the baby. If the baby is hungry, the baby sucks more and therefore more breast milk is produced. Once you introduce external feeds, the baby is no longer hungry and hence breast milk production falls. Breast milk production has already been depressed so long and it is hard to start afresh at this point of time. Still, you may try giving Lactonic granules 1 sachet in a glass of milk twice daily to the mother and see if it makes a difference in breast milk production. It should help at least to some extent."},{"Patient":"Hi... My baby is 6 mths old... Till 3 mths i breast fed her but as i had to join my work back i started giving her Buffaloes milk as well as other solid food like Khicdi, Ragi, Fresh fruit pulp etc... is buffaloes Milk Harmful for her. please advice whether i can switch to Nan 1","Doctor":"Let me emphasize on the fact that breast milk is the best feed for a baby upto 6 months of age. Beyond that, the baby needs a mashed version of adult diet low on spices, introduced step by step. Milk becomes an optional component at this age if other sources of nutrients are included in diet. Cow or buffalo milk has high protein content and hence is difficult for a baby to digest. Most formula milks are cow milk based and although they are not directly harmful and may be given but I would prefer home made semi solids made from boiling rice and pulses along with vegetables and giving it after mashing it. You are doing the right thing by giving Khichdi, Ragi and pulp of fresh fruits. Most of these would be more nutritive than the available formula and so I would not speak in favour of formula like NAN or buffalo milk."},{"Patient":"My son was confined because of diarrhea and vomiting.

Anyways, the pain could be related to muscle sprain or a hernia (if the pain is located at the same spot). Since a colonoscopy was normal, it is unlikely to be related to an intestinal condition. Gall bladder pain does not present as pain over the right lower abdomen. You can consider an ultrasound abdomen localised to the area of pain.

I read through the details with diligence. I am sorry for what is happening. It is unfortunate that you were misdiagnosed and had to undergo a surgery. I am unsure why you are on prostap and HRT - ?endometrosis perhaps. If it's the reason, then probably the pain and the bleeding episodes might be related to this pelvic condition. Any way since the bleeding restarted, I would suggest reporting back to your gynecologist. He/she can restart birth control pills to control the bleed and subject you to further tests to locate the actual cause. Vomiting and loose stool following a meal may not be related to pelvic problem. Perhaps consulting a gastroenterologist and getting GI endoscopies can provide us with clues as to the cause. In brief, I am unable to relate your symptoms to a single clinical entity. I suspect that you could have a pelvic as well as gastrointestinal pathology. Hormone assessment such as thyroid disturbance also needs to be assessed. Hope this answers your query.

Throughout the night, the acid gets collected. This acid irritates the inner lining of the stomach. So, in the morning when your child takes in the food, the already irritated gastric wall revolts and she vomits out the contents of her breakfast. But in the process of digesting the breakfast, the gastric acid becomes utilised and such a situation does not arise till next morning. Hence she remains fine throughout the day."},{"Patient":"I have a three year old daughter with what looks like diaper rash but it looks like it could be a yeast rash.  Can I put Miconazole cream on her to help sooth the irritation.  Please help.  She wore a pullup last night to bed and it seemed like it only got worse when she woke up this morning.","Doctor":"Miconazole is an antifungal. Diaper rashes could be caused due to yeasts which are actually fungi and hence you can use miconazole to treat diaper rash. It will help in relieving the irritation but you have to keep the area dry."},{"Patient":"Hi there - very quick question. I'm going to Egypt and no doubt we (family) will get the infamous 'Egypt tummy'. Antinal (aka nifuroxazide) is apparently the thing said to be effective to cure. I have a 2yr old. Is it ok for him to have? If so, how much can I give? Is is 1 capsule twice a day? I think a capule is 200mg.... Any ideas?","Doctor":"Antinal (nifuroxazide) can be used to treat 'Egypt tummy' in children. Nifuroxazide 100 mg capsule (available) 1 such thrice daily for 5 days should be ideal for a child of 2 years of age. It can be given to a child of such an age without worrying."},{"Patient":"Hi Docotr, We just came to know that m 3 years old boy is suffering from TB , he was getting fever and his knww was getting swolen and there was some liquid in hi knee which doctor removed and send that for test from which we came to know that he is suffering from TB and said its in starting stage , i am worried how will it be cured and how much time it will take to recover any good doctor or sugestion..","Doctor":"Irrespective of the location of the infection, in case of first diagnosis of tuberculosis (TB), a treatment with Isoniazid, Pyridoxine, Rifampicin needs to be given for 6 months. Rifa-I6 Kid contains this combination and may be given. It is expected the that the infection would be controlled within the tenure of 6 months of treatment but may occasionally take some more time when another 3 months of treatment might be required with appropriate medicines. With proper treatment, TB is fully curable. Please visit any Revised National TB Control Programme (RNTCP) centre and the doctors there can treat it effectively."},{"Patient":"Hi I have a 9 month old baby and i get help with formula from WIC they only give me 7 cans of formula and sometimes i end up running out of formula like a week before i get issued out again. Are there any other formula related things i can give my child like Nido? My baby drinks Enfamil A.R.","Doctor":"Let me emphasize on the fact that breast milk is the best feed for a baby upto 6 months of age. Beyond that, the baby needs a mashed version of adult diet low on spices. Milk becomes an optional component at this age if other sources of nutrients are included in diet. Nido, Enfamil or similar products may be given but I would prefer home made semi solids made from boiling rice and pulses along with vegetables and giving it after mashing it. Most of these would be more nutritive than the available formula and so I would not speak in favour of formula foods."},{"Patient":"my 8 month old boy has started vomitting 2 weeks (approx) ago.

Inhalers are the newest management strategies for this. Albuterol's side effects include - tremor, nervousness, low potassium, high blood pressure (but this is a rare side effect) and as such Albuterol is a safe drug.

When you caught or sneeze your peritoneum is moving and it hurts when it is irritated by some inflammatory process in abdominal cavity. If you do not have any others symptoms like nausea, mild temperature rise, and higher heart rate it does not rule out appendicitis, and even observation in hospital may be required.

Passing less urine in case of diarrhea (loose motions) indicates that some dehydration is present.Maintaining hydration is the mainstay of treatment. If possible increase the amount of breast feeding if that is feasible. If that is not feasible, you need to give the child ORS prepared by mixing a pediatric sachet in 200 ml of plain water.

There are other layers as well as a layer of subcutaneous tissue which is made of fibrous tissue. This fibrous tissue looks white. If blood vessels are not ruptured, you can see this later if the upper layers of the skin are damaged or broken. Probably that is what you mean by 'white flap inside'.

Secondly, a gastrointestinal infection is more likely to be the cause of the presentation, accounting for the diarrhea, abdominal pain as well as vomiting. Usually such an infection get cleared on its own and does not need antibiotics unless associated with bloody stools.

He was having cough and cold since past 2 days but his behaviour was normal and taking proper food. Yesterday, we took him to paediatrician for check up just for safe side.

Doctor has prescribed few medicines Clamp (salt amoxicillin etc) , T-minic & Tixylix (we were giving him before) and nasal drops Nasikind-P. But after starting the medicines his condition is getting worst. He is not taking feed and throwing out whatever he is taking. His nose is still blocked and running as well, now he is not having feed, not taking proper feed because his nose is fully blocked. He vomits when he get cough (Mucous) and also having fever above 100 celcius. We are very worried please suggest something. We are finding our self culprit that Why we took him to doctor?","Doctor":"Children of this age often suffer from a viral infection. The chest is generally clear in such conditions but may often be complicated by secondary bacterial infections. In apprehension for the same, your doctor had prescribed the antibiotics although it was not essential. Since you have started giving it, you should complete the full course of 5 days. But please understand that such viral infections take 5-7 days to recover irrespective of use of antibiotics. So you would have to be patient. T-minic as well as Tixylix are cough suppressants. I would not prefer them. You should rather give some expectorant like Relent syr. which will ease the situation by diluting the cough which needs to come out. Nasikind P is right to be given for blocked nose. If not relieved, you may use Nasivion Drops (after getting it prescribed by your doctor). Steam inhalation would be helpful for your baby. Just sit with the child in your lap and with the source of steam before you. The water vapour would be in the air and the child will automatically breathe it in. It will reach deep inside and help in diluting the cough.Please be patient as the condition might not respond to antibiotics but should still resolve in 5-7 days. In case you still feel apprehensive, get him rechecked by your doctor.

What can be causing all of this?","Doctor":"Your child seems to be suffering from diarrhea which is often caused due to certain viruses like rotavirus. But 2 weeks is a long time for that to continue. It could also be caused due to malabsorption as in gluten enteropathy.Loss of water and salts from the body, if not corrected adequately, may give rise to dehydration. The increase in thirst is not a good sign. Rather, it indicates dehydration. You should rush your child to the emergency room of a hospital with pediatric facilities. Alongside, give ORS (oral rehydration solution) prepared by mixing a full sachet in the designated amount of water (200 ml or 1 litre depending on the size of the sachet)."},{"Patient":"HI MY SON IS 1.8 MONTHS HE IS NOT WELL AS LOSE MOTIONS AFFECTS HIM.

MY CHILD IS HAVING SEVERE RASHES AS HE PASS STOOLS 15 TIMES.PLZ HELP.","Doctor":"The doctor is treating it on the correct lines. Stopit contains loperamide which can reduce the frequency of loose stools. But it is a medication to be used with caution. Do not administer more than 3-4 doses. The stool frequency may continue for upto 5 days and you would have to be patient. Zenflox contains an antibiotic that needs to be continued for 5 days. The mainstay of treatment however, would be ORS (oral rehydration solution) prepared by mixing a full sachet in 1 litre of water and given sip by sip. The rashes need to be examined. Giving cetirizine syrup should however help in reducing the rashes. Green stools are due to rapid transit through the large intestines (that occurs in diarrhoea) and I would not worry about that.In case the child develops lethargy, you would have to take the child to emergency room of a hospital with pediatric facilities without delay."},{"Patient":"My 2 year old has had loose, mucusy, clay colored stools this week.

Brushing at night is very essential. You also need to teach her the right technique. The direction of movement of the brush should be gum downward.Your child could indeed be suffering from a gastrointestinal infection which may be the cause of vomiting and foul smelling stools.

Seizures/ Fits3. Watery of bloody discharge from ears and nose4. Unconsciousness5. Altered sensorium or behaviour. Without the above red flag symptoms, just feeling low energy levels points out towards Migraine and other sorts of tension headaches which are on the rise in current scenario due to excessive academic and peer stress the kids are experiencing.I have a few questions for you -1. How long has the headache been there?2. Does it occur always on forehead or keeps changing?3. Is it associated with blurring of eyes or double vision or giddiness?4. Is there any family history of migraine or single side headache?5. Is he very angry when he gets headache and does the ache get better after a good sleep?6. Does he vomit when there is headache?Kindly get back to me with the answers to above questions and also mention his weight so that I can suggest you the formulations which are good. But as of now - you can give oral Paracetamol in the dose of 15mg/kg/dose(max ceiling dose 500mg)  every 4-6th hourly.You can approach me at the following link.

Went to dr they said its a virus. Came home she napped then woke up with a fever but her hands feet and lips are a little purple. Gave her a bath and she began to shake a lot. She has stopped shaking but still has a fever over 100 with slightly purple hands deer and lips. Any idea?","Doctor":"HI...purplish discoloration and duskiness of lips occurs in high due to peripheral vasoconstriction. If the kid is active otherwise and well when the kid is not having fever, you need not worry.Usually rather than fever, what is more important is the activity of the child, in between 2 fever episodes on the same day. If the kid is active and playing around when there is no fever, it is probably viral illness and it doesn't require antibiotics at all. Once viral fever comes it will there for 4-7 days. So do not worry about duration if the kid is active.Regards - Dr. Sumanth"},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, Previously when my 2 year old son gets fits during fever at 104 F doctor treated with parasitamole alongwith fricium .now he is 4 years and getting fever of 104 F but not gets fits .should i give him fricium with parasitamole ?

She s just gotten her appetite back yesterday, and her body seems worn down, it is possible for her to have mono?","Doctor":"Hello. I just read through your question.Though it is possible to have mono, it is more likely that her body just needs a few days to regain it's strength after an illness.  If you notice continued weakness after several days, you should discuss it with your doctor. In the meantime, however, she should be allowed more time to heal."},{"Patient":"My daughter is 1.5 years old and weighs 10.5kg. She has been vomiting for last 2 days.

I have been told that the inner stitches from my appendix taken out when I was 5 yrs old have somehow mended together. I m having discomfort on this side including internittent aches in thigh and less the calf muscle and the groin on the same area. Can this influence urination because during the last few weeks I ve been feeling a slight pain, almost the feeling of pressure. Any ideas? Thanks","Doctor":"Hello! Your history of appendicitis is not significant anymore as it was 32 year ago. Your symptoms are characteristic for urine tract infections and urine tract stones. That is why the first step you should take is to have urine test performed and abdomen ultrasound. The other reason of your chronic thigh and calf pain might be a Sciatic nerve compression. So if your pain does not go away for a long time you should have MRI of your backbone performed. Hope this will help Take Care"},{"Patient":"Hi my child is 3 yrs old and We were supposed to give 2.5 ml amoxicillin 3 times in a day but my mistake the last dose I gave twice so now he has had 4 doses of the same...he has slept now, I am quite worried if he is going to be ok as I can t even give him any fluids since he is sleeping?","Doctor":"Hi..usually Amoxycillin doesn't the side effect of excessive sleep.

ER did chest X-ray, flu swab, WBC, UA, all negative, WBC only 4 pts above normal.  Diagnosed with virus, directed to go home and treat fever, he is still sick with no improvement.  Could a virus last this long?","Doctor":"It indeed seems like a viral infection and your doctor is right about it. A viral infection often lasts for 5-10 days and does not show up on the blood tests or X ray. The virus could indeed last that long and may be more. Please be patient as it may take some time for him to recover. Antibiotics are not likely to help. However, if the fever lasts for more than 7-10 days, you may visit the doctor again and get the child tested for typhoid which could be another probable cause."},{"Patient":"My 6 y/o 60 lb son swallowed approximately 3 ounces of pure, undulated bleach.

For sore hands - Paracetamol can be given in the dose of 15mg/kg/dose (Maximum ceiling dose 500mg per dose) every 4-6th hourly.If he develops diarrhea - I suggest you use zinc supplements (Z&D drops 1ml once daily for 14 days) & ORS (Each small packet mixed in 200ml of potable water and keep giving sip by sip) as hydration is very important and crucial part of treatment.Regards - Dr. Sumanth"},{"Patient":"My daughter is turning 3 years old, she has a very dry skin since she was born... Lately we have shifted our base where the climate is extremely dry & the water is boring hard water, that's adding to the problem. She constantly itches her arms, legs & sometimes the whole body. There is always a white layer on her skin.... At times she itches so harshly that red rashes come up. I had once consulted a pediatrian she recommended Citaphil. We have tried Citaphil, Venusia cream & lotion, coconut oil, olive oil, vaseline lotion, vaseline petroleum jelly, paraffin with water...& currenlty using hydramost lotion...also used teddy bear soap, citaphil soap, seba med soap...j&j products does'nt suit her at all, himalaya soap.....nothing seems to work... Also her water intake is very low...she never drink more than a sip or two at one go... Please advice....thanking you!","Doctor":"Our skin has some glands called sebaceous glands that secrete oils that make our skin oily. You must have seen that some people have oily skin while others have dry. Your daughter probably has dry skin and the oil secretion from her sebaceous glands is less. The dry weather and hard water adds to the problem, making it worse. This probably makes it look rough and the dead cell layer that is otherwise not so apparent, becomes visible as dry white scales.You need not panic. Just apply any sort of emollients and moisturizers including Cetaphil, Aloe vera lotions or hydramost lotion. I would not advocate use of soap. You may use Dove instead. You will have to coax her to drink plenty of water and fluids as that is essential. Please do not panic. You would have to just accept it as her skin type."},{"Patient":"hi,day before yesterday my baby suddenly he started crying , he cried for 2-3 mins and throw up some milk & he became normal, after 1 hour he did like that , he didn't throw-up any thing but he sounds loudly (when we burp baby he makes some sound) then he became active. To day he did like that 1 time. i can't understand his problem.... may i know what is his problem & any remedies for that .","Doctor":"Infants often swallow much air along with the milk. This causes abdominal distension which causes restlessness in the child. The child's body therefore tries to get rid of the extra content and the child throws up. Burping the baby properly is the best solution for this problem. If proper burping is done by placing the child in erect posture for around 20 mins after each feed, the air automatically comes out as burp without making the child throw up. With the release of the abdominal tension, the child feels relaxed and becomes active."},{"Patient":"Our daughter who is 9 yrs old and normally healthy has been running a temperature of 102.2 f for the past 10 days. First the walk in doc told it might be urine infection and prescribed antibiotics for 10 days. This was ruled out in the next two days by our family doc as her urine was fine but fever was still high.  Then they told us it might be flu for which we waited till another 3 days. Then as there was no other symptoms she was complaining of gum pain for which she has been on amoxicillin 250 mg and she is on that medication but still fever has not come down. Her blood test has also been taken for which there is nothing new as per our family doc.","Doctor":"Children frequently suffer from viral infections which cause no changes to be present in urine or blood tests. It is often associated with high rise of temperature as in her case. Antibiotics have no role to play in such infections. All that needs to be given in case of a viral infection is paracetamol to bring down the temperature, and some antiallergic alongwith. Her gum pain could be unrelated to the cause of her fever. But since it has already been 10 days, I would strongly insist that you get her blood tested to rule out typhoid as a possible cause. If typhoid is identified to be the cause, some different antibiotics like ofloxacin would need to be prescribed."},{"Patient":"Hello doc my 2 year 3 month old daughter got Uti followed by fever an cough.after consulting pedia we started her antibiotic course and she is relived from UTI and fever but the cough still persists and she is facing difficulty in eating is very cranky she has severe congestion I m giving her steam and also use humidifier in her room but the cough is still troubling her please suggest","Doctor":"Hi, your child needs a good bronchodilator.

Pneumococcal vaccine prevents infection from Pneumococcus and does not prevent respiratory problems due to other causes like Childhood Asthama, other respiratory infections or bronchiolitis or WALRI.

What other med is there for infant children if there already on keppra?","Doctor":"Hi, Keppra(Levetiracetam) is a good drug for seizures. If your child has seizures despite taking this drug consistently everyday, then you should consult a pediatrician. Get an imaging done again and the child will have to be started on either a different drug in form of Valproate or phenytoin. Or the dosage of Keppra will have to be increased. Keep Midazolam Nasal spray with you as it will help to abort the seizures at any time.Thanks and regards."},{"Patient":"Hello, For the past 2 months I have been experiencing period like cramping.

There are often large chunks of white mucus . I very rarely have solid stool. I am now waiting for a colonoscopy . He also suggested the possibility of appendicitis . I m starting to get worried as to why I have these pains Non-Stop. Thank you","Doctor":"Hello,ashleyelalonde, Left sided lower abdominal pain along with what appears to be non- formed stool (Diarrhea) does require further investigations. It looks like the symptoms started rather sudden and the duration is also short. Presence of mucus in the stool might suggest \\"Irritable Bowel Syndrome\\" or IBS for short. This is caused by sensitivity to contractions in the colon and also to distension of the bowel. At least you don't mention seeing blood mixed with the stool. That is a good sign although your stool has to be tested for hidden blood. Pockets in the colon or \\"Diverticulosis\\" is also quite common after certain age. If one of these pockets get inflamed then the condition is \\"Diverticulitis\\". This may be mild, moderate or severe.This is usually associated with fever, chills and also diarrhea and sometimes bleeding as well. A CT-scan would be very helpful before you have colonoscopy. Early \\"Colitis\\" , inflammation of the lining of the colon such as ulcerative colitis or Crohn's colitis should also be considered. Hope this will be helpful to you and you should discuss more with your docto.

Crocin contains paracetamol and needs to be given to control the temperature. It should also help in relieving the headache. If headache is not relieved, you may safely double the dose. Paracetamol acts as an analgesic in double the dose of that required to bring down temperature. It is a safe medicine and you need not worry. Do not do this round the clock, rather it should be as and when required. You may also give some antiallergic like levocetirizine 1 tablet once daily for 3-4 days. Steam inhalation should be helpful.

In such a case, there would be no findings in blood tests or ultrasound. When such a thing occurs, the frequent passage of stool, the smearing of the acidic stool over the perianal region and the repeated cleaning over the area creates erosions and leads to development of redness and rashes over the area around anus. You may apply Siloderm Mixi over the area, for a few days so that the area heals fast.Other than that you may give ORS (oral rehydration solution) prepared by mixing a full sachet in the designated amount of water (200 ml or 1 litre depending upon the size of the sachet) and give it sip by sip to your baby, such that the lost salt and water is replenished.

Tonsils are lymphoid organs present at the back of our throat and often get enlarged when we catch cold. It (tonsillitis) is more likely than sinusitis. Since the airway gets blocked by the enlarged tonsils, heavy and mouth breathing with snoring is commonly seen.It does not need to be treated with antibiotics. Antiallergics need to be given and your doctor has done the right thing in prescribing it. Medicines will not make it worse. Gurgling with lukewarm water should be helpful, if the child can be guided to do so.Propensity of tonsillar infections comes down with age.

I always felt hungry and would often feel that way after eating, often for hours at a time. I started to take probiotics and the discomfort has gone - as too the hunger pains. However, as part of that time I felt I often had a stitch like pain just directly below my left bottom rib, about a finger s width under the rib. That too went after I had the probiotics. I ve been feeling ok for the last week or two, however in the last day in the same place where I felt the stitch, I now have the feeling of a bruise - especially when the area is pressed. The area of soreness is only the size of a small coin, however there is no markings of a bruise or a lump. This has gradually become more sore over the last couple of days.

If you have had minor stomach issues before, it may be related to acid problems , may be aggravated by ingestion of certain foods like spicy foods, citrous or excess dairy products. Taking probiotics is O.K. That might keep your intestinal bacteria healthy. As for the pain , it is possible to have a pinched nerve in that area of the rib or even as you suspect a muscle sprain that could have happened during some physical activity. Topical pain relieving creams or gels are O.K. I would also suggest some warm water compresses using a wash cloth or a towel few times a day.

Should i be worry or take her to the er?","Doctor":"High fever with cold extremities indicates a condition called shock which may be serious and caused due to certain bacterial infections. The purple color of fingernails indicates cyanosis and is equally concerning. It is a concerning situation and you should definitely rush her to the ER and get her assessed and treated urgently."},{"Patient":"My 10 year old son has had strep throat twice within the past month or so and was treared with amoxicillon.  He also has stage 1 renal disease caused by congential hydronephrosis.  Little brother and both of us were treated this week for strep also.  My 10 year old has developed a rash that started 3 days ago..I gave him zyrtec and that seemed to work ok..tonight it seems to be everywhere..trunk, limbs, back, groin, face..treated him with benadryl with no effect..no other symptoms according to him.  Do we need to take him to the ED or just treat??","Doctor":"Children often suffer from sore throat which is commonly caused by either a bacteria called Streptococcus or a virus called Epstein Barr Virus. Gurgle with lukewarm water is the best treatment. Irrespective of the cause or treatment with antibiotics it takes 5-7 days to recover. In fact, antibiotics like amoxycillin cause rashes if it is caused due to Epstein Barr Virus. So, I would not recommend use of antibiotics. Zyrtec is an antiallergic and should be helpful. About the rashes, you first need to remove the amoxycillin and wait. Still you can visit the ED (emergency department) just to be on the safer side."},{"Patient":"my daughter is 4 in half mths old she started with a cough last week no other symptoms now she is congested in her nose and sounds like she has a lot of phlem I can hear it when she coughs and she gags because of the phlem I scheduled her an appt for Friday she is having a hard time drinking her milk as well. do you think she should be seen asap or it can wait until Friday? my concern is because she is so small.","Doctor":"Thanks for asking on HealthcareMagic.Children frequently suffer from cough which is caused due to certain viral infections. It can often be complicated with secondary bacterial infections. I would insist that you try to see a doctor ASAP rather than waiting for your appointment especially because the child is not feeding well. It would be good if you can give the child steam inhalation for the time being. Just sit with the baby in your lap and put a source of the steam before you. The water vapour will be in the air and automatically the child will breathe it in. It will help by diluting the cough/phlegm.Hope that helps."},{"Patient":"My 7mnth old has had frequent creamy yellow stool...slight fever...loss of appeitite....sleepier than normal....n irraitable...she had her 6mnth shots less than 2weeks ago...her stool is excessive to....had to completly change her n watevr she was sittin on at the time of accident.....plz help me kno wheather or not to take her to the er","Doctor":"Thanks for asking on HealthcareMagic.Sleepier than normal and loss of appetite along with fever could be indicative of some serious bacterial infection in a child. Your child could be suffering from a bacterial infection. I would strongly insist that you visit a pediatrician (rather than going to ER) and get the child evaluated. However, if the appointment is not immediate, visiting the ER may be a better idea. Treatment will depend upon the diagnosis. But you need to give paracetamol to reduce the temperature.Hope that helps."},{"Patient":"Hello .. my daughter is 11 months old and vomiting . She yesterday had fever but it went by fever go syrup..

He gets bloated, has pains on his right side, just below his ribs and in the center just below his rib cage. he gets nuasiated, and almost always throws up when this happens. it has lasted as short as one day, up to a week one time. I know that when he stresses about things, I do believe it brings it on. But i m beginning to wonder if it isn t possibly a food intolerance he s suffering from. I heard about many people having a problem with gluten, so i wondered if you could tell me what foods have gluten in them, so i can construct a diet for him to try. Thank-you for your time.","Doctor":"Hi.Thanks for your query for your fiance. Bad stomach aches, bloating, pain on right side nausea, vomiting off and on, particularly on stressed out day is more of an indication of IBS, the irritable bowel syndrome.  This is not food intolerance, but a part of the syndrome he is suffering from. I would suggest that get all the blood, urine, stool , CT scan of the abdomen and if all are negative it is IBS. Gluten free diet is worth a try, but I hope it is not only gluten but he has to stop all the foods and beverages which instigate or enhance his problems.He has to control his stress and anxiety and will help him the best."},{"Patient":"im having a pain on the upper right side of what i think is my intestine or abdomen .

Is there any family history of asthma or any other sort of allergies like skin allergy etc.?6. Is the cough always associated with fever?If your answer is yes for any of the above questions, your kid might be having viral associated wheezing or multi triggered wheezing and I suggest you meet a paediatric pulmonologist who is near your place.

She went back to the ER again last night and on her way back again to night. What can we do for her?","Doctor":"Hi...the treatment for sprained ankle is complete rest and a POP (Plaster of paris) cast or a crepe bandage keeping the ankle in the correct position of comfort. When the bandage or POP is too tight then the symptoms of blistering and cold limbs occur. I suggest you get back to an orthopedic surgeon and get the bandage loosened appropriately.Regards - DR.

After close to 2 hours on sitting on the toilet, I noticed her stool as wet, sandy and salt&pepper in color. She had eaten eggs, bacon and rice in the morning. Hot dog in the afternoon and a bite of McDonald McRib in the evening, not much of any appetite. Can please provide me any information as to what may cause her stool to be what I have just described? Thank you Allenn","Doctor":"Hi...It seems your kid is having viral diarrhoea. Once it starts it will take 5-7 days to completely get better. Unless the kid's having low urine output or very dull or excessively sleepy or blood in motion or green bilious vomiting...you need not worry. There is no need to use antibiotics unless there is blood in the motion. Antibiotics might worsen if unnecessarily used causing antibiotic associated diarrhoea.I suggest you use zinc supplements (Z&D drops 1ml once daily for 14 days) & ORS (Each small packet mixed in 200ml of potable water and keep giving sip by sip) as hydration is very important and crucial part of treatment.Regards - Dr. Sumanth"},{"Patient":"My 5 year old son fell at school this morning at school. He tripped and landed half in the sand box and half out. His hip bone landed right on the wood side of the sandbox. I received a call from his school saying that he had been walking funny and complaining of pain. When he got home from school at 4:00, he was still in a fair amount of pain. His posture is different due to favouring his soar hip. My question is should I take him to the walk in clinic, or hospital tonight, or wait and see how he feels in the morning.","Doctor":"Hi...hip injuries should never be neglected to the end arteries that are supplying the femoral head.

My 5 year old son has been having random skin symptoms that seem to occur every couple months. He is currently having them now and I am wondering if I need to take him to an allergist to be tested. The last time before this I took him to his pediatrician several times with in a week. She was convinced that it was bug bites. It started with a large welt that appeared on the tip of his ear resembling a mosquito bite. He then got more behind his ear. The next morning he had several on his back side and legs. The ones on his legs then formed water blisters. When I took him the first time they told me they were bites and sent me home. I took him back the same day because between the doctors office and home new bumps formed. She still was convinced they were bites. I had an exterminator out who cleared us of any bugs. After 2 weeks of the bumps turning to blisters, scabing over, new forming and then clearing the symptoms stopped for a few months. Just a week ago his father found a spider on his head in the car. He had 4 bites behind his ear after. One on his leg and one on his back that both formed blisters and scabbed over. Thinking maybe the doctor was right, I left them to heal. A few days later he woke with three new bumps on his back again looking like bites. They have swelled and I m sure again will form water blisters then scab over. I am just not convinced these are bug bites. My concern is he his having a reaction to some contact with something he is sensitive to or having a food reaction. I apologize if my letter is scattered, I can t seem to pin point this in anyway. Any advice is much appreciated. Thank you. Sent from Yahoo Mail on Android","Doctor":"Hi... i have just gone through your query in detail. I have two possibilities to suggest - 1. First and foremost is what your pediatrician is suggesting - Insect bite allergy.2. Epidermolysis Bullosa as you are telling that they scab while healing and it is recurrent.I suggest you consult a pediatric dermatologist and get him evaluated.Regards - Dr. Sumanth"},{"Patient":"Hi, my son was born with s lymphangioma in his next. ..right under his left ear. Up until a few months ago you could hardly notice it! He recently turned 3 and in the last few months it has grown quite large ( about the size of a small orange) Since it has gotten bigger he has been sick with colds and throat infections constantly. I want to know, is there a connection?","Doctor":"Hi....usually lymphangiomas are associated with recurrent infections but only locally due to pressure effect or impeded blood flow. A lymphangioma under the left ear (could also be a cystic hygroma) cannot be the cause for recurrent infections in the throat and upper respiratory tract. You need not correlate both. But as such the lymphangioma may need surgical excision and histophathological examination.Regards - Dr. Sumanth"},{"Patient":"My son has been diagnosed with 3mm vsd in echo, he was 6days then, paed cardiologist had put him on furosemide drops, the baby feeds very well, now he is 17days old, but continous urination since past few days bothering me very much since he i7 unable to achieve the desired weight, should i stop the furosemide drop,","Doctor":"Hi,Frucimide is a diuretic so passing more urine is naturally.As he has some cardiac problem, cardiologist advised this medicine to cut down the load on the heart.You can not stop frucemide without asking to your cardiologist.Due to diuretic weight gain is definitely hampered but at the same time un usual weight gain is also will be a sign of warning.Remain in regular follow up with your treating doctor.Ok and take care."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor , fever of 4 yr daughter of mine got down for only 1-2hr after giving paracetmol after that it again get raising to 103 , kindly help as we can t give parcetmol in less than 4 hr .

Both CT scan and X-ray may not reveal kidney stones, as it is very hard to visualize them in a urinary tract (especially in ureter).  Urine tests needs to be performed. Sometimes a pain radiating to a toe can appear when there is a spine problem (but this doesn't usually cause vomiting or abdomen pain) Treating kidney stones you should drink a lot of water, take a hot bath, be more active so the stone may be moved down and removed with urine. Some myorelaxants may be prescribed by your doctor.

Back pain connected with same side abdomen pain is mostly caused by kidney stones or urinary tract inflammation. This pain is usually associated with more often urinating, burning when urinating.

Stool color relates more to what is eaten than to any disease.Sometimes in children the gastrointestinal (GI) passage time is very rapid. Stools often come out the same color as the Kool-Aid or Jell-O that went in.The only colors we worry about are red, black (not dark green) and white.While normal stools are typically light to dark brown.Bile: Most dark green stools are caused by bile.Green stools are more common with diarrhea (rapid transit time), but also seen with formed stools.Foods: green Jell-O, grape-flavored Pedialyte (turns bright green), green fruit snacks, spinach or other leafy vegetables. Dark green stools (e.g., after eating spinach) may look black under poor lighting.Medicines: iron (e.g., in formula)HOPE THAT HELPS."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, My one year old had fever for five days and her blood test result says high wbc and high platelets count.

He has had no other symptoms today except for a complaint of a headache just at the very end of this evening. Earlier I checked his blood sugar and it was 82. In years past he has fainted 3 different times but they all were related to blood or getting shots.

I gave him tylenol. He has no other symptoms, he acts normal and doesnt complain of any pain at all. I just noticed his hands are icy cold and probably his feet too just that he wears socks to keep it warm. Its unusual for him to have a fever. This is his first time. He is 18 months old. What could be his underlying sickness?","Doctor":"Hi...hands and feet feeling cold and tummy and head feeling hot is quite common in high fever. As you  say he is acting normal otherwise, nothing to worry. But if his urine output is low or he is excessively drowsy, you need to take him to emergency room immediately.Fever of few days without any localizing signs could as well a viral illness. Usually rather than fever, what is more important is the activity of the child, in between 2 fever episodes on the same day. If the kid is active and playing around when there is no fever, it is probably viral illness and it doesn't require antibiotics at all. Once viral fever comes it will there for 4-7 days. So do not worry about duration if the kid is active.Paracetamol can be given in the dose of 15mg/kg/dose (Maximum ceiling dose 500mg per dose) every 4-6th hourly that too only if fever is more than 100F. I suggest not using combination medicines for fever, especially with Paracetamol.Regards - Dr. Sumanth"},{"Patient":"I just noticed a small lump or nodule of the back of my sons head like at the bottom of where the hair ends.

The swellings you are palpating are just enlarged lymph nodes and in the area you are mentioneng the most common reason for them to get are seborrhea/ dandruff or small injury to the scalp.

Are there any other tests you would recommend.","Doctor":"Hello! Your young age, lost of weight, abdomen pain and joint pain might be explained by Crohn\`s disease (but it doesn't have to be it). The best way to rule it out is colonoscopy. If it will not show the reason of your symptoms, CT of small intestine might be necessary as colonoscopy visualizes large intestine only. Only when this test are done, IBS might be recognized. The other option to explain your symptoms is an inflammation of the prostate gland. There should be any signs of inflammation in your blood tests and urine tests. You should visit urologist for physical examination of your prostate if this is suspected.

She said use hydrocortisone but in limited amts. That helped for awhile but doesn t seem to be effective anymore. The 3rd pediatrician said it was perioral dermatitis from having her hands in her mouth but said to use some type of barrier to seal out wetness.

Unusually babies grow out of this sort of allergy by 1 year of age. My suggestions for you - 1. Mother should go off cow's milk protein completely. This means that you should avoid consumption of anything and everything related to cow's milk - like - milk/ curds/ ghee/ butter milk/ chocolates/ biscuits/ ice creams etc. Even while buying commercial food products, you need to see the ingredients and if they contain milk - do not consume them.2. Feed you baby only exclusive breast feeds till 6 months of age and then start rice based feeds.  3. If this is followed scrupulously - the baby will stop having diarrhoea in another 3-4 days and then start gaining weight too.4. If you feel your feeds alone are inadequate for the baby, then Zerolac is the only option. I request you to keep me posted about the recovery of the baby and follow of the case.I wish your kid a speedy recovery.

Migraine is associated with unilateral pain(hemicrania), nausea and vomiting, photophobia and phonophobia and can be relieved with sleep. But to diagnose it as Migraine, their should be atleast 5 such episodes in a month each lasting for atleast 1 hour. So such an episode can be due to stress related, lack of sleep, or poor eue sight or raised intracranial tension. As of now, get a vision testing for your child if the episode bothers him again and get a BP check.

Sugar in the urine is usually checked only as a back-up to checking blood sugar, or to screen other family members. A urine check showing no sugar means that when the urine was made the blood sugar level was below the renal (kidney) threshold (about 8.0 to 12.0 mmol/L, or 145 to 220 mg/dL).

Also, the eyelid could be irritated called blepharitis.Hay fever is caused by an allergy to pollen.Pollen is the name given to the fine powder that is produced by plants, trees or flowers to fertilise other plants, trees or flowers of the same speciesLikely your child have Allergic pinkeye symptoms, that should improve once the allergen source is removed and the allergy itself is treated. Cold compresses or warm compresses (whichever feels best) can be used. If an allergy is the problem, a cool compress may feel better.Warm, moist compresses can spread infection from one eye to the other. Use a different compress for each eye, and use a clean compress for each application.Avoid the cause of the allergy, if possible. For example, if you have seasonal conjunctivitis then during the hay fever season try to avoid pollen by staying indoors as much as possible. Close windows and by wear wrap-around sunglasses when out.For pinkeye related to allergies, antihistamines, such as loratadine (Claritin) or cetirizine (Zyrtec), may help relieve your child's symptoms. Don't give antihistamines to your child unless you've checked with the doctor first.MEDICINES:Antihistamine nasal spray.Antihistamine tablets (or liquid medicines).Steroid nasal sprays and drops.Antihistamine eye drops work quickly.Mast cell stabilisers are another type of eye drop."},{"Patient":"My bestie Louise is 11 years old, 160 cm (5 3) tall, and 164-180 pounds ( 70-80 Kg ) , and she is in the obese percentile when i checked on internet...

If they show curiosity about a hobby, area of study, sport, or instrument, encourage and support them in any way your finances allow.Play game books.Read audiobooks on CD or MP3.Expose your child to a wide variety of experiences including music, plays, sports, museums, travel, reading, dance, games, food, puzzles, ethnic activities, etc.Play \\"thinking games\\" with your kids.Scrabble and chess are examples.Leave interesting books and materials lying around for your child to explore.Role play.

Anti-inflammatory medications, physical therapy, or other treatments tailored for patients may be necessary.Preparation and recognition of warning signs can help prevent or reduce the severity of heel pain.Supportive shoes are a must, but it’s not always obvious when to switch shoes or adapt them for the best fit. Consider these guidelines:• Use inserts to raise the heel, especially in flat-footed cleats• Discard shoes that caused pain.  Don’t use them for another sport• Wear well-constructed shoes designed for specific sports• Switch cleats often because they are not supportive shoes.Don’t skip warm-up or cool-down exercises.HOPE THAT HELPS."},{"Patient":"Good morning ...

Let me reassure that greenish stools are normal in children of this age. It occurs due to rapid transit of fecal matter through the large intestine and the bile does not get time to change to yellow colour pigment of stool. 6 months is the right time to start semi solids. You have done the right thing by starting ragi and banana. You can give any type of adult food in mashed form and low on spices. Introduce items one at a time.One possible reason for green stools is that your baby is getting too much foremilk and not enough hindmilk which often occurs when breast milk production comes down. The hindmilk provides most of the calories your baby needs, and makes him feel full. If breast milk is inadequate, no need to give formula milk; you can directly switch to semi solids.You can introduce:CEREALS & GRAINS: Rice-Barely-OatFRUITS: Apricots,Apples,Mangoes,Bananas  that you have mentioned Peas,Peaches,Pumpkin,Plums,Prunes.VEGETABLES: Sweet Potatoes,Acron/ButternutPeas,Green beans,Yellow squash.DAIRY: Plain whole milk yogurt.Hope that helps."},{"Patient":"my 22 month old son has what we thought to be a diaper rash under his scrotum and inner thighs but it appears not to be. he is constantly itching it and doesn t seemed bothered by us cleaning him on a diaper change, but wants to scratch it. what is it and what can I put on it? cornstarch powder isn t doing the trick. they are red blotches and appearing to get worse.","Doctor":"Hello.

As the kids grow their interest in food decreases and interest in play activities increases so that they eat small quantity and run away to play. As parents we need to be more patient and feed than less quantity but more aliquots per day.4. This age rather than the quantity of the food I suggest you concentrate more on the number of times you feed her and also make whatever you feed her calorie dense by adding good amount of ghee to it.5. I suggest you not to use appetite stimulants on long run as they may cause drowsiness.Regards - Dr. Sumanth"},{"Patient":"Hi i am dhawal bhasin from bangalore,india. from last 10 months i am suffering from stomach problems. i had an barium meal test on 8 feb 2012 and the doctor has found that there is swelling in small intestine . i have been taking medicines rimactazid 450/300 mg, veloz -d , combutol 800 from last 4 months . but i feel that the problem still exists and i am not totally cured. please guide me further","Doctor":"HI, YOU ARE RECEIVING ANT TUBERCULAR MEDICINES.

I think your kid is having habitual constipation. I have certain questions and suggestions for you.Questions:1. Did your kid pass motion or meconium on day one of life?2. Since how long is the kid constipated?3. Does the kid have any bleeding along with hard stools?4. How much milk does the kid consume per day?5. Does the kid eat fruits and vegetables (fibre diet) appropriately?Suggestions:1. Natural methods are the best to relieve constipation.2. Constipation is a risk factor for UTI3. Maximum milk consumption per day should not exceed 300-400ml4. Minimum 3-4 cups of fruits and vegetables to be consumed per day5.

This in turn leads to disrupted and poor sleep.Having a cold or flu can cause increased snoring.Diagnosis:Your pediatrician will examine your child to see if she has enlarged tonsils.If the tonsils are very large, the pediatrician might refer you to ENT specialist."},{"Patient":"My daughter 4years old, fell at school on the playground.

She is not running a fever and acting fairly normal.","Doctor":"Hello.  I just read through your question.Croup is a very common childhood viral illness that usually resolves on it's own . Sometimes it is accompanied by wheezing. When this happens, your doctor may choose to treat the wheezing with medication. I recommend consulting with your doctor so that the lungs can be examined and treatment, if warranted, may be prescribed."},{"Patient":"My 6 YO grandaughter woke around four w vomiting and pain.

Eveything was normal except mild problem in EEG. He prescribed some syrups, we have been using.To take a second openion we had consulted a Paediatric neuro physician again we have gone through all the test including Lumber puncture. Everything is normal, problem has detected in EEG. Eptoin syrup was using earlier, now the doctor has said to stop it immediately. Is there any problem stopping it? Now we are using Levipill,Encorate syrups and Sizodon 0.5mg, Meloset 3mg and revitrol tablets. could u plz advice us.","Doctor":"Hi, unprovoked seizures are very common entity in children. Many times no cause is founf for the seizures. In your case, the EEG shows some abnormal activity suggestive of some neurological abnormality. Syrup Eptoin(phenytoin) is a good drug for control of seizures but is found to have a role in Generalized seizures. Also it has a number of long term serious side effects like Megaloblastic anemia. Going by what your child is currently taking, appears that your child has partial or myoclonic epilepsy or a syndromic disease. Syurp encorate(valproate), Levipil( Leveretacetam), Sizodon(Risperidone) are all good drugs with less side effects and good coverage for seizures. I suggest you continue with these drugs as these antiepileptics are stopped once the child is seizure free atleast 6 months-2 years.Thanks and regards."},{"Patient":"Hi my 15 month old has just recovered from a stomach bug but still has diarrhea a week later, i have noticed today that when she drinks her stomach bubbles, she shows no sign of pain or discomfort but it sounds really uncomfortable?

In diarrhoea, bowel activity and bowel sounds both increases. Give yor child zinc supplementation in form of Syrup Zincolife 5 ml once a day for 14 days. If you have given a course of antibiotic, then dont give it further. Otherwise, Give her syrup Oflox-OZ for 5 days. Take care to provide her with adequate electrolytes through ORS powder.

The child will require a full neurological examination to look for focal deficit and a good history of the type of headache, associated aura, familial or not, unilateral or over full cranium, duration, aggravating factors, relieving factors. Get a n eurologist opinion and get an EEG, Xray of sinuses, BP, Fundus examination for raised intracranial tension. A neuroimaging of brain in form of CECT or MRI brain might be required later.

I recommend consulting with your doctor about this option."},{"Patient":"I ve been experiencing bouts of severe abdominal pain over the past 7 months and admitted to the hospital four times. I ve been given different diagnoses of diverticulitis , irritable bowel , typhlitis and colities. The pain initially presented on my right side and also intermittently included back pain. The stomach pain on a scale of 1-10 is usually 7-8. I ve had an ultrasound, a abdominal CT scan with and without contrast, an EGD, a HIDA scan and most recently a colonoscopy and I m scheduled for a CT scan with and without contrast with a pancreatic window. My History: 49 year old African American female, 5 2 , 220lbs (lost 30 pounds in the last 6 months). I currently take cardizem cd 120mg, losartan 50mg, ferrous sulfate 325 twice a day, protonix 40mg, singulair at night and just finished 500mg of levoquin after my last hospital stay July 21-23. I had H Pylori back in 1989, had my gall bladder removed in 2006, had ovarian masses/tumors removed in 2008 along with a complete historectomy. I also have a mass and cysts on my right kidney (which I was informed was perfectly harmless--been there since 2008). My last 2 hospital stays were because of hypertension, heart palpitations, tightness in my chest, headaches, sweats, pains in the left arm, lightheaded/dizziness. Tests showed a normal EKG, but some tachycardia. The EGD showed a hiatal hernia and a growth that was sent out for a biopsy. Lab reports showed among other things, anemia. The ct scan showed typhlitis , whatever that is. The colonoscopy showed stenotic ileocecal valve. The doctors have come to a concensus...they don t know what it is. Here are the majority of the pieces of the puzzle, any light you can shed would be greatly appreciated.","Doctor":"Hi MEVANS, Welcome to healthcare magic! Your problem is really very complex. So many possible causes are there. Two of your medicines need to be switched, Singulair needs to be stoped you can take other inhalations anti-asthmatic which are equally effective, You are taking excessive doses of iron- I would suggest 100mg thrice a day after meals, which is most tolerated dose. You might have post-surgical bands which result in intermittent obstruction and pain, that is more so a case if you are totally well in between the episodes. Another prominent possibilities is tuberculosis of abdomen. If your problem does not get resolved soon please review with your gastro-surgeon and possibly you would need an exploratory laparotomy for a diagnosis and intraoperative intervention if possible. You need a physical examination by your physician and get base line investigations like Chest X Ray, Electrocardiogram, Complete Blood Counts, Renal Function Test, Liver Function Test, Fasting and Post-Prandial Blood Sugar, Thyroid Profile, Lipid Profile, Ultrasound Abdomen, Urine Compete Examination. This work up is expected to detect the underlying problem so a definite treatment could be started. I hope this advise would be helpful for you. Still if you have any queries or doubts, please write me back, I would be happy to solve them. Wish you a great health!"},{"Patient":"What does it mean when a doctor finds a hole in a premature baby s stomachthey took my baby that was born premature to children hospital to day.said they tryed to feed her and she throw up.

Since your child is preterm, he is very prone to infections and perforation of stomach or intestine. This condition is closely related to Necrotizing Enterocolitis(NEC).

Although around 90% children learn bladder control by 5 years of age, but some learn it by 10 years. We usually dont treat until the child has attained >10 yrs of age and is still bed wetting. Yes, if your child has day time incontinence also, then the cause for it should be found. Get a urine routine microscopy and culture for the child along with a hemogram. Also get an Ultrasound abdomen and KUB to rule out any tract abnormality. Get a Spine examination and if possible, get a MRI spine and brain to rule out any neurological condition. Drugs are pf little help in this condition but DDAVP 0.1 mg intranasal spray and imipramine tablets are given.

Looking at it again the tip of his penis is all swollen and the puncture marks had green heads on them . I was just wondering what was the best way to go about treating this or if we need to seek medical help ?","Doctor":"Hi...this is insect bite allergy and ant bites have formic acid in it to aggravate the situation.

By what you quote I feel that it could be an eczema which has started all this. The trick of the management is keeping the skin moist and never allowing it to be dry. For this oil massage and lotions like Oilatum will help. Regarding cure options - eczema is a sort of allergy...allergies can only be controlled and can never be cured.

You can continue whatever you have been feeding her regularly. But do remember that the appetite might be down and do not force feed her.2. Fever of few days without any localizing signs could as well a viral illness. Usually rather than fever, what is more important is the activity of the child, in between 2 fever episodes on the same day. If the kid is active and playing around when there is no fever, it is probably viral illness and it doesn't require antibiotics at all. Once viral fever comes it will there for 4-7 days. So do not worry about duration if the kid is active.Regards - Dr. Sumanth"},{"Patient":"Hello yea my son is 3 and woke up complaining of TV light hurt his eyes, temperature 38.5 and had ear hurting early today he also has red tonsils and hurts to swallow he has had Nurofen and lights on now and his still gas temp of 38.3 seems of but Offliously worried of menagitis coz of light so your advice would be great :) thank you.","Doctor":"Hi...you are right in guessing that TV light hurting could be photophobia which is a sign of meningitis. But it will be consistent and along with it  there will be fever, incessant vomiting and altered sensorium, neck stiffness etc. It could as well be simple viral illness too. Usually rather than fever, what is more important is the activity of the child, in between 2 fever episodes on the same day.

In this as the kid will not be able to coordinate between the swallowing and breathing - this aversion is the nature's way of protecting the airway form aspiration.

If your child is dehydrated. 2. Stool with blood 3. Stool with mucus (White sticky discharge) 4. High grade fever. I would advice: Keep your baby hydrated, most important condition. Is your baby fully breastfed? If yes continue breast feeding in increased frequency. No other fluids essential if urine frequency normalises. If not exclusively breast fed:1.Give plenty of water(1/2 liter water+ 4 tsf sugar+ 1/2 tsf salt) Or ORS 2.Apple juice, Tea, Pomegranate juice, Coconut water, lemon water Butter milk, Rice etc 3.

But to be able to comment whether the dose/amount provided is appropriate for your child, I would need to know the body weight of your child, as the dose is calculated according to the body weight. I would suggest you to continue the medication along with steam inhalation which would provide relief. Your doctor must have made the calculations before prescribing the medicine."},{"Patient":"my 11 year old son mentioned during dinner tonight that he still gets a fainting feeling when he pees - and that it is now happening throughout his pee ( not just at the end or at the beginning). Could this be caused by dehydration.....he doesn t drink much ....or is this something he should go to his doctor to have test done...?","Doctor":"Hi, your explaination of the problem is suggestive of Vasovagal syncope in the form of Micturation syncope.It is not so uncommon problem seen in some adolescenst and more commonly in adults. This could be due to neuronal excitation which is triggered by urination. Or it could be due to any underlying cardiac disease like a structural heart disease or any arterial block. So, get an ECG and Echocardiography with doppler of large vessels done to rule out any abnormality. Usually, a CT scan head is also prescribed to rule out brain disorder. These syncopes are sometimes are preceded by some auras in form of lightheadedness, nausea, black out or headache. When these appear, the child can abort this attack by clenching of fist, grinding of teeth, tightening of thigh muscles. and after every episode, some amount of sleep should be given.Thanks and regards."},{"Patient":"My 4 year old daughter had fever, cold and cough.

She has fecer every 12 hours for which you should give syrup crocin. Give her syrup Ambrolite-S if she has cough with sputum. Also start the child on some antibiotic in form of syrup Augmentin 3 to 4 ml thrice a day for 5 days. Pain in the ear may be due to Throat infection causing ASOM. Give her Ibugesic ear drops for temporary relief. Epigastric pain may be due to gastritis caused by medications.

If the preparation of sinarest that you have , is different from Sinarest P, then it is required to give paracetamol with it. Dont give your child Amoxycillin as of now.

Now he has bilateral pleural effusion. This condtion is a bit worrying because effusion could be due to the inability of heart to completely pump the blood out.

This is because some babies in the eagerness to drink milk, gulp in air too while feeding fast and this air has to come out as belching or burping or flatus. Till it comes out, there will be mild discomfort and this is the reason why the babies cry.I usually do not recommend any anticolic medicines as the relief is only temporary and the drug effect will halt the intestinal movements temporarily which is not good.Regards - Dr. Sumanth"},{"Patient":"My 4year old daughter has inflammation in her colon area and we were told that she has Crohn s disease.

I just read through your question.I understand your frustration with the feeding of your baby. I want to reassure you, however, that the weight that you report is not abnormal. We expect babies to double their birth weight in the first four to five months of life. The numbers you report indicate that your baby's birth weight has doubled. Typically, we recommend beginning baby foods at this time in a baby's life. Adding baby foods can potentially have a positive effect on your baby's weight. I recommend consulting with your doctor about your baby's diet. However, I again reassure you that the weights that you report are normal."},{"Patient":"I have a two year old daughter that has had a clear runny nose for about a week.

Typically viral illness is last 7 to 10 days before resolving. In this age group they can last a bit longer precisely because children of this age can't effectively blow their nose or cough up the mucus. However, regardless of the above, symptoms that persist for a week or more should be checked out by a doctor.

Initially infants do not accept salty foods but on repeated feeding for few days they usually develop taste. As far as your concern let him take your feed as much as he wants ... instead o giving him formula milk, feed him with above mentioned food stuffs along with finger foods, mashed potatoes, etc  m sure he will develop taste and start gaining weight, also there would be no signs of iron deficiency as seen in only milk fed babies."},{"Patient":"Hi I have a 15 month old daughter and I noticed that her privates are a little different , I noticed about a week ago that her opening (vagina ) seems to look more open ?!

Medicine for Ear Infections To ease the pain of an ear infection, your doctor may recommend a pain reliever, typically acetaminophen or ibuprofen, which also helps reduce a fever. Aspirin should be avoided in children because of the threat of Reye's syndrome. Pain can also be reduced by using gentle heat from a heating pad, but be very careful when using heating pads with children.The drops can be thick.

For eczema, treatment is usually topical corticosteroids when she has eczema symptoms. The procedure of applying them is also perfect, to be applied immediately after bathing.2. I would like to add that please continue them at least until after a week of cure of eczema symptoms. 3. I would also suggest her to apply moisturizing lotion immediately after bathing once treatment is complete. This will improve dryness of her skin and improve itching.4. If is eczema is recurrent, I would suggest her allergy testing for common food allergens like milk, peanut, egg, wheat, soy, sea food and air borne allergens like house dust mites, mold, etc.This will help you identify the allergens causing eczema to her.5. For symptom relief of itching, I would suggest her to take an antihistamine like hydroxyzine before going to bed,Hope above suggestions will be helpful to her.Should you have any further query, please feel free to ask at HCM.Wish her the best of the health ahead.Thank you & Regards."},{"Patient":"My daughter is 22month old.

Common cause of snoring at this age is nose obstruction or obstruction somewhere in upper respiratory airway.2.If she has repeated cough-colds, I would think of nose obstruction due to long standing allergic rhinitis and would prescribe him combination of levocetirizine and montelukast. In that case, I would also suggest allergy testing.3. However, if she does not have repeated cough-colds, I would first suggest her to get examined by an ENT specialist who will examine her nose passages from inside (if necessary) and would identify the cause of snoring.4. As her sleep is disturbed due to snoring, it is suggestive of obstructive sleep apnea and hence should be evaluated to identify the cause.Hope above suggestions will be helpful to you.Should you have any further query, please feel free to ask at HCM.Wish your daughter the best of the health ahead.Thank you & Regards."},{"Patient":"My son is 3.4 years old and weight is 13 Kg.

For cold you can use anti-allergics like cetirizine and for nose block, saline nasal decongestants will do. Taxim-O is an antibiotic and it will not work for upper respiratory infections like this. Moreover as I said, 95% of times it is viral in kids. So antibiotic is not needed.Do not give both Sumol and Paracetamol. Use only one.

However I think the best place to get this diagnosed is with your regular doctor. It is possible that there may be a bacterial infection that has not yet been diagnosed and requires antibiotics. It is also possible that if the tonsils are so swollen that he is having difficulty breathing, he may need to be on steroid treatment for a period of 3 to 5 days in order to decrease the swelling of the tonsils, and ease his breathing. I recommend consulting with your doctor about this, so that the correct diagnosis can be made and the appropriate treatment plan implemented."},{"Patient":"Is it possible that my 19 month old breasfeeding baby could have thrush?

I just read through your question.I agree that it is possible that your son has oral thrush. One way to tell is by attempting to remove the white coating. If the white coating comes off, then it is most likely milk. If the white coating does not come off, it could be oral thrush.

I was just after some advise about wether this is most likely swollen glands or if it could be something more sinister.

MRI brain is a good modality to find out its cause. The child should be started on an Antiepileptic drug like tablet phenytoin(@5 mg/kg/day) or tab carbamazepine(@15mg/kg/day) if the seizure is one sided. The drug has to be continued daily for atleast 6 months seizure free. Then the drug is slowly tapered to completely stop it. Keep the child under surveillance for sometime after starting the drug. Dont leave her alone, dont send her to risky places, close to fire or water."},{"Patient":"11YR old daughter diagnosed MRSA+ 13 days ago started having high fever 5 days ago which we keep down with Advil cause also feeling unwell and severe fatigue.

This infection will require admission to a hospital and intravenous antibiotics in form of injection Vancomycin or Linezolid with a Gram negative coverage. Swollen tonsils suggest severe Upper Airway infection. Get your child admitted. Oral drugs wont respond to MRSA. Cold sweats means fever defervescence. It does not signify any serious issue."},{"Patient":"ECG on my 2 y.o. son revealed polytopic supraventricular extrasystoles. Holter analyses will be performed soon.

I understand this is little information yet, but how much such ECG is common for 2 y.o. , and how much (in %) could it be a situation to worry about?","Doctor":"PVC(premature supraventricular contraction) or supraventricular systole can be completely benign as in your case or they could occur with severe symptoms. They can be an incidental finding at many times. If the child has no symptoms, just the removal of triggers like caffeine or any drug helps to abolish the PVC. If it is associated with symptoms, anti-arrhythmics are used.In absence of any structural heart defect, the condition is benign and their is little to worry about. In presence of any defect, they can cause severe arryhthmias and symptoms.Holter method will simplify things further. Also get an ECG and ECHOcardiography done for your kid to rule out structural defect of heart."},{"Patient":"Hi , i was suffered from food poisining two weeks backs.

Could you help me understand this a bit more and suggest a few questions to ask to gain more clarity? Many thanks. Arun","Doctor":"neonatal seizures occur most commonly due to Hypoxic insult to brain(during delivery or post delivery if child does not immediately cry), or due to metabolic causes like low glucose, low calcium or low magnesium. Seizures can be due to infections acquired during or after delivery. Small blood in Subarachnoid space signifies trauma to head during delivery which can be normal. Periventricular involvement in the brain is serious. Seizures can be controlled as of now with AED like Phenobarbitone but the effect of the condition on the neonatal brain cant be judged at present.

The cause can be ovarian or in other glands. As your abnormal cycles are associated with pain, we need to rule out ovarian causes like cysts or masses etc. You also have symptoms suggestive of possible pancreatitis or any other intestinal infection. Please get an ultrasonogram to rule out any structural lesions. You also need to have certain blood tests for pancreatic and liver function as well as hormonal assays. Please visit a gynecologist for a pelvic and abdominal examination at the earliest. Wishing you the best!"},{"Patient":"Hi Doctor, My Son is 4 Years 4 months old.

The tiny bump does not seem to be fluid filled or hard. It is not red or painful. At first I thought it was a cyst, I thought I saw a tiny black dot on it but it may be my imagination.

Occasionally though it can present as right upper quadrant pain too. The symptoms you reported seems to be a gastric related problem - gastritis or ulcer. Yes, gall bladder pathology and liver pathology also needs to be ruled out to confirm before truly associating with the aforementioned causes. Ultrasound scan done several years ago is not conclusive to relate to the current problem. You need to repeat it again to note for liver status, size of gall bladder and whether or not a stone in it (gall bladder). In addition, I also would like to get gastroscopic (upper GI endoscopy) to done. Ovarian cyst hardly present with upper abdominal pain, and so this may not be related. I would suggest you to consult a gastroenterologist to streamline the tests and confirm the possibility. In the mean time avoid high spicy diet. Proper and regular diet with destressing measures are useful measures - as far as treatment is concerned. Hope this answers your query.
