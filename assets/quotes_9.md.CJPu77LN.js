In the place of Srednje Zuze, every phone number has five digits arranged in non-increasing or non-decreasing order, and the first digit is not 0. How many phone numbers can exist in this place at most?## Third grade - B category","solution":"5. If all digits are the same, there are 9 such numbers (all except 00000, as it does not satisfy the conditions of the problem). Let's further consider numbers that have at least two different digits.First, let's count how many such numbers can have digits in non-decreasing order. Each such number is uniquely determined by the selection of five digits that make it up (once the digits are chosen, the number is obtained by sorting them in non-decreasing order), and among the digits, there must not be a 0 (if there were, it would have to go at the beginning of the phone number due to the non-decreasing order, which is prohibited by the problem's conditions). If the number is composed of only two different digits, they form one of the following patterns: first one digit, then four of the same (larger than the previous one); first two of the same, then three of the same (larger than the previous ones); first three of the same, then two more of the same; first four of the same, then one more larger. Thus, from two fixed digits, we can make 4 phone numbers, and since these 2 digits can be chosen in binom{9}{2} ways, there are 4 cdot binom{9}{2} such phone numbers. If the number is composed of three different digits, they form one of the following patterns: 3+1+1, 1+3+1, 1+1+3, 2+2+1, 2+1+2, or 1+2+2, which is 6 possibilities, and since these three digits can be chosen in binom{9}{3} ways, this gives 6 cdot binom{9}{3} numbers. If the number is composed of four different digits, they form one of the following patterns: 1+1+1+2, 1+1+2+1, 1+2+1+1, or 2+1+1+1, so there are 4 cdot binom{9}{4} such numbers. Finally, those with all different digits have binom{9}{5}.Now let's count the numbers whose digits are in non-increasing order. The reasoning is the same, only we need to keep in mind that now we have 10 digits to choose from (since here the numbers can contain the digit 0), so we get another 4 cdot binom{10}{2} + 6 cdot binom{10}{3} + 4 cdot binom{10}{4} + binom{10}{5} phone numbers.The total result is: 9 + 4 cdot binom{9}{2} + 6 cdot binom{9}{3} + 4 cdot binom{9}{4} + binom{9}{5} + 4 cdot binom{10}{2} + 6 cdot binom{10}{3} + 4 cdot binom{10}{4} + binom{10}{5} = 9 + 144 + 504 + 504 + 126 + 180 + 720 + 840 + 252 = 3279 phone numbers.## Third Grade - B Category"},{"problem":"# 1.

We say that a set A of polynomials with real coefficients is beautiful if, whenever P and Q are two distinct elements of A, there exist positive integers a_{1}>cdots>a_{2020} such thatP Q=sum_{i=1}^{2020} i X^{a_{i}}What is the maximal cardinality of a beautiful set?","solution":"Solution to Exercise 18 Let A be a magnificent set. Suppose that A has 3 distinct elements, which we denote as P, Q, R.Since mathrm{P}^{2}=frac{(mathrm{PQ}) times(mathrm{PR})}{mathrm{QR}}, mathrm{P}^{2} is the product of two polynomials with integer coefficients, divided by a polynomial with integer coefficients. Therefore, it is a polynomial with rational coefficients that is also unitary. Indeed, the Euclidean algorithm for computing the GCD of two polynomials with rational coefficients yields a quotient and a remainder with rational coefficients, because the set of rationals is stable under division, multiplication, addition, and subtraction.Thus, P^{2} is a unitary polynomial with rational coefficients. Let P=sum_{n=0}^{d} a_{n} X^{n} with a_{d} neq 0. We have a_{d}^{2}=1, so a_{d}= pm 1. We will prove by strong downward induction that a_{i} is rational for all i between 0 and n.The base case comes from the fact that a_{n}= pm 1. For the inductive step, let i in{0, n-1} such that a_{i+1}, ldots, a_{n} are rational. The coefficient of degree i+n of P^{2} is sum_{j=i}^{n} a_{j} a_{n+i-j}=2 a_{i} a_{n}+sum_{j=i+1}^{n-1} a_{j} a_{n+i-j}.If i+1 leqslant j leqslant n-1, a_{j} and a_{n+i-j} are rational, so sum_{j=i+1}^{n-1} a_{j} a_{n+i-j} is rational. Since the coefficient of degree i+n of P^{2} is rational, 2 a_{i} a_{n} is also rational. Since a_{n}= pm 1, a_{i} is rational, which concludes the induction.Now, P^{2}(1)=1+cdots+2020=frac{2020 times 2021}{2}=1010 times 2021 which is divisible by 2 but not by 4. In particular, since P_{i} has rational coefficients, there exists (p, q) in mathbb{Z} times mathbb{N}^{*} such that P(1)=frac{p}{q}. Therefore, p^{2}=1010 times 2021 times q^{2}. We obtain that p neq 0, and that V_{2}left(p^{2}right)=2 V_{2}(p)=V_{2}left(1010 times 2021 times q^{2}right)= 1+2 V_{2}(q). We conclude that 2 V_{2}(p)=2 V_{2}(q)+1. Since the left term is even and the right term is odd, we obtain a contradiction.Thus, we cannot have |A| geqslant 3. However, we can have |A|=2 by taking A=left{1, sum_{i=1}^{2019} i X^{2019-i}right}, which works well. We conclude that the maximum cardinality of a magnificent set is 2.Alternative Solution n^{circ} 1 This solution is essentially the same as the previous one but presented from a different angle. The first solution proved that the coefficients of the polynomials are rational. The additional idea is to notice that the same can be said about the polynomials divided by sqrt{2020}. Suppose A supseteq{P, Q, R} is magnificent. Since P^{2} cdot Q R=P Q cdot R P and P Q, Q R, R P are unitary polynomials with rational coefficients, mathrm{P}^{2} is also unitary and has rational coefficients.Let tilde{P} be the polynomial obtained by reversing the coefficients of P. Precisely, if P=sum_{i=0}^{n} p_{i} X^{i} with p_{n} neq 0, then tilde{P}=sum_{tilde{i}=0}^{n} p_{n-i} X^{i}. Reversing the coefficients is compatible with multiplication, i.e., tilde{mathrm{PQ}}=tilde{mathrm{P}} tilde{mathrm{Q}}.In our case, we notice that frac{mathrm{PQ}}{2020}, frac{text { RR }}{2020}, frac{tilde{mathrm{RP}}}{2020} are also unitary and have rational coefficients becausefrac{tilde{P Q}}{2020}=sum_{i=1}^{2020} frac{i}{2020} X^{a_{1}-a_{i}}=X^{a_{1}-a_{2020}}+frac{2019}{2020} X^{a_{1}-a 2019}+cdots+frac{1}{2020}Thus, repeating the argument, since left(frac{tilde{mathrm{P}}}{sqrt{2020}}right)^{2} cdot frac{tilde{mathrm{QR}}}{2020}=frac{tilde{mathrm{P}}}{2020} cdot frac{tilde{mathrm{RP}}}{2020} and frac{tilde{mathrm{PQ}}}{2020}, frac{tilde{mathrm{Q} R}}{2020}, frac{tilde{mathrm{RP}}}{2020} are unitary polynomials with rational coefficients, left(frac{tilde{mathrm{P}}}{sqrt{2020}}right)^{2} is also unitary and has rational coefficients.As proven in Solution 1, from mathrm{P}^{2} in mathbb{Q}[mathrm{X}] and mathrm{P}^{2} being unitary, we get mathrm{P} in mathbb{Q}[mathrm{X}]. From left(frac{tilde{mathrm{P}}}{sqrt{2020}}right)^{2} in mathbb{Q}[mathrm{X}] and left(frac{tilde{mathrm{P}}}{sqrt{2020}}right)^{2} being unitary, we get frac{tilde{mathrm{P}}}{sqrt{2020}} in mathbb{Q}[mathrm{X}]. Contradiction, since mathrm{P} neq 0.Comment from the graders: The exercise was rarely attempted. The ideas provided by the students who tried the problem are excellent and demonstrate a good understanding of the exercise. There are few actual errors, and the only remark to make is that certain concepts (degree, Viète's formulas) were doomed to fail given that one could replace mathrm{P} in A with XP and that the degrees of the elements of A are poorly understood, an observation that can sometimes be salvaging."},{"problem":"Given that 0 < k < 2, find the maximum and minimum values of cos (β-γ) if the following equations hold:cos α+kcos β+(2-k)cos γ=0sin α+ksin β+(2-k)sin γ=0","solution":"We have,cos α+kcos β+(2-k)cos γ=0 qquad (①)sin α+ksin β+(2-k)sin γ=0 qquad (②)Moving the terms containing α to the right side, we get:kcos β+(2-k)cos γ=-cos α qquad (③)ksin β+(2-k)sin γ=-sin α qquad (④)Squaring both sides of (③) and (④), and then adding them together (to eliminate α), we obtain:k^{2}+(2-k)^{2}+2k(2-k)(cos βcos γ+sin βsin γ)=1therefore 2k^{2}-4k+4+2k(2-k)cos (β-γ)=1therefore cos (β-γ)= frac {2k^{2}-4k+3}{2k^{2}-4k}=1+ frac {3}{2k^{2}-4k}=1+ frac {3}{2[(k-1)^{2}-1]}Given that 0 < k < 2,When k=1, (k-1)^{2}-1 is minimum, and thus cos (β-γ) is maximum, boxed{cos (β-γ)=-0.5}The minimum value of the cosine of any angle is (-1).

Clearly the maximum value exists as a_{1}+2 a_{2}+3 a_{3}+cdots+24 a_{24} leq 1^{2}+2^{2}+cdots+24^{2}. Let's see what happens when maximality is reached. We claim that at maximality, we must have a_{m}=-m or a_{n}=n for any pair (m, n) satisfying 1 leq m<n leq 24. Indeed, if this is not true for some such (m, n), then we can replace a_{m} by a_{m}-1 and a_{n} by a_{n}+1, so that the conditions are still satisfied, but the value of a_{1}+2 a_{2}+3 a_{3}+cdots+24 a_{24} is increased by (n-m).

These are:   - (1,1), (2,1), (3,1), (4,1), (5,1), (6,1) because 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 all divide 1.   - (2,2), (4,2), (6,2) because 2 divides 2, 4, and 6.   - (3,3), (6,3) because 3 divides 3 and 6.   - (4,4) because 4 divides 4.   - (5,5) because 5 divides 5.   - (6,6) because 6 divides 6.   Counting these, we find there are 14 favorable outcomes.4. Calculate the Probability: The probability of event A happening is the ratio of the number of favorable outcomes to the total number of outcomes in the sample space. This can be calculated as:   [   P(A) = frac{text{Number of favorable outcomes}}{text{Total number of outcomes}} = frac{14}{36}   ]   Simplifying the fraction, we get:   [   P(A) = frac{7}{18}   ]Therefore, the probability that the number of points obtained in the first roll can be divided by the number of points obtained in the second roll is boxed{frac{7}{18}}.

Thus, both y-1 and y+1 are even, but since their difference is 2, only one is divisible by 4. In particular, either y+1 or y-1 is divisible by 2^{x-1}.- If 2^{x-1} divides y-1, we set y=1+2^{x-1} times k for k a natural number.

Looking modulo 2, we see that k is odd. Since 1+k is positive, k^{2}-8 is also positive, so k geqslant 3.

Suppose we want to show that the smallest integer sought is the integer c. There will then be two parts to the proof. On the one hand, it is necessary to show that if an integer k satisfies the property, then k geqslant c, on the other hand, it is necessary to show that we can indeed find a coloring of the integers with c colors.1) First, let's try to color the integers as we go in a naive way:- We color 2 with the first color- We also color 3 with the first color (it is possible because 2 does not divide 3).- 4 is divisible by 2, so we cannot color it with the same color as 2, we therefore color it with another color (the second color).- We can color 5 with the first color.- 6 being divisible by 2 and 3, we color it with the second color.- We can color 7 with the first color.- But 8 is divisible by 2 and 4, it must therefore be colored with a third color.We have thus obtained a coloring with 3 colors of the integers from 2 to 8. It is now necessary to verify that 3 colors are necessarily required in a coloring satisfying the property of the statement. In the previous construction, the problem was to color 8. Indeed, 8 is a multiple of 4 and 2 and 4 is a multiple of 2. Thus 4 cannot have the same color as 2 and 8 cannot have the same color as 2 or 4. Therefore, at least 3 different colors are needed to color 2,4,8, so the smallest number of colors necessary is k=3.2) Here, let's be inspired by the first question. We saw that 2,4,8 were the numbers bringing a constraint in the coloring. We notice that these are powers of 2. We can therefore conjecture that the powers of 2 play an important role in the problem. Among the integers from 2 to 32, there are 5 powers of 2: 2,4,8 and 16. As 2 divides 4,8,16,2 must necessarily be of a different color from the other 3. As 4 divides 8,16,4 must necessarily be of a different color from the other 2. Similarly, as 8 divides 16, 2,4,8,16 must necessarily have different colors from each other. Therefore, at least 4 different colors are needed.Conversely, we are looking for a coloring of the integers from 2 to 32 using exactly 4 colors. We can in fact continue the previous coloring by coloring each integer as we go with the smallest possible color. We get the following coloring:1. The numbers colored with color 1 are 2,3,5,7,11,13,17,19,23,29,312. The numbers colored with color 2 are 4,6,9,10,14,15,21,22,25,263. The numbers colored with color 3 are 8,12,18,20,27,28,304. The numbers colored with color 4 are 16,24We do indeed have a correct coloring with 4 colors, so the minimum number of colors is 4.Alternative solution: As in the previous case, we show that for the first question, at least 3 colors are needed and at least 4 in the second.Here we propose to generalize the previous coloring: we construct a coloring with the optimal number of colors to color the integers from 2 to r, with r geqslant 2. Let n geqslant 2, and let n=p_{1}^{a_{1}} times cdots times p_{k}^{a_{k}} be its prime factorization. We will color n with the color a_{1}+cdots+a_{k} (note that since n geqslant 2, we indeed have a_{1}+cdots+a_{k} geqslant 1). Let's show that this coloring is correct: let m neq n be two integers such that m divides n. Let n=p_{1}^{a_{1}} times cdots times p_{k}^{a_{k}} be its prime factorization. m necessarily writes as m=p_{1}^{b_{1}} times cdots times p_{k}^{b_{k}} with b_{1} leqslant a_{1}, ldots b_{k} leqslant a_{k}. Since m neq n, there must necessarily be an i such that a_{i} neq b_{i}, so a_{i}>b_{i}. Thus we must have a_{1}+cdots+a_{k}>b_{1}+cdots+b_{k}, so m and n are indeed of different colors.If n leqslant 8 and n=p_{1}^{a_{1}} times cdots times p_{k}^{a_{k}} then 2^{3}=8 geqslant n geqslant 2^{a_{1}+cdots+a_{k}} so a_{1}+cdots+a_{k} leqslant 3, the coloring uses at most 3 colors for the integers from 2 to 8, so for the first question, the minimal k is 3.If n leqslant 31 and n=p_{1}^{a_{1}} times cdots times p_{k}^{a_{k}} then 2^{5}=32>n geqslant 2^{a_{1}+cdots+a_{k}} so a_{1}+cdots+a_{k}n. Let j be an integer such that 2 leqslant j leqslant n. Let l be the largest integer such that 2^{l} leqslant j and similarly 2^{l+1}>j. Since 2 leqslant j leqslant n<2^{k+1}, we have 1 leqslant l<k+1, so 1 leqslant l leqslant k. We will color j with the color l.Note that since 1 leqslant l leqslant k, this coloring uses at most k colors. Since 2 leqslant 2 leqslant 4 leqslant cdots leqslant 2^{k} leqslant n, the 2^{j} for 1 leqslant j leqslant k are between 2 and n, and since 2^{j} is colored with the color j, the coloring uses exactly j colors.This coloring also satisfies the property of the statement: let m, n such that m divides n and m neq n. Let j be the color of m, we have m geqslant 2^{j}. Since m divides n and m neq n, n geqslant 2 m geqslant 2^{j+1}, so n cannot be colored with the color j, otherwise we would have n<2^{j+1}.In particular for n=8, since 2^{3}=8<2^{4}, the proposed coloring uses 3 colors and for n=31, since 2^{4} leqslant n<2^{5}, the coloring uses 4 colors. Thus for the first question, the minimal k is 3, for the second it is 4.Comment: In this exercise, each question contained two parts. For example, for question 2), it was necessary to show on the one hand that we can color the integers with 4 colors, on the other hand, it is necessary to show that, whatever the coloring, it always uses at least 4 colors. It is only by treating each point separately that one could get the maximum score. Moreover, a large part of the students made good progress on the problem and provided a valid coloring with the right number of colors."},{"problem":"7.7.

Determine the largest prime number among them.","solution":"1. Let P be the set of prime numbers under investigation, and first show that 2 notin P. The number 2 is the only prime number that is not odd. If 2 in P, the sum of all primes in P (an odd number of them) would be even, and the sum of an even number of them would be odd, so the arithmetic mean could not be the odd number 27. Therefore, 2 notin P.Since the number 27 is not a prime number, the set P is not a singleton, and for its largest element p^{*}, it holds that p^{*} > 27. Now, we will use this obvious fact: The arithmetic mean A of a set of real numbers decreases whenever we add a number smaller than A to the set or remove a number larger than A from the set. Therefore, let's add all the missing prime numbers p, 2 < p < 27 to the set P and remove all prime numbers p, 27 < p < p^{*} (if any exist). This gives us a set of nine prime numbers left{3,5,7,11,13,17,19,23, p^{*}right}, for which the arithmetic mean (which may no longer be an integer) satisfies the estimatefrac{3+5+7+11+13+17+19+23+p^{*}}{9} leqq 27(Equality holds if we neither added any prime number nor removed any.) From this, we get p^{*} leqq 145. The largest prime number that satisfies this inequality is 139.The value p^{*}=139 is possible, as shown by the exampleP={3,5,7,11,13,17,19,29,139},which we find when we replace the prime number 23 in the sum 3+5+7+11+13+17+19+23 with a prime number that is 145-139=6 larger. (If we had not realized that 2 notin P beforehand, we would have obtained from the inequalityfrac{2+3+5+7+11+13+17+19+23+p^{*}}{10} leqq 27the weaker estimate p^{*} leqq 170. Then it would be necessary to rule out the values p^{*}=167,163,157, 151,149. In doing so, we would likely realize why 2 notin P.)For p^{*}=139, there is one more set P with the required properties.

For this, it is sufficient to prove that a graph with twelve edges must contain a quadrilateral. First, we point out a few facts:(1) Suppose point A is connected to points A_{1}, A_{2}, cdots, A_{k}, and B is a vertex different from A (which can be one of the points in left{A_{1}, A_{2}, cdots, A_{k}right}). If B is connected to two points in left{A_{1}, A_{2}, cdots, A_{k}right}, then the graph contains a quadrilateral.(2) In a graph with four vertices, if there are five edges, there must be a quadrilateral.Let G be a simple graph with eight vertices and twelve edges. We will prove that G must contain a quadrilateral. We use proof by contradiction, i.e., assume G has no quadrilateral. Let d_{1}, d_{2}, cdots, d_{8} be the degrees of the eight vertices of G. Sincesum_{i=1}^{8} d_{i}=2 times 12=24, max left(d_{1}, d_{2}, cdots, d_{8}right) geqslant 3We will discuss the following three cases.i max left(d_{1}, d_{2}, cdots, d_{8}right)=3. In this case, the degree of each vertex in G is 3. Take any vertex A, and let the vertices connected to A be A_{1}, A_{2}, A_{3}, and the remaining four vertices be B_{1}, B_{2}, B_{3}, B_{4}. By (1), the number of edges between left{B_{1}, B_{2}, B_{3}, B_{4}right} and left{A_{1}, A_{2}, A_{3}right} is at most four. The number of edges between the vertices in left{A_{1}, A_{2}, A_{3}right} is at most one, so the number of edges between the vertices in left{B_{1}, B_{2}, B_{3}, B_{4}right} is at least 12-3-4-1=4 (by (2), there are also only four edges). We only consider these four vertices and the four edges connecting them. At this time, there must be a vertex with degree 1 (if the degree of these four points is all 2, it will form a quadrilateral). Thus, there is a vertex with degree 3, i.e., there must be a point (let's say B_{1}) in left{B_{1}, B_{2}, B_{3}, B_{4}right} that is connected to the other three points B_{2}, B_{3}, B_{4}. And the number of edges between the points in left{B_{1}, B_{2}, B_{3}, B_{4}right} and the points in left{A_{2}, A_{3}, A_{4}right} is 4, so B_{1} must be connected to one of the points in left{A_{2}, A_{3}, A_{4}right}.

Since the total number of edges is 12, the sum of the above edge numbers is 2,3,3. Therefore, the number of edges between the points in left{A_{1}, A_{2}, A_{3}, A_{4}right} is 2, let's say A_{1} A_{2} and A_{3} A_{4} (these two edges do not share a common vertex, otherwise a quadrilateral will appear).

Since each point in left{B_{1}, B_{2}, B_{3}right} is connected to one of the points in left{A_{1}, A_{2}, A_{3}, A_{4}right}, at least two points are connected to one of the points in left{A_{1}, A_{2}right} or left{A_{3}, A_{4}right}, let's say left{B_{1}, B_{2}, B_{3}right} has two points B_{1}, B_{2} connected to one of the points in left{A_{1}, A_{2}right}. At this time, if B_{1}, B_{2} are both connected to the same point (let's say A_{1}), A_{1} B_{1} B_{3} B_{2} is a quadrilateral. If B_{1}, B_{2} are connected to different points in left{A_{1}, A_{2}right}, then because A_{1} A_{2}, B_{1} B_{2} are both edges, there is still a quadrilateral, which contradicts the assumption.iii max left(d_{1}, cdots, d_{8}right)>4.

For the pair a=b=1, we get the inequality for the parameter p>0, which we solve:begin{aligned}2 sqrt{p+1} & geqq p+1 2 & geqq sqrt{p+1} p & leqq 3end{aligned}We will now show that the required property holds for every p in(0,3rangle.For p in(0,1rangle, the given inequality is trivially satisfied, sincesqrt{a^{2}+p b^{2}}>a, quad sqrt{b^{2}+p a^{2}}>b quad text { and } quad(p-1) sqrt{a b} leqq 0 .Therefore, we will focus on the case p in(1,3rangle. The left-hand side L of the inequality to be proven can be interpreted as the magnitude of two vectors (a, b sqrt{p}),(b, a sqrt{p}) in mathbb{R}^{2}, so by the triangle inequality,begin{aligned}L=sqrt{a^{2}+p b^{2}}+sqrt{b^{2}+p a^{2}} & =|(a, b sqrt{p})|+|(b, a sqrt{p})| geqq & geqq|(a+b,(a+b) sqrt{p})|=(a+b) sqrt{1+p} .end{aligned}For the right-hand side P, using the inequality between the arithmetic and geometric means, we obtain an upper boundP=a+b+(p-1) sqrt{a b} leqq a+b+(p-1) frac{a+b}{2}=frac{(p+1)(a+b)}{2} .The inequality L geqq P is thus proven, since the stronger inequality(a+b) sqrt{p+1} geqq frac{(p+1)(a+b)}{2}is equivalent to the inequality sqrt{p+1} leqq 2, which is clearly satisfied for every p in(1,3rangle.Note.

Finding the Maximum Value of y:At x = frac{pi}{2}, the sine function reaches its maximum in the given interval, which means sinleft(frac{pi}{2}right) = 1. Thus, at this point, the value of y becomes 1 - frac{m}{2}.2. Determining the Conditions for Two Zeros:For the function to have two zeros, the maximum value must be positive, which implies that 1 - frac{m}{2} > 0. Solving this inequality for m gives us:1 - frac{m}{2} > 0 implies 1 > frac{m}{2} implies 2 > m.3. Analyzing the Function at the Bounds of the Interval:At x = frac{pi}{3} and x = frac{4pi}{3}, the sine function takes the value frac{sqrt{3}}{2}. Therefore, at these points, the value of y becomes frac{sqrt{3}}{2} - frac{m}{2}. For the function to have two zeros, this value must be less than or equal to zero, leading to:frac{sqrt{3}}{2} - frac{m}{2} leq 0 implies frac{sqrt{3}}{2} leq frac{m}{2} implies sqrt{3} leq m.Combining the two conditions derived for m, we get the range of m as:sqrt{3} leq m < 2.Therefore, the range of real number m is [sqrt{3}, 2).4. Finding the Sum of the Two Zeros:Given that the zeros of the function are symmetric about x = frac{pi}{2}, and considering the interval left[frac{pi}{3}, frac{4pi}{3}right], the symmetry implies that the sum of the two zeros is twice the value of frac{pi}{2}, which is pi.Hence, the final answer is:- The range of real number m is boxed{[sqrt{3}, 2)}.- The sum of the two zeros is boxed{pi}."},{"problem":"At the press conference summarizing the Hangzhou Asian Games on October 7th, the reporter learned that as of the morning of the 7th, the total number of tickets sold for the Hangzhou Asian Games exceeded 3050000.

But then the left side of the initial expression for all x, y in mathbb{Z} is equal to frac{f(f(0))}{f(0)}, and the right side is frac{f(f(0))^{2}}{f(0)^{2}}+y. Since it is impossible for frac{f(f(0))}{f(0)}=frac{f(f(0))^{2}}{f(0)^{2}}+y to hold for every y in mathbb{Z}, we conclude that f(0)=0. Now substitute y=1 into the initial expression. We get that for every x in mathbb{Z},f(x+f(1))=f(x) f(1)+1In particular, for x=-f(1), using f(0)=0, we get 0=f(-f(1)) f(1)+1, orf(-f(1)) f(1)=-1Since f(1) and f(-f(1)) are integers, we conclude that f(1)=1 or f(1)=-1.If f(1)=1, then from (1) we get that for every x in mathbb{Z}, f(x+1)=f(x)+1. It follows that if f(x)=x, then f(x+1)=x+1 and f(x-1)=x-1, and since f(0)=0, by mathematical induction we conclude that f(x)=x for every x in mathbb{Z}. It is easy to verify that this function satisfies the initial condition.If f(1)=-1, then f(-f(1))=1.

Without loss of generality, let E be the lowest point. Translate the square A B C D so that B coincides with E (Figure 1.12(1)). At this time, the square A B C D still covers triangle E F G.(2) Let B coincide with E. Connect B D. Since angle F B G=60^{circ} > angle D B A=45^{circ}, F and G are not on the same side of B D. If angle F B D neq angle D B G, without loss of generality, assume angle F B D > 30^{circ} > angle D B G. Rotate triangle F B G around point B to triangle F^{prime} B G^{prime}, so that angle F^{prime} B D=30^{circ} (Figure 1.12(2)).We claim that F^{prime} is still inside triangle B C D. To verify this, let the rays B F and B F^{prime} intersect C D at H and H^{prime}, respectively. Since angle F^{prime} B C > angle F B C, B H^{prime} > B H geqslant B F = B F^{prime}, thus point F^{prime} is inside the segment B H^{{prime}, and therefore inside triangle B C D.G^{prime} is symmetric to F^{prime} with respect to B D, so G^{prime} is also inside the square A B C D.Therefore, we can assume angle F B D = angle D B G = 30^{circ}, otherwise, we use triangle F^{prime} B G^{prime} to replace triangle F E G (or, keeping triangle E F G fixed, rotate the square A B C D around B in the opposite direction so that angle F B D = 30^{circ}).(3) Let B coincide with E, and angle F B D = angle D B G = 30^{circ}. If point F is not on C D, draw C^{prime} D^{prime} parallel C D through F, and A^{prime} D^{prime} parallel A D through G, to form the square A^{prime} B C^{prime} D^{prime} (Figure 1.12(3)). This is a smaller square than A B C D, and it still covers triangle E F G.Combining (1), (2), and (3), we can conclude that every square that covers triangle E F G is not smaller than the square A B C D in Figure 1.13.Therefore, the side length a of the square A B C D in the figure is the smallest.Finding the side length a at this time is not difficult.

We need to find the multiplicative inverse of 6 modulo 7. The multiplicative inverse of 6 modulo 7 is the number k such that:   [   6k equiv 1 pmod{7}   ]   By trial, we find that k = 6 works because:   [   6 cdot 6 = 36 equiv 1 pmod{7}   ]7. Therefore, n equiv 6 pmod{7}, which means:   [   n = 7k + 6 quad text{for some integer } k   ]8. Substituting n = 7k + 6 back into x = 6n, we get:   [   x = 6(7k + 6) = 42k + 36   ]9. Thus, the numbers we are looking for are of the form 42k + 36.10. We need to find all such numbers less than 2006. Solving for k:    [    42k + 36 < 2006    ]    [    42k < 1970    ]    [    k < frac{1970}{42} approx 46.9048    ]    So, k can take integer values from 0 to 46.11. The sequence of numbers is 36, 78, 120, ldots, 1968. This is an arithmetic sequence with the first term a = 36 and common difference d = 42.12. The number of terms in the sequence is 47 (from k = 0 to k = 46).13. The sum of an arithmetic sequence is given by:    [    S_n = frac{n}{2} (2a + (n-1)d)    ]    Substituting n = 47, a = 36, and d = 42:    [    S_{47} = frac{47}{2} (2 cdot 36 + (47-1) cdot 42)    ]    [    S_{47} = frac{47}{2} (72 + 1932)    ]    [    S_{47} = frac{47}{2} cdot 2004    ]    [    S_{47} = 47 cdot 1002    ]    [    S_{47} = 47094    ]The final answer is boxed{47094}."},{"problem":"Triangle ABC has side lengths AB=7, BC=8, and CA=9.

Initial Setup and Definitions:   - Define the polynomials ( P(x) = x + 1 ) and ( Q(x) = x^2 + 1 ).   - Consider sequences (langle (x_k, y_k) rangle_{k in mathbb{N}}) such that ((x_1, y_1) = (1, 3)).   - For each (k), ((x_{k+1}, y_{k+1})) is either ((P(x_k), Q(y_k))) or ((Q(x_k), P(y_k))).2. Definition of Nice Numbers:   - A positive integer (n) is nice if (x_n = y_n) holds in at least one of these sequences.3. Checking (n = 3):   - For (n = 3), consider the sequence ((1, 3) to (2, 4) to (5, 5)).   - Clearly, (x_3 = y_3 = 5), so (n = 3) is a nice number.4.

Further Analysis:   - (y_{n-2} = P(y_{n-3})) implies ((t^2 + 1)^2 - 2 = y_{n-3}^2), which is impossible.   - Therefore, (y_{n-2} = P(y_{n-3}) = y_{n-3} + 1).9.

When A and B are the left and right vertices of the ellipse, we have A(-2,0) and B(2,0). The position vectors overrightarrow{AP}=(x_{P}+2,y_{P}) and overrightarrow{BP}=(x_{P}-2,y_{P}). For angle APB = 90^{circ}, we need overrightarrow{AP} cdot overrightarrow{BP} = 0, which results in x_{P}^{2}-4+y_{P}^{2}=0...(1). Since point P lies on the ellipse, frac{x_{P}^{2}}{4}+y_{P}^{2}=1. Substitute y_{P}^{2}=1-frac{x_{P}^{2}}{4} in equation (1) and solve for x_{P}, we get x_{P}= pm 2 and consequently y_{P}=0. Clearly, this contradicts the fact that P is a point on the ellipse distinct from A and B. Therefore, no such point P exists.(II) Let P(x_{P},y_{P}) and A(x_{A},y_{A}). According to the problem, line l_{1} passes through the origin, so B(-x_{A},-y_{A}). As P is a point on the ellipse distinct from A and B, the slopes of lines PA and PB are k_{1}=frac{y_{P}-y_{A}}{x_{P}-x_{A}} and k_{2}=frac{y_{P}+y_{A}}{x_{P}+x_{A}}, respectively.Thus, k_{1} cdot k_{2} = frac{y_{P}^{2}-y_{A}^{2}}{x_{P}^{2}-x_{A}^{2}}.The equation of ellipse W can be rewritten as x^{2}+4y^{2}=4. Since both points P and A lie on the ellipse, we have the following system:begin{cases} x_{P}^{2}+4y_{P}^{2}=4  x_{A}^{2}+4y_{A}^{2}=4 end{cases}Subtracting the second equation from the first, we get x_{P}^{2}-x_{A}^{2}+4(y_{P}^{2}-y_{A}^{2})=0. Since points P and A are distinct, 1+4 cdot frac{y_{P}^{2}-y_{A}^{2}}{x_{P}^{2}-x_{A}^{2}}=0, which leads to k_{1} cdot k_{2} = frac{y_{P}^{2}-y_{A}^{2}}{x_{P}^{2}-x_{A}^{2}} = -frac{1}{4}.(III) First Method: Since lines l_{2} and l_{3} are parallel to lines PA and PB, respectively, the slopes of lines l_{2} and l_{3} are k_{CD}=k_{1} and k_{EF}=k_{2}. Let the equation of line l_{2} be y=k_{1}x. Substitute this in the ellipse equation, we get x^{2}+4k_{1}^{2}x^{2}=4, and solving for x^{2}, we have x^{2}=frac{4}{4k_{1}^{2}+1}. Let C(x_{C},y_{C}). As line l_{2} passes through the origin, D(-x_{C},-y_{C}).We have |CD|^{2}=[x_{C}-(-x_{C})]^{2}+[y_{C}-(-y_{C})]^{2}=4(x_{C}^{2}+y_{C}^{2}). Since y_{C}=k_{1}x_{C}, |CD|^{2}=4(1+k_{1}^{2})x_{C}^{2}, which implies |CD|^{2}=16 frac{k_{1}^{2}+1}{4k_{1}^{2}+1}.Similarly, for line l_{3}, its equation is y=k_{2}x.

Substituting this in the above equation, we get:|CD|^{2} + |EF|^{2} = 16 left(frac{k_{1}^{2}+1}{4k_{1}^{2}+1} + frac{frac{1}{16k_{1}^{2}}+1}{4 cdot frac{1}{16k_{1}^{2}}+1}right)Simplifying this expression, we obtain |CD|^{2} + |EF|^{2} = 16 left[frac{4k_{1}^{2}+4+16k_{1}^{2}+1}{4(4k_{1}^{2}+1)}right] = boxed{20}."},{"problem":"Let n be a natural number, with the prime factorisation    [ n = p_1^{e_1} p_2^{e_2} cdots p_r^{e_r} ] where p_1, ldots, p_r are distinct primes, and e_i is a natural number.

This implies:   [   0 < P(n) leq n   ]   for infinitely many ( n ).3. Degree of ( P(x) ):   Given that ( P(n) leq n ) for infinitely many ( n ), we can infer:   [   lim_{n to infty} frac{P(n)}{n} leq 1   ]   This implies that the degree of ( P(x) ) must be at most 1, i.e., ( deg P(x) leq 1 ).4. Case 1: ( P(x) ) is a constant polynomial:   Let ( P(x) = c ) where ( c in mathbb{Q} ). For ( P(n) = text{rad}(n) ) to hold for infinitely many ( n ), ( c ) must be a square-free integer (since ( text{rad}(n) ) is always square-free). Therefore, ( P(x) = c ) where ( c ) is a square-free integer.5. Case 2: ( P(x) ) is a linear polynomial:   Let ( P(x) = frac{ax + b}{c} ) for some ( a, b, c in mathbb{Z} ) with ( a, c > 0 ). We need to check if this form can satisfy ( P(n) = text{rad}(n) ) for infinitely many ( n ).   - Subcase 2.1: ( b neq 0 ):     If ( b neq 0 ), then for ( P(n) = text{rad}(n) ) to hold for infinitely many ( n ), we would have:     [     text{rad}(n) mid b     ]     for infinitely many ( n ). This is impossible because ( text{rad}(n) ) can take arbitrarily large values, leading to a contradiction.   - Subcase 2.2: ( b = 0 ):     If ( b = 0 ), then ( P(x) = frac{ax}{c} ).

Considering that a total of 150 bugs were distributed, we get x leq 10.On the other hand, in the tenth jar there should be no more than 2 x bugs, in the ninth - no more than 2 x-1 bugs, and so on. This means that in the first jar - no more than 2 x-9 bugs, and the total number of bugs - no more than 20 x-45. Since a total of 150 bugs were distributed, then x geq 10.Thus, there are exactly 10 bugs in the first jar, and 19 or 20 in the last jar.

However this robot is not programmed perfectly, and sometimes takes the upper-left diagonal path (a,b)mapsto(a-1,b+1). As the grid is surrounded by walls, the robot cannot go outside the region 0leq a,bleq5. Supposing that the robot takes the diagonal path exactly once, compute the number of different routes the robot can take.","solution":"1. Define the problem and constraints:   - The robot starts at ((0,0)) and wants to reach ((5,5)) on a (5 times 5) grid.   - The robot can move right ((a,b) mapsto (a+1,b)), up ((a,b) mapsto (a,b+1)), or diagonally up-left ((a,b) mapsto (a-1,b+1)).   - The robot takes the diagonal path exactly once and cannot go outside the grid (0 leq a, b leq 5).2. Generalize the problem for an (n times n) grid:   - Let (P = (x,y)) be the point where the robot takes the diagonal path.   - The point ((x-1, y+1)) must be inside the grid, so (1 leq x leq n) and (0 leq y leq n-1).3. Define the paths (l_1) and (l_2):   - (l_1) is the path from ((0,0)) to ((x,y)).   - (l_2) is the path from ((x-1, y+1)) to ((n,n)).4. Transform (l_2) for easier counting:   - Shift (l_2) down by one square and to the right by one square, making it a path from ((x,y)) to ((n+1, n-1)).   - Concatenate (l_1) and (l_2) to form (l'), a path from ((0,0)) to ((n+1, n-1)).5. Count the number of valid paths:   - Without constraints on (P), there are (binom{2n}{n-1} cdot (2n+1)) pairs, as there are ((2n+1)) points on (l').   - Subtract the number of invalid points (P) not in the region (1 leq x leq n, 0 leq y leq n-1).6. Calculate the number of invalid points:   - Invalid points are either ((0,k)) or ((n+1,k)) for (0 leq k leq n-1).   - For (P = (0,k)), there is one path from ((0,0)) to (P) and (binom{2n-k}{n+1}) paths from (P) to ((n+1, n-1)).   - For (P = (n+1,k)), there are (binom{n+1+k}{n+1}) paths from ((0,0)) to (P) and one path from (P) to ((n+1, n-1)).7.

Each subset contains elements in a count that equals the index of that subset; for instance, the 1st subset has 1 element, the 2nd has 2 elements, and so on until the nth subset has n elements. The last term of the nth subset, which is also the nth element of the nth subset, is frac{n}{1}, which can be simplified to n. To identify the subset that contains a_{2009}, we look for an n such that a_{2009} is the (2009)th term, following the cumulative count of terms up to the nth subset. This cumulative count for the nth subset is denoted by the formula frac{n(n+1)}{2}.

Therefore, a_{2009} corresponds to the fraction in the 63rd subset with a denominator of 8 and a numerator of (63 - 8 + 1) = 56.

If 2 bags are randomly selected, the probability that both bags contain milk that has not expired is ______.","solution":"To solve the problem, we can consider all possible combinations and then determine the probability of selecting 2 bags that contain milk which has not expired.Step 1: Identify the total number of ways to select 2 bags out of 5.We have a total of 5 bags, among which 2 have expired milk (denoted as A and B) and 3 have milk that has not expired (denoted as a, b, and c). The total number of ways to choose 2 bags from these 5 is calculated using the combination formula binom{n}{r} = frac{n!}{r!(n-r)!}, where n is the total number of items, and r is the number of items to choose. Therefore, we have:[Total combinations = binom{5}{2} = frac{5!}{2!(5-2)!} = frac{5 times 4}{2} = 10]Step 2: Identify the total number of favorable outcomes.The favorable outcomes are the scenarios where both bags contain milk that has not expired. The combinations for this scenario are ab, ac, and bc. This gives us a total of 3 favorable outcomes.Step 3: Calculate the probability.The probability of an event is given by the ratio of the number of favorable outcomes to the total number of outcomes. Therefore, the probability P that both bags selected contain milk that has not expired is:[P = frac{Number of favorable outcomes}{Total combinations} = frac{3}{10}]Hence, the probability that both bags selected contain milk that has not expired is boxed{frac{3}{10}}."},{"problem":"Find the interval of monotonic increase for the function y=lg(4-x^2).","solution":"First, let's determine the domain of the function. For the logarithmic function to be defined, the argument must be positive:4-x^2 > 0.Solving the inequality, we get x^2 < 4, which implies that-2 < x < 2.Therefore, the domain of the function is x in (-2, 2).Now, set t = 4 - x^2. The graph of t is a downward-opening parabola that is symmetric about the y-axis.In the interval (-2, 0), the value of t increases as x increases since the right side of the parabola moves upwards on this interval. In contrast, in the interval (0, 2), the value of t decreases as x increases because the right side of the parabola slopes downward.Since the base of the logarithm in y=lg(4-x^2) is 10, which is greater than 1, the function is increasing when its argument, t, is increasing.Therefore, the function y=lg(4-x^2) is monotonically increasing on the interval (-2, 0).Hence, the interval of monotonic increase for the function is boxed{(-2, 0)},"},{"problem":"1.

Assigning Variables to Distances: Let the distance |F_{2}Q|=t, where t > 0. Given the ratios, we can express the other distances in terms of t:   - |PQ| = 4t because the ratio |F_{2}Q|:|PQ| = 1:4.   - |F_{1}Q| = 5t because the ratio |F_{1}Q|:|F_{2}Q| = 5:1.   - Therefore, the distance |PF_{2}| = |PQ| - |F_{2}Q| = 4t - t = 3t.2. Using the Property of Ellipse: The sum of the distances from any point on an ellipse to the foci is constant and equal to the major axis length, 2a. Thus, |F_{1}Q| + |F_{2}Q| = 2a. Substituting the distances we have:   - 5t + t = 6t = 2a, which simplifies to a = 3t.3. Finding |PF_{1}|: The distance from P to F_{1} can be found by subtracting |PF_{2}| from the total length of the major axis, 2a:   - |PF_{1}| = 2a - |PF_{2}| = 6t - 3t = 3t.4. Determining the Right Angle: By applying the Pythagorean theorem, we see that |PQ|^2 + |PF_{1}|^2 = |F_{1}Q|^2. Substituting the values we have:   - (4t)^2 + (3t)^2 = (5t)^2, which confirms that angle F_{1}PQ = 90^{circ}. This means PF_{1} perp PF_{2}.5. Calculating the Area of triangle QF_{1}F_{2}: The area of triangle QF_{1}F_{2} can be found by subtracting the area of triangle F_{1}PF_{2} from the area of triangle F_{1}PQ:   - {S}_{triangle Q{F}_{1}{F}_{2}} = frac{1}{2} times |PF_{1}| times |PQ| - frac{1}{2} times |PF_{1}| times |PF_{2}| = frac{1}{2} times 3t times 4t - frac{1}{2} times 3t times 3t = frac{3}{2}t^2.   - Since a = 3t, substituting t = frac{a}{3} into the area formula gives {S}_{triangle Q{F}_{1}{F}_{2}} = frac{3}{2} left(frac{a}{3}right)^2 = frac{a^2}{6}.Therefore, the area of triangle QF_{1}F_{2} is boxed{frac{a^2}{6}}, which corresponds to choice boxed{B}."},{"problem":"IMO 1981 Problem A3 Determine the maximum value of m 2 + n 2 , where m and n are integers in the range 1, 2, ... , 1981 satisfying (n 2 - mn - m 2 ) 2 = 1.","solution":"Experimenting with small values suggests that the solutions of n 2 - mn - m 2 = 1 or -1 are successive Fibonacci numbers.

Restate the problem in terms of permutations:   We need to find a permutation {a_i} of the set {1, 2, ldots, 12} such that for any 1 leq i < j leq 12, the absolute difference |a_i - a_j| is not equal to the absolute difference |i - j|.2. Reformulate the problem using chessboard analogy:   This problem can be rephrased as finding a permutation {a_i} such that no two (a_i + i)'s are equal and no two (a_i - i)'s are equal. This is analogous to placing 12 queens on a 12 times 12 chessboard such that no two queens attack each other.3. Find a valid permutation:   After experimenting with different permutations, we find that the permutation (1, 6, 8, 10, 7, 4, 2, 9, 12, 3, 5, 11) satisfies the conditions.

Choosing Four Points: Select any four vertices ( A, B, C, D ) of the polygon. We will analyze the area of the quadrilateral formed by these points.3. Rearranging Points: If there exists another vertex ( E ) such that the perpendicular distance from ( E ) to the line ( AC ) is greater than the perpendicular distance from ( B ) to ( AC ), then replace ( B ) with ( E ).

(1) Find cos 2alpha  and sin 2alpha;  (2) Find the value of 3alpha +beta.","solution":" Solution:# Part (1): Finding cos 2alpha and sin 2alphaGiven cos alpha = frac{sqrt{5}}{5} and alpha in (0, pi), we can deduce that alpha must be in the first quadrant, i.e., alpha in (0, frac{pi}{2}). This implies 2alpha in (0, pi), and thus sin 2alpha > 0.- For cos 2alpha, we use the double angle formula:cos 2alpha = 2cos^2alpha - 1 = 2left(frac{sqrt{5}}{5}right)^2 - 1 = frac{2}{5} - 1 = -frac{3}{5}.- For sin 2alpha, since sin^2 2alpha = 1 - cos^2 2alpha, we find:sin 2alpha = sqrt{1 - cos^2 2alpha} = sqrt{1 - left(-frac{3}{5}right)^2} = sqrt{1 - frac{9}{25}} = sqrt{frac{16}{25}} = frac{4}{5}.Thus, we have cos 2alpha = -frac{3}{5} and sin 2alpha = frac{4}{5}.# Part (2): Finding the value of 3alpha + betaGiven the constraints and the values found in part (1), we proceed as follows:- Since cos 2alpha = -frac{3}{5} and this value is negative, 2alpha must be in the second quadrant, i.e., 2alpha in (frac{pi}{2}, pi). This further implies alpha in (frac{pi}{4}, frac{pi}{2}).- Given sin(alpha + beta) = -frac{sqrt{2}}{10}, and since the sine function is negative in the third and fourth quadrants, alpha + beta must be in one of these quadrants. However, considering the range of alpha and the given condition, alpha + beta in (pi, frac{3pi}{2}).- The cosine of alpha + beta can be found using the Pythagorean identity, leading to cos(alpha + beta) = -sqrt{1 - sin^2(alpha + beta)} = -sqrt{1 - left(-frac{sqrt{2}}{10}right)^2} = -frac{7sqrt{2}}{10}.- For cos(3alpha + beta), using the angle sum formula:cos(3alpha + beta) = cos(alpha + beta + 2alpha) = cos(alpha + beta)cos(2alpha) - sin(alpha + beta)sin(2alpha)= left(-frac{7sqrt{2}}{10}right)left(-frac{3}{5}right) + left(-frac{sqrt{2}}{10}right)left(frac{4}{5}right) = frac{21sqrt{2}}{50} - frac{4sqrt{2}}{50} = frac{17sqrt{2}}{50}.Given the constraints and the positive value of cos(3alpha + beta), we find that 3alpha + beta must be in the fourth quadrant. Considering all the constraints and the given information, we conclude that 3alpha + beta = frac{7pi}{4}.Therefore, the value of 3alpha + beta is boxed{frac{7pi}{4}}."},{"problem":"In an acute-angled triangle ABC, CD is the altitude.

Given: In an acute-angled triangle ABC, CD is the altitude. A line through the midpoint M of side AB meets the rays CA and CB at K and L respectively such that CK = CL. Point S is the circumcenter of the triangle CKL. We need to prove that SD = SM.2. Step 1: Since M is the midpoint of AB and CK = CL, by Menelaus' theorem for triangle ABC cut by the straight line KML, we get AK = BL. This is because the product of the segments divided by the transversal in Menelaus' theorem must equal 1, and since M is the midpoint, AK = BL.3. Step 2: Let E be the point where the circumcircle of triangle CKL intersects the circumcircle of triangle ABC at a point other than C. Since CK = CL, E is the center of the rotation carrying AK into BL. Due to EA = EB, E is the midpoint of the arc AB of odot(ABC). 4. Step 3: Since E lies on the internal bisector of angle ACB, O (the circumcenter of triangle CKL) lies on CE. Since CE is the circumdiameter of triangle CKL and is perpendicular to KL, O is the midpoint of CE.5. Step 4: Let A' and B' denote the midpoints of CB and CA respectively. The positive homothety with center C and factor frac{1}{2} transforms A and B into A' and B', and E into O. The perpendicular bisector of AB (which passes through M) is transformed into the perpendicular bisector of A'B'.6. Step 5: Now, consider the quadrilateral A'B'DM. Since M is the midpoint of AB and D is the foot of the altitude from C to AB, A'B'DM is an isosceles trapezoid. The perpendicular bisector of A'B' is the symmetry axis of this trapezoid.7.

Identify the problem and the goal:   We need to find the largest real number ( C ) such that if the sum of the reciprocals of a set of integers greater than 1 is less than ( C ), then we can divide the set into no more than ( n ) groups, each with a sum of reciprocals less than 1.2.

To justify this, we need to show that if the sum of the reciprocals is less than ( frac{n+1}{2} ), then the set can be divided into ( n ) groups with each group having a sum of reciprocals less than 1.3. Construct a counterexample for ( C = frac{n+1}{2} ):   Consider ( n+1 ) instances of ( frac{1}{2} ). The sum of these reciprocals is:   [   sum_{i=1}^{n+1} frac{1}{2} = frac{n+1}{2}   ]   If we try to divide these ( n+1 ) instances into ( n ) groups, at least one group will contain at least two instances of ( frac{1}{2} ), making the sum of reciprocals in that group equal to 1, which violates the condition.4. Verify the upper bound:   Now, we need to show that if the sum of the reciprocals is less than ( frac{n+1}{2} ), we can indeed divide the set into ( n ) groups with each group having a sum of reciprocals less than 1.5. Proof by contradiction:   Suppose we have a set of integers whose sum of reciprocals is less than ( frac{n+1}{2} ), and we cannot divide them into ( n ) groups with each group having a sum of reciprocals less than 1. This means that at some point, we fail to place ( frac{1}{h} ) into any group because the sum in any group is at least ( 1 - frac{1}{h} ).6. Calculate the total sum:   If each group has a sum of at least ( 1 - frac{1}{h} ), then the total sum of the reciprocals in all groups is at least:   [   n left(1 - frac{1}{h}right) = n - frac{n}{h}   ]   Since ( h ) is an integer greater than 1, the smallest value for ( frac{n}{h} ) is ( frac{n}{2} ) when ( h = 2 ). Thus, the total sum is at least:   [   n - frac{n}{2} = frac{n}{2}   ]   However, this contradicts our assumption that the sum of the reciprocals is less than ( frac{n+1}{2} ).7. Conclusion:   Therefore, if the sum of the reciprocals is less than ( frac{n+1}{2} ), we can always divide the set into ( n ) groups with each group having a sum of reciprocals less than 1.The final answer is ( boxed{frac{n+1}{2}} )."},{"problem":"23.

For any tangent line of this circle to always intersect the ellipse at two points M and N and satisfy OM bot ON, we analyze the conditions for such intersections.Given the equation of the tangent line y = kx + m and the ellipse frac{x^2}{8} + frac{y^2}{4} = 1, we derive the quadratic equation in x:[(1+2k^2)x^2 + 4kmx + 2m^2 - 8 = 0]The discriminant Delta = 8(8k^2 - m^2 + 4) > 0 implies 8k^2 - m^2 + 4 > 0.For OM bot ON, we have x_1x_2 + y_1y_2 = 0, leading to:[frac{2m^2 - 8}{1 + 2k^2} + frac{m^2 - 8k^2}{1 + 2k^2} = 0]Solving this equation gives 3m^2 - 8k^2 - 8 = 0, which simplifies to 3m^2 - 8 = 8k^2. This implies m^2 geq frac{8}{3}.The radius of the circle is r = frac{|m|}{sqrt{1 + k^2}}, leading to r^2 = frac{m^2}{1 + k^2} = frac{8}{3}, so r = frac{2sqrt{6}}{3}.Therefore, the equation of the required circle is:[x^2 + y^2 = frac{8}{3}]boxed{x^2 + y^2 = frac{8}{3}}For tangent lines with undefined slope, the analysis confirms that the tangent lines intersect the ellipse at points satisfying OM cdot ON = 0.In conclusion, a circle with its center at the origin and equation x^2 + y^2 = frac{8}{3} exists under the given conditions."},{"problem":"Given a=2011^{0.6}, b=0.6^{2011}, c=log_{0.6}2011, the relationship among a, b, and c is ( )A: b<c<aB: b<a<cC: c<a<bD: c<b<a","solution":"From the properties of the logarithmic function, we can get: c=log_{0.6}20111, 0b>c.

Understanding the problem:   We need to find the last two digits of (A^{20}) where (A) is an even number not divisible by 10. This means (A) is not divisible by 2 and 5 simultaneously.2. Using Euler's Totient Theorem:   Euler's Totient Theorem states that (A^{phi(n)} equiv 1 pmod{n}) where (gcd(A, n) = 1). Here, we choose (n = 25) because we are interested in the last two digits, which can be found using modulo 100. Since (A) is even and not divisible by 10, (gcd(A, 25) = 1).3. Calculating (phi(25)):   [   phi(25) = 25 left(1 - frac{1}{5}right) = 25 cdot frac{4}{5} = 20   ]   Therefore, (A^{20} equiv 1 pmod{25}).4. Considering modulo 4:   Since (A) is even, (A equiv 0 pmod{4}). Therefore, (A^{20} equiv 0^{20} equiv 0 pmod{4}).5. Using the Chinese Remainder Theorem:   We now have the system of congruences:   [   begin{cases}   A^{20} equiv 1 pmod{25}    A^{20} equiv 0 pmod{4}   end{cases}   ]   We need to find a number (x) such that:   [   begin{cases}   x equiv 1 pmod{25}    x equiv 0 pmod{4}   end{cases}   ]6. Solving the system:   We can solve this system by checking numbers that satisfy (x equiv 1 pmod{25}) and also (x equiv 0 pmod{4}).

This is because the smallest value of 2alpha can be 0 (when alpha = 0), and the largest value can be pi (when alpha = frac{pi}{2}).

The collision number for the collision between the ground and the ball is k. For which balls is it useful to measure k with the bouncing time? (The collision number is the ratio of the mechanical energy after and before the collision.)","solution":"A ball dropped from a height of h_{0} has an initial mechanical energy of m g h_{0}, so after the n-th bounce, m g h_{n} = k^{n} cdot m g h_{0}. From this, the height to which the ball rises after the n-th bounce is:h_{n}=k^{n} h_{0}We know that the time of fall for a freely falling object from a height h is sqrt{2 h / g}. Thus, a ball thrown to a height h is in the air for 2 sqrt{2 h / g}. The total bouncing time is obtained by summing the calculated times between successive bounces, so:t=sqrt{frac{2 h_{0}}{g}}+sum_{n=1} 2 sqrt{frac{2 h_{n}}{g}}=sqrt{frac{2 h_{0}}{g}}+sum_{n=1} 2 sqrt{frac{2 h_{0}}{g}} cdot k^{n / 2}Using the formula for the sum of an infinite geometric series, we get:t=sqrt{frac{2 h_{0}}{g}}+2 sqrt{frac{2 h_{0}}{g}} frac{sqrt{k}}{1-sqrt{k}}=frac{1+sqrt{k}}{1-sqrt{k}} cdot sqrt{frac{2 h_{0}}{g}}If we want to measure k using the bouncing time, we can use the following formula derived from (1):k=left(frac{t-sqrt{frac{2 h_{0}}{g}}}{t+sqrt{frac{2 h_{0}}{g}}}right)^{2}To measure k accurately, the assumptions used in deriving the above relationships must be valid, so:1. the effect of air resistance should be small (this requires a ball with a high average density; the effect of air resistance is also small if the ball's speed is low or if h_{0} is relatively small);2. the collision time should be short (this requires a hard ball and a hard surface).

The radius r is frac{1}{2}|PQ| = frac{1}{2}sqrt{(1+1)^{2}+(-2)^{2}} = sqrt{2}.  Given N(3, 3),  we find |AN| = sqrt{3^{2}+(3+1)^{2}} = 5.  Thus, the maximum length of |MN| is 5+ sqrt{2}.  Therefore, the answer is boxed{5+ sqrt{2}}.  By utilizing the properties of an arithmetic sequence, we deduce 2b=a+c, and by rearranging, we find a-2b+c=0, which is a breakthrough in solving this problem. This problem examines the properties of arithmetic sequences, the equation of a line passing through a fixed point, the circle angle theorem, the midpoint coordinate formula, and the distance formula between two points."},{"problem":"Rectangular tiles, which measure 6 by 4 , are arranged without overlapping, to create a square.

(A simple graph is one where no vertex is connected to itself, and any two vertices are connected by at most one edge.)","solution":"Figure 1 is a simple graph with eight vertices and eleven edges, where there is no quadrilateral.Below we prove that 11 is the required maximum value. For this, it is sufficient to prove that a graph with twelve edges must contain a quadrilateral. First, we point out a few facts:(1) Suppose point A is connected to points A_{1}, A_{2}, cdots, A_{k}, and B is a vertex different from A (which can be one of the points in left{A_{1}, A_{2}, cdots, A_{k}right}). If B is connected to two points in left{A_{1}, A_{2}, cdots, A_{k}right}, then the graph contains a quadrilateral.(2) In a graph with four vertices, if there are five edges, there must be a quadrilateral.Let G be a simple graph with eight vertices and twelve edges. We will prove that G must contain a quadrilateral. We use proof by contradiction, i.e., assume G has no quadrilateral. Let d_{1}, d_{2}, cdots, d_{8} be the degrees of the eight vertices of G. Sincesum_{i=1}^{8} d_{i}=2 times 12=24, max left(d_{1}, d_{2}, cdots, d_{8}right) geqslant 3We will discuss the following three cases.i max left(d_{1}, d_{2}, cdots, d_{8}right)=3. In this case, the degree of each vertex in G is 3. Take any vertex A, and let the vertices connected to A be A_{1}, A_{2}, A_{3}, and the remaining four vertices be B_{1}, B_{2}, B_{3}, B_{4}. By (1), the number of edges between left{B_{1}, B_{2}, B_{3}, B_{4}right} and left{A_{1}, A_{2}, A_{3}right} is at most four. The number of edges between the vertices in left{A_{1}, A_{2}, A_{3}right} is at most one, so the number of edges between the vertices in left{B_{1}, B_{2}, B_{3}, B_{4}right} is at least 12-3-4-1=4 (by (2), there are also only four edges). We only consider these four vertices and the four edges connecting them. At this time, there must be a vertex with degree 1 (if the degree of these four points is all 2, it will form a quadrilateral). Thus, there is a vertex with degree 3, i.e., there must be a point (let's say B_{1}) in left{B_{1}, B_{2}, B_{3}, B_{4}right} that is connected to the other three points B_{2}, B_{3}, B_{4}. And the number of edges between the points in left{B_{1}, B_{2}, B_{3}, B_{4}right} and the points in left{A_{2}, A_{3}, A_{4}right} is 4, so B_{1} must be connected to one of the points in left{A_{2}, A_{3}, A_{4}right}. Thus, in the graph G, the degree of B_{1} will be 4, which contradicts the assumption.ii max left(d_{1}, cdots, d_{8}right)=4. Take a vertex A with degree 4, and let the vertices connected to A be A_{1}, A_{2}, A_{3}, A_{4}, and the remaining three vertices be B_{1}, B_{2}, B_{3}. By (1), the number of edges between the points in left{A_{1}, A_{2}, A_{3}, A_{4}right} is at most 2, the number of edges between the points in left{B_{1}, B_{2}, B_{3}right} and the points in left{A_{1}, A_{2}, A_{3}, A_{4}right} is at most 3, and the number of edges between the points in left{B_{1}, B_{2}, B_{3}right} is at most 3. Since the total number of edges is 12, the sum of the above edge numbers is 2,3,3. Therefore, the number of edges between the points in left{A_{1}, A_{2}, A_{3}, A_{4}right} is 2, let's say A_{1} A_{2} and A_{3} A_{4} (these two edges do not share a common vertex, otherwise a quadrilateral will appear). Each point in left{B_{1}, B_{2}, B_{3}right} is connected to one of the points in left{A_{1}, A_{2}, A_{3}, A_{4}right}, and B_{1} B_{2}, B_{1} B_{3}, B_{2} B_{3} are all edges in G. Since each point in left{B_{1}, B_{2}, B_{3}right} is connected to one of the points in left{A_{1}, A_{2}, A_{3}, A_{4}right}, at least two points are connected to one of the points in left{A_{1}, A_{2}right} or left{A_{3}, A_{4}right}, let's say left{B_{1}, B_{2}, B_{3}right} has two points B_{1}, B_{2} connected to one of the points in left{A_{1}, A_{2}right}.

For example, the number n=72 satisfies both conditions, since for it 2 n=144=12^{2} and 3 n=216=6^{3}.However, let's also see how we arrive at (the smallest suitable) number 72. Consider the prime factorization of the sought number n in the formn=2^{a_{2}} cdot 3^{a_{3}} cdot ldots cdot p^{a_{p}},where p is the largest prime dividing n, and the numbers a_{2}, ldots, a_{p} are non-negative integers. Then the number 2 n has the prime factorization2 n=2^{a_{2}+1} cdot 3^{a_{3}} cdot ldots cdot p^{a_{p}}.We note that this number is a square of a natural number if and only if all exponents a_{2}+1, a_{3}, ldots, a_{p} are even. The prime factorization of the number 3 n is3 n=2^{a_{2}} cdot 3^{a_{3}+1} cdot ldots cdot p^{a_{p}}.This number is a cube if and only if all exponents a_{2}, a_{3}+1, ldots, a_{p} are divisible by three. Therefore, the number n satisfies both conditions from the problem if and only if: the number a_{2} is odd and divisible by three, the number a_{3} is even and gives a remainder of 2 when divided by three, and finally, for each prime q>3, the number a_{q} is divisible by both two and three (i.e., it is divisible by six). We see that the exponents a_{2}=3 and a_{3}=2 are the smallest that satisfy the corresponding conditions, and at the same time in (1) we can choose p=3 (i.e., set a_{q}=0 for each q>3). This gives us the smallest possible n=2^{3} cdot 3^{2}=72, which satisfies the conditions of part a). At the same time, from our considerations, it follows that all suitable numbers n are of the formn=2^{6 a-3} cdot 3^{6 b-4} cdot M^{6}, quad text { or more simply } quad n=2^{3} cdot 3^{2} cdot N^{6},where a, b, M, N are positive integers (we can also assume that the number M is coprime with the number 6).b) We will prove by contradiction that such a number n does not exist. Its prime factorization (1) would have to satisfy the conditions determined in part a) of our solution and, in addition, the number4 n=2^{a_{2}+2} cdot 3^{a_{3}} cdot ldots cdot p^{a_{p}}would have to be a fourth power, i.e., all exponents a_{2}+2, a_{3}, ldots, a_{p} would have to be divisible by four. In particular, the number a_{2}+2 would have to be divisible by four, even though the number a_{2} is, as we know from the solution of part a), necessarily odd. This contradiction completes the proof of the non-existence of the number n.ANOTHER SOLUTION to part b) without considering prime factorizations: The sought number n must satisfy the equation 2 n=k^{2} for some natural k. Since sqrt{4 n}=sqrt{2 k^{2}}=k cdot sqrt{2} and the number sqrt{2} is known to be irrational, the radicand 4 n is not a square, and thus not a fourth power of a natural number.For a complete solution, award 6 points, 3 points for part a) and 3 points for part b).

Let A^{prime} be the set of remaining elements, A^{prime}=A backslash{m}={1,2, ldots, m-1, m+1, ldots, n}. The sum of the numbers in set A^{prime}, S^{prime}=S-m=frac{n(n+1)-2 m}{2}, and their mean, M^{prime}=frac{n(n+1)-2 m}{2(n-1)}.

We obtain frac{n+1}{2}-frac{n(n+1)-2 m}{2(n-1)}=frac{2 m-n-1}{2(n-1)}=frac{1}{2020}, from which n=frac{2020 m-1009}{1011}=frac{(2022 m-1011)-2(m-1)}{1011}=2 m-1-2 cdot frac{m-1}{1011}. Since n is a natural number, and (2,1011)=1, it follows that frac{m-1}{1011} must be a natural number. Let frac{m-1}{1011}=k, where k in mathrm{N}. Thus, m=1011 k+1. But then n=2(1011 k+1)-1-2 cdot k, that is, n=2020 k+1. Since m leq n, it follows that k>0, that is, k in mathrm{N}^{*}.Thus, in Case 1, the numbers n are all numbers of the form n=2020 k+1; the number removed from set A is m=1011 k+1.Case 2.

Therefore, one of the numbers n, n-1, n-2, n-3, n-4 must be divisible by 37; a multiple of 37 larger than 2 cdot 37 cannot appear among the five numbers because then binom{n}{5} would already be a number with more than 6 digits.If 2 cdot 37 appears among the factors, then n is at least 70, and thus binom{n}{5} geq binom{70}{5} = frac{70 cdot 69 cdot 68 cdot 67 cdot 66}{1 cdot 2 cdot 3 cdot 4 cdot 5} > frac{66 cdot 66 cdot 66 cdot 66 cdot 66}{1 cdot 2 cdot 3 cdot 4 cdot 5} > 10436104, but this is impossible because ababab < 1000000. Therefore, one of the numbers is 37.Among five consecutive numbers, one must also be divisible by 13. Let's find the number closest to 37 that is divisible by 13, which is 39. Other multiples of 13 are more than 5 units away from 37, so the three numbers among the five are: 39, 38, 37. The product of these three numbers is also divisible by 3, so one of the remaining two numbers must be divisible by 7. Among the numbers 41, 40, 36, and 35, only one is divisible by 7: 35. Therefore, the five numbers are: 39, 38, 37, 36, 35.Thus, if the problem has a solution, it can only be n = 39, and this is indeed a solution because binom{39}{5} = 575757."},{"problem":"Calculate:  (1)sqrt{48}×sqrt{frac{1}{3}}-sqrt{12}÷sqrt{2}+sqrt{24};  (2)(-3)^{0}+|sqrt{2}-2|-(frac{1}{3})^{-1}+sqrt{8}.","solution":" Problem 1:Calculate:  (1)sqrt{48}×sqrt{frac{1}{3}}-sqrt{12}÷sqrt{2}+sqrt{24}.

For our equation, the denominator of the x^2 term is positive, while the denominator of the y^2 term is negative, suggesting opposite signs and confirming that it must be a hyperbola.2. To further classify this hyperbola, we consider the denominators of the squared terms. The standard equation for a hyperbola centered at the origin with its transverse axis (the axis along the foci) along the x-axis is given by:    frac{x^2}{a^2} - frac{y^2}{b^2} = 1    In this case, since the x^2 term has a positive coefficient and the y^2 term has a negative coefficient, the hyperbola opens along the x-axis.

The distance between M and the center C is |MC|= sqrt {5}.Since N is a moving point on curve C, the maximum distance between M and N occurs when N is on the same side of the center as M and is on the circumference of the circle.

Let (x, y) be any solution of the given system. Since sqrt{sqrt{x}+2} is obviously positive, we have y>2 by the first equation. Similarly, the second equation implies x>2.Now we prove that the numbers x and y must be equal.* We will use the observation that the function square root is increasing.

For each such s, we square the equality to obtain s+2=left(s^{2}-2right)^{2}, which we rewrite in the form s^{4}-4 s^{2}-s+2=0. Note that this equation has a root s=2.

Indeed, for every s>sqrt{2}, s^{3}+2 s^{2}-1>0 (this is even true for s geq 1 ). The only satisfactory value of s=2 corresponds to the only solution x=s^{2}=4 of the equation (1), and therefore to the only solution x=y=4 of the given problem.[^2]Conclusion. The given system of equations has a unique solution (x, y)=(4,4).REMARK. Let us give a second possible derivation of x=y.We begin the new proof of the equality x=y by taking squares of both equationsbegin{aligned}& sqrt{x}+2=(y-2)^{2}, & sqrt{y}+2=(x-2)^{2} .end{aligned}By subtracting the second equation from the first we getbegin{aligned}sqrt{x}-sqrt{y} & =(y-2)^{2}-(x-2)^{2}=((y-2)-(x-2))((y-2)+(x-2))= & =(y-x)(x+y-4)=(sqrt{y}-sqrt{x})(sqrt{y}+sqrt{x})(x+y-4) .end{aligned}Assuming that x neq y, after dividing the two outer expressions by sqrt{y}-sqrt{x} neq 0, we get-1=(sqrt{y}+sqrt{x})(x+y-4) .However, as we know, both x and y are greater than 2 , so the right-hand side of the last equation is positive, which is a contradiction.ANOTHER SOLUtion. We again use the observation that both numbers x and y are greater than 2, and introduce the function f:(2, infty) rightarrow(2, infty), f(t)=sqrt{t}+2 for every t>2. The equations from the problem, rewritten in the formbegin{aligned}& sqrt{sqrt{x}+2}+2=y & sqrt{sqrt{y}+2}+2=xend{aligned}can then be written as a system of equations using the function fbegin{aligned}& f(f(x))=y, & f(f(y))=x .end{aligned}We see that its solutions are just pairs of the form (x, y)=(x, f(f(x))), where the number x satisfies the relation f(f(f(f(x))))=x. This is certainly satisfied in the case where f(x)=x. We show that the equality holds only in this case.If f(x)x we have*f(f(f(f(x))))>f(f(f(x)))>f(f(x))>f(x)>x .Thus, we have proved equivalence of f(f(f(f(x))))=x and f(x)=x.It remains to solve the equation f(x)=x with unknown x>2, which is easy:f(x)=x Leftrightarrow sqrt{x}+2=x Leftrightarrow 0=(sqrt{x}-2)(sqrt{x}+1) Leftrightarrow sqrt{x}=2 Leftrightarrow x=4 text {. }We arrive at the same conclusion as in the first solution.[^3]REMARK. The reasoning about the function f from the second solution can also be used to solve equation (1) from the first solution without considering the fourth degree equation.

To find the midpoint, we calculate:h = dfrac{x_1 + x_2}{2} = dfrac{-4 + 0}{2} = -2 k = dfrac{y_1 + y_2}{2} = dfrac{3 + 0}{2} = dfrac{3}{2}Thus, the center of the circle is at (-2, frac{3}{2}).Next, we determine the length of the diameter using the distance formula:AB = sqrt{(-4 - 0)^2 + (0 - 3)^2} = sqrt{16 + 9} = sqrt{25} = 5Since the diameter AB is 5, the radius r is half of that, which means r = frac{5}{2}.Now that we know the center and radius, the equation of the circle is:(x - h)^2 + (y - k)^2 = r^2 (x + 2)^2 + left(y - frac{3}{2}right)^2 = left(frac{5}{2}right)^2 (x + 2)^2 + left(y - frac{3}{2}right)^2 = frac{25}{4}Expanding and simplifying this equation, we get:x^2 + 4x + 4 + y^2 - 3y + frac{9}{4} = frac{25}{4} x^2 + 4x + y^2 - 3y + 4 + frac{9}{4} - frac{25}{4} = 0 x^2 + 4x + y^2 - 3y = 0Therefore, the general equation of the circle is boxed{x^2 + 4x + y^2 - 3y = 0}."},{"problem":"Simplify first, then evaluate: (a-frac{a^{2}}{a^{2}-1})÷frac{a^{2}}{a^{2}-1}, where the value of a is chosen as an appropriate integer from the solution set of the inequality -1 lt a lt sqrt{5}.","solution":"To simplify and then evaluate the expression (a-frac{a^{2}}{a^{2}-1})÷frac{a^{2}}{a^{2}-1} given the value of a from the solution set of the inequality -1  -1).Substituting a = 2 into the simplified expression:begin{align*}frac{a^{2}-a-1}{a} &= frac{2^{2}-2-1}{2} &= frac{4-2-1}{2} &= frac{1}{2}.end{align*}Therefore, the simplified and evaluated expression is boxed{frac{1}{2}}."},{"problem":"Given the power function f(x) = x^a whose graph passes through the point (3, frac{sqrt{3}}{3}), find the value of f(9).","solution":"From the given information, we have f(3) = 3^a = frac{sqrt{3}}{3} = 3^{-frac{1}{2}}.

This is because there are 5 outcomes for a 4 to appear on the first die and a different number on the second die, and 5 outcomes for a 4 to appear on the second die and a different number on the first die.Therefore, P(B|A) = frac{10}{30} = frac{1}{3}.So, the answer is: boxed{frac{1}{3}}.This problem is a model of conditional probability.

Find the largest possible value of n.(A. Antropov)","solution":"Answer: 160.Solution: Estimation. We will prove that n>160 \\"does not work\\". Let us have a set of n candies. We will call a flavor critical if there are exactly 10 candies of this flavor (among all the given n candies). Let us have k critical flavors, then the total number of candies is not less than 10k: n geqslant 10k. Remove one candy of each critical flavor and organize a group from the remaining n-k candies. For this group, there is no flavor represented by exactly 10 candies. Moreover, n-k geqslant n-frac{n}{10}=frac{9 n}{10}>frac{9 cdot 160}{10}=144. Thus, the considered group contains at least 145 candies, so the condition of the problem is not satisfied.Example. Now let us provide an example of a situation where Vasya can have 160 candies. Suppose he has exactly 10 candies of each of 16 flavors. Let a group be chosen for which there is no flavor represented by exactly 10 candies. Then this group does not include at least one candy of each flavor (in other words, no flavor is taken completely), i.e., the group contains no more than 16 cdot 9=144 candies, so the condition of the problem is satisfied.Remark 1. The estimate n leqslant 160 can also be proven in a slightly different way. Suppose that some n=145+m \\"works\\", i.e., there exists a set K_{0} of n candies that satisfies the condition of the problem. Then in the set K_{0} there are exactly 10 candies of some flavor A_{0}. Remove the candy a_{0} of flavor A_{0} and consider the group K_{1} of the remaining n-1 candies. In the group K_{1} there are exactly 10 candies of some flavor A_{1}, which is different from A_{0}, since K_{1} has exactly 9 candies of flavor A_{0}. Remove from K_{1} the candy a_{1} of flavor A_{1} and consider the group K_{2} of the remaining n-2 candies, in which we will find 10 candies of a new flavor A_{3}, and so on, continue to remove one candy at a time and consider the groups of remaining candies. Thus, we will reach the group K_{m}, consisting of left|K_{m}right|=145 candies. According to our algorithm, K_{0} contains 10 candies of flavors A_{0}, ldots, A_{m}, so left|K_{0}right| geqslant 10(m+1).

However, 1 leqslant j-i leqslant 5, so (j-i) p is one of the numbers p, 2 p, 3 p, 4 p, 5 p, which, by the condition, should be a six-digit number, leading to a contradiction.Since each leading digit belongs to the set M, these six leading digits exactly form the set M. Thus, the digits of p are all distinct and do not include 0.Similarly, the last digits of these six numbers are also distinct (otherwise, if two numbers i p and j p have the same last digit, then the last digit of their difference is 0, and (j-i) p is one of the numbers p, 2 p, 3 p, 4 p, 5 p, leading to a contradiction).Therefore, the last digit of p must be odd (otherwise, if the last digit of p is even, then the last digit of 5 p is 0, which is a contradiction), and this last digit f neq 5 (otherwise, the last digit of 2 p would be 0, which is a contradiction).Since 6 p is still a six-digit number, we know that the leading digit of p, a=1 (if the leading digit of p, a geqslant 2, then 6 p would be a seven-digit number, contradicting the condition). Hence, f neq 1.Thus, f in {3, 7, 9}.We will discuss each case separately.If f=3, then the last digits of the six numbers p, 2 p, 3 p, 4 p, 5 p, 6 p are 3, 6, 9, 2, 5, 8, respectively, all belonging to the setM={3, 6, 9, 2, 5, 8},These six digits should also be the six digits of p, but in this case, S(p) = 33 is not a multiple of 9, leading to a contradiction.If f=9, then the last digits of the six numbers p, 2 p, 3 p, 4 p, 5 p, 6 p are 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, respectively, all belonging to the setM={9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4},These six digits should also be the six digits of p, but in this case, S(p) = 39, which is not a multiple of 9, leading to a contradiction.Therefore, only f=7.Thus, the last digits of the six numbers p, 2 p, 3 p, 4 p, 5 p, 6 p are 7, 4, 1, 8, 5, 2.Hence, the set M={7, 4, 1, 8, 5, 2}.We already have a=1 and f=7, so p=overline{1 b c d e 7}.Thus, b in {2, 4, 5, 8}.The leading digits of p, 2 p, 3 p, 4 p, 5 p, 6 p should be the increasing sequence of numbers in M, i.e., 1, 2, 4, 5, 7, 8.If b geqslant 5, then the leading digit of 2 p will be greater than 2, leading to a contradiction. Hence, b in {2, 4}.If b=2, then p leqslant 128547, and in this case, the leading digit of 5 p is no more than 6, leading to a contradiction.Thus, only b=4, giving p=overline{14 c d e 7}.Thus, e in {2, 5, 8}.If e=2, i.e., p=overline{14 c d 27}, then the second last digit (tens place) of 4 p is 0, and 0 notin M;If e=8, i.e., p=overline{14 c d 87}, then the second last digit (tens place) of 3 p is 6, and 6 notin M.Therefore, only e=5, giving p=overline{14 c d 57}, where {c, d}={2, 8}. In this case, only p=148257 or p=142857 are possible.If p=148257, then 2 p=296514, and the digits 6, 9 notin M.Thus, the only possible six-digit number p in this problem is p=142857.It is easy to verify that it satisfies the conditions of the problem."},{"problem":"1.

Since y = 2t, we have t = frac{y}{2}. Substituting this into x = t^2 gives x = left(frac{y}{2}right)^2 = frac{y^2}{4}. Multiplying both sides by 4 gives y^2 = 4x.2.

Nor can they be incident to the same vertex, for then the opposite face would again be equilateral.Hence we may name the tetrahedron (ABCD) in such a way that (AB = BC = CD = s).

Initial and Final Positions:   - Starting position: (1,1), so x + y = 2.   - Ending position: (8,8), so x + y = 16.   - We need to increase the sum from 2 to 16, which is an increase of 14.4. Calculating the Minimum Number of Moves:   - To achieve a total increase of 14, we need to consider the possible changes in the sum (x + y) per move.   - The smallest number of moves to get a sum at least as big as 14 is calculated by considering the maximum change per move, which is 3.   - If each move added 3, then the minimum number of moves would be lceil frac{14}{3} rceil = 5 moves.   - However, since 14 is not a multiple of 3, we need at least one additional move to adjust the sum to exactly 14.5. Adjusting for Modulo 3:   - The sum 14 modulo 3 is 2.   - We need to ensure that the total number of moves results in a sum that is congruent to 2 modulo 3.   - Since 5 moves would result in a sum that is a multiple of 3, we need one more move to adjust the sum to 14.6. Conclusion:   - Therefore, the minimum number of moves required is 6.The final answer is boxed{6}."},{"problem":"3.

In this case, we have 5 scores, which means the median is the 3rd score from either end. Adjusting the highest score by decreasing it by 1 point does not affect the position or value of the median, as the median is the 3rd value in the sequence. Therefore, the median remains unchanged.  This aligns with the question's premise that one of the statistical measures will not be affected. Hence, this statement is correct.- Option B: Variance  Variance measures how far each number in the set is from the mean and thus is affected by changes in any individual score. Lowering the highest score by 1 point changes the mean and the deviation of each score from the mean, thus affecting the variance. Therefore, the variance will change.  This does not align with the question's premise that one of the statistical measures will not be affected. Hence, this statement is incorrect.- Option C: Mode  The mode is the value that appears most frequently in a data set. Changing one score, especially the highest score (assuming it's unique), does not necessarily affect the frequency of other scores unless the highest score was the mode and its change creates a new frequency distribution. However, since the scores are all different integers, the mode, if it exists, is not dependent on the highest score alone. The mode may or may not change, but it's not guaranteed to remain unaffected.  This does not align perfectly with the question's premise, making this statement less likely to be correct.- Option D: Mean  The mean (average) is calculated by summing all scores and dividing by the number of scores. Decreasing the highest score by 1 point lowers the total sum of scores, which in turn lowers the mean. Therefore, the mean will change.  This does not align with the question's premise that one of the statistical measures will not be affected. Hence, this statement is incorrect.Given the analysis above, the statistical measure that will definitely not be affected by mistakenly recording the highest score as 1 point lower is the median.Therefore, the correct answer is boxed{A}."},{"problem":"Given the imaginary number z satisfies 2z - overline{z} = 1 + 6i, find |z|.","solution":"Let z = a + bi, then overline{z} = a - bi.Since the imaginary number z satisfies 2z - overline{z} = 1 + 6i,we have 2(a + bi) - (a - bi) = 1 + 6i,which simplifies to a + 3bi = 1 + 6i.Therefore, a = 1 and 3b = 6,which means a = 1 and b = 2.Thus, |z| = sqrt{5}.So, the answer is: boxed{sqrt{5}}This solution involves setting up the complex number, writing the conjugate of the complex number, substituting the set values into the equation, combining like terms, writing in the standard form of a complex number, using the necessary and sufficient condition for the equality of complex numbers to find the values of a and b, and thus obtaining the result.This problem requires organizing the given complex number expression, expanding the operation to get it in the form of a + bi, mainly based on the condition of equality of complex numbers.

Find all real-valued functions f defined on the positive reals such that f(x) f(y) = y h f(x/2) + x k f(y/2) for all x, y. Solution","solution":": f(x) = 0 is always a solution. If h = k, then there is an additional solution f(x) = 2(x/2) h . Consider first the case h = k. Putting x = y, f(x) 2 = 2x h f(x/2), so f(x/2) = x -h f(x) 2 /2. Hence f(x) f(y) = (y/x) h f(x) 2 /2 + (x/y) h f(y) 2 or ( (y/x) h/2 f(x) - (x/y) h/2 f(y) ) 2 = 0. So f(x)/x h = f(y)/y h . This is true for all x, y, so we have f(x) = A x h for some constant A. Substituting back into the original equation gives A 2 = A/2 h + A/2 h , so A = 0 or A = 2 1-h . Checking, it is clear that A = 0, corresponding to f(x) = 0, is a solution. If A = 2 1-h , then f(x) = 2 (x/2) h . The lhs of the original equation then becomes 4 (x/2) h (y/2) h , and the rhs becomes y h 2 (x/4) h + x h 2 (y/4) h = 4 (x/2) h (y/2) h = lhs. So it is indeed a solution. Now consider h and k unequal. We have f(x) f(y) = y h f(x/2) + x k f(y/2) and f(y) f(x) = x h f(y/2) + y k f(x/2). Subtracting, 0 = (y h - y k ) f(x/2) - (x h - x k ) f(y/2). So f(x/2) = A (x h - x k ) for some constant A for all x except possibly x = 1. Substituting back in the original equation, we get A 2 ( (2x) h - (2x) k )( (2y) h - (2y) k ) = A(x h - x k ) y h + A(y h - y k ) x k , except possibly for x or y = 1/2 or 1. Comparing coefficients, 4 h A 2 = A, 4 k A 2 = -A. So A = 0, and hence f(x) = 0 for all x except possibly 1/2 and 1. So, in particular f(2) = 0. Putting x = y = 2 in the original equation gives: 0 = (2 h + 2 k ) f(1), so f(1) = 0 also. Similarly, putting x = y = 1 in the original equation gives f(1/2) = 0.

Since A is a finite set, according to the extreme principle, take the longest good permutation in it, and assume that this good permutation is an l-element good permutation c_{1}, c_{2}, cdots, c_{l}. We want to prove that l=n.(1) If l=n, then the conclusion is proved.(2) If l0 Rightarrow c_{l+2}+c_{l+3}+cdots+c_{n}>0 .end{array}Let t be the smallest t such that c_{t}+c_{t+1}+cdots+c_{n}>0. Then c_{t}, c_{t}+c_{t+1}, cdots, c_{t}+c_{t+1}+cdots+c_{n-1} are all positive. Hence, c_{t}, c_{t+1}, cdots, c_{n} is an (n-t+1)-element good permutation. Therefore, c_{t}, c_{t+1}, cdots, c_{n}, c_{1}, c_{2}, cdots, c_{l} is a good permutation longer than l, which is a contradiction (if c_{t}, c_{t+1}, cdots, c_{n} overlaps with c_{1}, c_{2}, cdots, c_{l}, then removing the overlapping terms from c_{1}, c_{2}, cdots, c_{l} still results in a good permutation longer than l). Therefore, l=n.In summary, a circular permutation corresponds to at least one good permutation, and different circular permutations correspond to different good permutations. Therefore, the number of good permutations is at least (n-1)!."},{"problem":"Problem 5.

Note that in any representation of 2004 as a sum of approximately equal addends, the sum contains at most two different addends.We will prove that for every integer k from 1 to 2004, there exists a unique representation of 2004 as a sum of k approximately equal addends.To represent 2004 as a sum of k numbers, where x numbers are equal to m and y are equal to m+1 (where x+y=k and let x>0), the equation2004 = mx + (m+1)y = mk + ymust be satisfied, where 0 leq y < k. From this, y is uniquely determined - it is the remainder when 2004 is divided by k, and then x = k - y.Therefore, the representations are a total of 2004.Second method. We will prove by induction that the number N can be represented as a sum of approximately equal addends in N ways.Note that in any such representation, at most two different addends are involved.For the number 1, there is one representation: with one addend 1.Assume the statement is proven for some number N. By adding one unit to one of the smaller addends in each representation of N (or to any one if all are equal), we obtain a representation of the number N+1 (with the same number of addends). In this way, different representations of N yield different representations of N+1.Conversely, if in each representation of N+1 (except the representation as a sum of N+1 units) one of the larger addends is reduced by 1 (or, if the addends are equal, any one is reduced by 1), a representation of N is obtained (with the same number of addends). In this way, different representations of N+1 yield different representations of N.Therefore, the number of representations of the number N+1 is one greater than the number of representations of N.

Label the vertices 1,2, ldots, 2 n. Consider a graph where each vertex with an even label is connected to every vertex with a label smaller than its own, and these are the only edges. This graph has 2 n-1+ 2 n-3+ldots+3+1=n^{2} edges.The matching M given by {{1,2},{3,4}, ldots,{2 n-1,2 n}} is a perfect matching in this graph. Furthermore, notice that every perfect matching must include {2 n-1,2 n} as a pair, since vertex 2 n-1 has no other neighbors. Similarly, we conclude that 2 n-3 must be paired with 2 n-2 because its only remaining neighbor, 2 n, is already paired. By the same logic, for every k leqslant n, vertex 2 k-1 must be paired with vertex 2 k. Therefore, M is the unique perfect matching in the graph.Now, we prove that a graph with more than n^{2} edges cannot have a unique perfect matching.

In either case, we get a different matching from the initial one by replacing the edges {2 a-1,2 a} and {2 b-1,2 b} with these edges, which is a contradiction. Therefore, there are at most two edges between {2 a-1,2 a} and {2 b-1,2 b}.Now, let's count the edges.

Identify the roots and use Vieta's formulas:   - For the polynomial (x^3 + ax + b), we know that (-20) is a root. Let the other roots be (m + sqrt{n}i) and (m - sqrt{n}i) (since complex roots come in conjugate pairs).   - The sum of the roots of (x^3 + ax + b = 0) is zero (since the coefficient of (x^2) is zero). Therefore:     [     -20 + (m + sqrt{n}i) + (m - sqrt{n}i) = 0     ]     Simplifying, we get:     [     -20 + 2m = 0 implies 2m = 20 implies m = 10     ]2.

The other roots are (10 + sqrt{n}i) and (10 - sqrt{n}i).   - The sum of the roots of (x^3 + cx^2 + d = 0) is (-c). Therefore:     [     -21 + (10 + sqrt{n}i) + (10 - sqrt{n}i) = -c     ]     Simplifying, we get:     [     -21 + 10 + 10 = -c implies -1 = -c implies c = 1     ]3.

Therefore:     [     (-21) cdot (10 + sqrt{n}i) cdot (10 - sqrt{n}i) = -d     ]     Simplifying, we get:     [     (-21) cdot (10^2 - (sqrt{n}i)^2) = -d     ]     [     (-21) cdot (100 - (-n)) = -d     ]     [     (-21) cdot (100 + n) = -d     ]     [     21 cdot (100 + n) = d     ]4.

Let the number of books priced at 34 Ft be x, the number of books priced at 17.50 Ft be y, then the number of books priced at 27.50 Ft is 109-x-y, and according to the bill, after rearrangement,begin{gathered}34 x+17.5 y+27.5(109-x-y)=2845 6.5 x-10 y=-152.5 x=frac{20 y-305}{13}=y-23+frac{7 y-6}{13}end{gathered}x and y are natural numbers, so the third term on the right side must be a natural number u:frac{7 y-6}{13}=u, text { from which } y=frac{13 u+6}{7}=2 u+1-frac{u+1}{7}and repeating this thought process,begin{aligned}& frac{u+1}{7}=v, text { an integer, from which } u=7 v-1, text { and furthermore } & qquad begin{array}{l}y=2 u+1-v=13 v-1 x=y-23+u=20 v-25end{array}end{aligned}finally, the number of books priced at 27.50 Ft is z=135-33 v.We only get a positive integer for x if v is at least 2; however, z remains positive only as long as v is not greater than 4, so only 2, 3, and 4 can be used for v andbegin{aligned}& v=2 text { in which case } & x=15 & y=25 & z=69 text {, } quad & v=3 quad \\" quad x=35 & y=38 & z=36 & v=4 quad \\" & x=55 & y=51 & z=3end{aligned}Only the set of values derived from v=3 meets the final requirement of the problem, according to which they bought 35 books priced at 34 Ft, 38 books priced at 27.50 Ft, and 36 books priced at 17.50 Ft.János Bárdos (Makó, József A. g. I. o. t.)II. Solution. Using the same notation as in the first solution and a similar thought process, we arrive at the following equation:33 x+20 z=1875The first term on the left side is divisible by 3, the second term by 5, and the right side by both. Since 3 and 5 are relatively prime numbers, this is only possible if x is a multiple of 5 and z is a multiple of 3: x=5 t, z=3 s, where t and s are natural numbers. Substituting these into (1) and simplifying,11 t+4 s=125The right side is odd, but 4 s is even, so 11t, and thus t itself, must be odd: t=2 r-1, where r is a natural number. Substituting this into (2) and rearranging,11 r+2 s=68Here, however, r can only be even, r=2 q ( q is a natural number), from which s=34-11 q.Accordingly, only q=1,2,3 meet the requirement, from which r=2,4,6 ; t=3,7,11 ; x=15,35,55; and s=23,12,1 ; z=69,36,3. From here, using the thought process of the first solution, we arrive at the result.III. Solution. Start from the last statement of the problem. The average price of the books is (34+27.50+17.50) / 3=79 / 3, which is almost exactly 36th of the spent amount, so by taking 36 of each type of book, we would spend 36(34+27.5+17.5)=2844 mathrm{Ft}, leaving us with 1 Ft and we would still need to buy one more book. We need to ensure at least 16.50 Ft for the cover of the last book, which is only possible by exchanging a more expensive book for a cheaper one. The difference between the highest and lowest unit price is exactly 16.50 mathrm{Ft}, so instead of 1 book priced at 34 Ft, we can buy 2 books priced at 17.50 Ft, using the 1 Ft remainder, the money runs out, and we have the desired 109 books.We cannot get a solution with fewer exchanges, so according to the prices in descending order, they bought 35, 36, and 38 books.Ottó Dobozi (Budapest, Apáczai Csere J. gyak. g. I. o. t.)Note. Many papers stated that for the books priced at 27.50 Ft and 17.50 Ft, which include cents, we must buy an even number of each to use the whole amount of forints. - This is incorrect. It is true that y+z is even and x is odd, but this does not make the solution unique."},{"problem":"Given tan (frac{pi}{4} + alpha) = 3, compute:(1) tan alpha;(2) tan 2alpha;(3) frac{2sin alphacos alpha + 3cos 2alpha}{5cos 2alpha - 3sin 2alpha}.","solution":"(1) Since tan (frac{pi}{4} + alpha) = frac{tan alpha + 1}{1 - tan alpha} = 3, solving for tan alpha, we obtain tan alpha = frac{1}{2}.(2) Using the double angle formula for tangent, tan 2alpha = frac{2tan alpha}{1 - tan^2 alpha} = frac{2 times frac{1}{2}}{1 - (frac{1}{2})^2} = boxed{frac{4}{3}}.(3) First, use the double angle identities for sine and cosine to simplify the numerator and denominator: frac{2sin alphacos alpha + 3cos 2alpha}{5cos 2alpha - 3sin 2alpha} = frac{sin 2alpha + 3cos 2alpha}{5cos 2alpha - 3sin 2alpha}.

Determine all exponents k for whichvarphileft(sigmaleft(2^{k}right)right)=2^{k}holds. (As a hint, we reveal that 641 is a divisor of left(2^{32}+1right).Solution. Let the prime factorization of n be p_{1}^{alpha_{1}} cdot p_{2}^{alpha_{2}} cdot ldots cdot p_{s}^{alpha_{s}}, where p_{1}, p_{2}, ldots, p_{s} are distinct primes, and alpha_{1}, ldots, alpha_{s} are positive integers. Thenvarphi(n)=p_{1}^{alpha_{1}-1}left(p_{1}-1right) cdot ldots cdot p_{s}^{alpha_{s}-1}left(p_{s}-1right)(see, for example, Molnár Emil: Matematikai versenyfeladatok, 490. p.). If now n is odd and varphi(n)=2^{k}, then (2) can only hold if, on the one hand, alpha_{1}=alpha_{2}=alpha_{s}=ldots=1 (since p_{i} is odd), and on the other hand, p_{i}-1=2^{beta_{i}} for some positive integer beta_{i}. We know that 2^{beta_{i}}+1 can only be a prime if beta_{i} itself is a power of two, and such numbers are called Fermat primes. We have thus obtained thatn=left(2^{beta_{1}}+1right)left(2^{beta_{2}}+1right) ldotsleft(2^{beta_{s}}+1right)where beta_{i}=2^{gamma_{i}}, 0 leqq gamma_{1}<gamma_{2}<ldots<gamma_{s}, and 2^{beta_{i}}+1 is a prime. Performing the multiplication in (3),n=1+2^{beta_{1}}+2^{beta_{2}}+2^{beta_{1}+beta_{2}}+ldots+2^{beta_{s}}+2^{beta_{s}+beta_{1}}+ldots+2^{beta_{s}+ldots+beta_{1}}Here, a total of 2^{s} terms appear, and since the beta_{i} are distinct powers of two, the exponents are all different. This means that in the binary representation of n, 1s appear in the 0th, beta_{1}-th, beta_{2}-th, ldotsleft(beta_{1}+beta_{2}+ldots+beta_{s}right)-th positions from the right, and 0s in all other positions.Now let's return to the (1) equation. Since the divisors of 2^{k} are 1,2,2^{2}, ldots, 2^{k}, thenn=sigmaleft(2^{k}right)=1+2+2^{2}+ldots+2^{k}is an odd number, whose binary representation has 1s in the last k+1 positions. Therefore, varphi(n)=2^{k} can only hold if n can also be written in the form (4). And since a number can only be written in one way in binary, this means that the numbers beta_{1}<beta_{2}<beta_{1}+beta_{2}<ldots beta_{1}+beta_{2}+ldots+beta_{s} must match the numbers 1, 2, ldots, k. This is only possible if beta_{1}=2^{0}, beta_{2}=2^{1}, ldots, beta_{s}=2^{s-1}, ldots, and k=2^{s}-1. At the same time, 2^{beta_{i}}+1=2^{2^{i-1}}+1 must be a prime for every 1 leqq i leqq s. According to the hint given in the problem, 2^{32}+1=2^{2^{5}}+1 is not a prime, so only the cases s=1,2,3,4 and 5 are possible, i.e., the possible values of k are 1,3,7,15 and 31. And since 2^{2^{i-1}}+1 is a prime if i leqq 5, these values of k indeed satisfy (1)."},{"problem":"1.61.

Take mathrm{m} consecutive rows (including row mathrm{R}), and their union U contains exactly mathrm{m} rooks. At this point, consider the columns from the 2nd to the mathrm{m}^{2}+1(leq mathrm{n}) column in set mathrm{U}. This mathrm{m} times mathrm{m}^{2} rectangle can be divided into mathrm{m} mathrm{m} times mathrm{m} squares, but there are at most mathrm{m}-1 rooks in it (since set U already has one rook in the 1st column), thus, among these mathrm{m} mathrm{m} times mathrm{m} squares, at least one is empty.(2) For the case of n=m^{2}, first construct a peaceful placement scheme without any empty mathrm{m} times mathrm{m} square. Label all rows from bottom to top as 0, 1, 2, ldots, mathrm{~m}^{2}-1, and label all columns from left to right as 0, 1, 2, ldots, m^{2}-1, and denote the unit square in the mathrm{r}-th row and mathrm{c}-th column as (mathrm{r}, mathrm{c}).Place a rook in each unit square of the form (mathrm{i} cdot mathrm{m}+mathrm{j}, mathrm{j} cdot mathrm{m}+mathrm{i})(mathrm{i}, mathrm{j}=0, 1, ldots, m-1). Since each number from 0 to m^{2}-1 has a unique representation of the form i cdot m+j (in fact, it is the m-ary representation, (ij) )_{m}=mathrm{i} cdot mathrm{m}+mathrm{j}), there is exactly one rook in each row and each column. We prove that at this point, each mathrm{m} times mathrm{m} square contains at least one rook.At this point, for any mathrm{m} times mathrm{m} square mathrm{A}, let the label of the lowest row of square mathrm{A} be mathrm{pm}+mathrm{q}, then the mathrm{m} rows of square mathrm{A} contain mathrm{m} rooks, and the labels of the columns where these mathrm{m} rooks are located are mathrm{qm}+mathrm{p}, mathrm{q}(mathrm{m}+1)+mathrm{p}, ldots, (m-1) m+p, 0 cdot m+(p+1), 1 cdot m+(p+1), ldots, (q-1) m+(p+1). Arrange these numbers in ascending order:p+1, m+(p+1), ldots, (q-1) m+(p+1), q m+p, (q+1) m+p, ldots, (m-1) m+pThe difference between any two adjacent numbers in this sequence does not exceed mathrm{m}, the first number does not exceed mathrm{m}-1 (if mathrm{p}=mathrm{m}-1, then mathrm{q}=0, so the first number will be mathrm{qm}+mathrm{p}=mathrm{m}-1), and the last number is not less than mathrm{m}(mathrm{m}-1). Therefore, at least one of the labels of the mathrm{m} columns of square mathrm{A} appears in this sequence, indicating that square mathrm{A} contains at least one rook.For the case of mathrm{n}<mathrm{m}^{2}, construct a peaceful placement scheme without any empty mathrm{m} times mathrm{m} square.For this, consider the construction of the mathrm{m}^{2} times mathrm{m}^{2} case as described above, and delete the last mathrm{m}^{2}-mathrm{n} columns and the top mathrm{m}^{2}-mathrm{n} rows, resulting in an mathrm{n} times mathrm{n} square, and there are no empty mathrm{m} times mathrm{m} squares in it. However, some rows and columns may be empty, but obviously, the number of empty rows is equal to the number of empty columns, so they can be paired one-to-one, and then place a rook at the intersection of the corresponding empty rows and columns, thus obtaining a peaceful placement scheme of mathrm{n} rooks on an mathrm{n} times mathrm{n} chessboard, and there are no empty mathrm{m} times mathrm{m} squares in it.In summary, the maximum value sought is mathrm{k}_{max }=[sqrt{mathrm{n}-1}]."},{"problem":"4.

This is because the perimeter of triangle B A_{1} C is greater than 2 B C=4.Assume the convex n+2-gon B A_{1} A_{2} cdots A_{n} C satisfies the condition.Since A_{n} B + A_{n} C + B C > 4, we can choose a point A_{n+1} sufficiently close to point C on the minor arc overparen{C A}_{n}, such that A_{n} B + A_{n} A_{n+1} + B A_{n+1} > 4 still holds.

The internal angles of a convex hexagon measure whole degrees and form an arithmetic sequence. Let alpha be the largest angle of this hexagon.

Let a_{1} be the smallest angle, and we use the formula for the sum of 6 terms of an arithmetic sequence s_{6}=frac{nleft(2 a_{1}+(n-1) dright)}{2}, along with the information about the sum of the interior angles of a hexagon 6 cdot 180^{circ}-360^{circ}=720^{circ}. We write the equation frac{6left(2 a_{1}+5 dright)}{2}=720, from which we get 2 a_{1}+5 d=240 and then a_{1}=frac{240-5 d}{2}=120-frac{5 d}{2}. The number d is positive, and from the last relationship between a_{1} and d, we conclude that it is even. The largest angle of the hexagon is a_{6}=a_{1}+5 d. By trial and verification, we determine that the largest angle of such a hexagon can measure 175^{circ}.We can solve the problem differently. In a regular hexagon, all angles are 120^{circ}. If each angle of the hexagon measures an integer number of degrees and the angles form an arithmetic sequence, the middle angles by size measure (120-a)^{circ} and (120+a)^{circ}, where a is a natural number. Then the difference in size between these two angles is (2 a)^{circ}, which is the common difference of the arithmetic sequence. This means that the largest angle measures (120+a+2 a+2 a)^{circ}=(120+5 a)^{circ}.

The lines AM and CN intersect at point P, and it's given that overrightarrow{AP}=xoverrightarrow{AB}+yoverrightarrow{AC}, where x,y in mathbb{R}.2. Since overrightarrow{CN}=frac{1}{2}overrightarrow{CB}+frac{1}{2}overrightarrow{CA}, we understand that point N is the midpoint of AB. This implies that overrightarrow{AP}=xoverrightarrow{AB}+yoverrightarrow{AC}=2xoverrightarrow{AN}+yoverrightarrow{AC}.3. Given that points C, P, and N are collinear, we deduce that 2x+y=1.4. Also, since points A, P, and M are collinear, overrightarrow{AP} is parallel to overrightarrow{AM}. This means there exists a real number k such that overrightarrow{AP}=koverrightarrow{AM}, leading to xoverrightarrow{AB}+yoverrightarrow{AC}=kleft(frac{3}{4}overrightarrow{AB}+frac{1}{4}overrightarrow{AC}right)=frac{3k}{4}overrightarrow{AB}+frac{k}{4}overrightarrow{AC}.5. From the above, we can set up the equations x=frac{3k}{4} and y=frac{k}{4}, which implies that x=3y.6. Combining the equations 2x+y=1 and x=3y, we solve for x and y:   - Substituting x=3y into 2x+y=1, we get 2(3y)+y=1 Rightarrow 6y+y=1 Rightarrow 7y=1 Rightarrow y=frac{1}{7}.   - Substituting y=frac{1}{7} into x=3y, we get x=3left(frac{1}{7}right) = frac{3}{7}.7.

Therefore, we have:frac {1}{a_n} - 2 = left(frac {1}{3}right)^n.From this, the general term formula for {a_n} can be deduced as:a_n = boxed{frac {3^n}{2 times 3^n + 1}}, text{ for } n in mathbb{N}^*.(2) Consider frac {n}{a_n}, which can be rewritten as n cdot left(frac {1}{3}right)^n + 2n.

We assume the equation of line AB is x=my+n. By substituting y^2=4x into the equation of line AB, we get y^2-4my-4n=0. The discriminant of this quadratic equation in y is Delta = (-4m)^2 - 4(-4n) = 16(m^2+n) > 0, ensuring two distinct real roots, which correspond to points A and B on the parabola. Using Vieta's formulas, y_1+y_2=4m and y_1y_2=-4n. The slopes of lines OA and OB are {k}_{OA}=frac{y_1}{x_1} and {k}_{OB}=frac{y_2}{x_2}, respectively. Given that y^2=4x, we can express x_1 and x_2 in terms of y_1 and y_2 as x_1=frac{y_1^2}{4} and x_2=frac{y_2^2}{4}. Thus, the product of the slopes is k_{OA}cdot k_{OB}=frac{y_1}{frac{y_1^2}{4}}cdotfrac{y_2}{frac{y_2^2}{4}}=frac{16}{y_1y_2}=-4. Solving this equation gives n=1, leading to the equation x=my+1. The length of AB can be calculated as |AB|=sqrt{1+m^2}|y_1-y_2|=sqrt{1+m^2}sqrt{(4m)^2+16}=4sqrt{1+m^2}geqslant 4. Therefore, statement ① is correct.For ②, we consider specific points on the parabola C: y^2=4x such as A(1,-2) and B(1,2), which satisfy the condition for the product of the slopes of lines OA and OB being -4. The distances from O to A and B are both sqrt{5}, so |OA|+|OB|=2sqrt{5}<8, proving that statement ② is incorrect.For ③, the focus of the parabola C: y^2=4x is F(1,0). From the analysis in ①, we found that the equation of line AB is x=my+1, which passes through (1,0), the focus of the parabola. Hence, statement ③ is correct.For ④, we already determined that |AB|=4sqrt{1+m^2}. The distance d from point O to line AB is given by d=frac{|-1|}{sqrt{1+m^2}}=frac{1}{sqrt{1+m^2}}. The area of triangle OAB is {S}_{triangle OAB}=frac{1}{2}cdot|AB|cdot d = 2sqrt{1+m^2}geq 2, indicating that the minimum value of the area of triangle OAB is 2, which confirms that statement ④ is correct.Therefore, the correct answer is boxed{A}."},{"problem":"1.

Therefore, there must be an error in the initial assumption. Looking back at the formation of our equations, we realize that the second equation that arose from the term without x—specifically, a + b = -2—is indeed correct, but we overlooked the constant term during the subtraction step. Let us reevaluate this:begin{align*}(2a+b)x + a + b &= 8x - 2, text{Compare the constant terms:} quad a + b + 7 - 7 &= -2, a + b &= -2.end{align*}Therefore, equation (1) stays 2a + b = 8 and equation (2) is indeed a + b = -2.From (1), substituting a = 4 into (2) we find:begin{align*}4 + b &= -2, b &= -2 - 4, b &= -6.end{align*}Thus, the correct values are a = 4 and b = -6.[boxed{a = 4, quad b = -6}]"},{"problem":"Koschei the Deathless thinks of three two-digit numbers: a, b, c.
