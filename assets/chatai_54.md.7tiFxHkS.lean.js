Please check your blood pressure and also kidney functions. Since there is no mention of your weight and height, being overweight can also lead to such a problem. If BP is high, get it properly controlled. Also, get the blood supply to your lower limbs as in diabetes blood vessels of lower limb are affected. A color Doppler study will help.Hope I have answered your query.

But, if it is for quite a long time, you should at least do one USG abdomen followed by an endoscopy if required later. Sometimes, few antidiabetic drugs also cause a feeling of fullness and bloating in abdomen but you have not mentioned which medicines are you on. Also, sometimes other coexistent disorders like thyroid will cause wearing off sleep and also bowel disturbances. So, please get a thyroid profile also done.

He has recently been diagnosed with type 1 diabetes, about 5 months ago. Lately, he has been having slight chest pain, no energy at all, and dizzy spells very often. His current doctor said it is because his body is still adjusting to the insulin....but does it really take the body this long to adjust to insulin? I don t think he should be having chest pain and dizzy spells. He says he feels weird . His current doctor is booked until July. We are thinking of going to emergency room, but I would like an answer from here first. His doctor also said he is in the honeymoon stage of diabetes. I believe he has not been monitored by his doctor closely enough.","Doctor":"Hello and Welcome to ‘Ask A Doctor’ service.I have reviewed your query and here is my advice.Following are my observations and suggestions: 1) Chest pain is unlikely to be there due to the body getting adjusted to insulin because the effect of insulin is to reduce excess blood glucose and normalize the levels. 2) Chest pain could be because of overall weakness and fatigue which does happen in uncontrolled diabetes. 3) Honeymoon phase is a condition that occurs in T1 DM when insulin injections are given, the remaining pancreatic beta cells (which are insulin producing) get rest as there is no load on them. This improves their function and they start producing more amount of insulin. Thus the requirement of exogenous insulin reduces. Plus patient shows a better blood glucose control. This phase may last for a few weeks to months or longer. But invariably for few weeks. 4) If the patient is feeling tired and exhausted, that means his blood glucose is not well controlled. If glucose levels are well controlled then general health of the patient rapidly improves. It is necessary to monitor insulin dosage, dietary intake, and blood glucose levels more closely and meticulously then only all the symptoms will be well controlled.Hope I have answered your query.

Now a days mostly diagnosis is done on HbA1c%. If HbA1c% is>6.5%, diabetes is confirmed. Metformin is the firstchoise drug in T2 DM. Plus that drug does not cause drowsiness. Since this patient  had already a svere Staph infection, it is possible that the same has not  been cured completely. That is the reason for getting chills and fever. So please ensure that his infection is cured completely with appropriate antibiotics and also blood glucose level is also controlled properly.

I have several high stress jobs including practicing law, professional music, and personnel management for a symphony. I am recently having moderate sharp stabbing pain that lasts less than one second in my right temple. These recur. I have timed them and the frequency ranges from 4 to 25 second intervals. This has been going on for about a week. Ibuprofen helps sometimes, but not always. the only trigger I have noticed is that sometimes when I turn my head quickly to the right, as in driving, this triggers it, but not always.  They become less noticeable when I am fully engaged, for example in a music performance or a court hearing.I am also experiencing unusual fatigue.  Sometimes routine tasks are very hard to do.  I have also experienced loss of balance generally over the last few years. Also loss of strength. For example until a few years ago I routinely did 40-60 pushups per day, now I struggle to do 2 or 3.  Lately I feel as if I am sometimes confused and disoriented. My cognitive functions feel impaired.  Routine tasks like driving, and playing my instrument are normal.","Doctor":"Hello, Thanks for the query.I have gone through the details given and I do understand yur concern. I have following few suggestions: 1) You will have to give a re-look at your diabetes treatment. Because if blood glucose is not well controlled then excess loss of glucose through urine (glycosuria) does lead to loss of energy and tiredness and constant fatigue. 2) Present treatment looks to be inadequate, some additional drugs need to be added. (since no blood levels or HbA1c% is mentioned, it is difficult to be specific). 3) Weight reduction is also very important as excess weight (fat)  is the main cause for Insulin resistance. EVen a 5% reduction in present weight can help in improving blood glucose control. 3) Take a diet that helps better blood glucose control, avoid junk foods, high fat food products, increase intake of green leafy vegetables and salads, yogurt and low fat cheese. 4) Increase your time spent on exercise to abut 1 hour or more per day 5) Get a thyroid function test done, to rule out if there is hypothyroidism . 6) Lastly learn some relaxing techniques like Silva Mind Control Methods an alpha level relaxation which wiil definitely help in managing stress. Even ED which is a major long term complication of uncontrolled diabetes can be helped  with better blood glucose control. Plus some medications also may be needed.I hope I have addressed some of your concerns.

In such a situation excess glucose lost through urine causes loss of energy and tiredness and feeling low in energy. Since you have not mentioned any relevant details it is difficult comment very specifically.

Like Diabetics ? prostate problem, etc","Doctor":"Welcome to HCM,Perhaps I can give you some insight into the few labs you have given, but we don't look at labs without specificity and the entire lipid panel, not just one value and be able to give you an accurate impression of what they mean.In general, a fasting laboratory glucose test 125 mg/dl and above verified in the same manner twice is indicative of a diagnosis of diabetes. 5.7-6.4 A1C is prediabetic, but you have not mentioned whether these values are fasting or post-prandial.  A fasting triglyceride level is an independent risk for heart disease and standards recommend keeping it below 150 mg/dl.  A level of 219 indicates a need for a low fat, high fiber, low fructose/high fructose corn syrup diet. So, I hear you are worried about your health. I do see some risk factors you can lower. A good public health diet is the Mediterranean Diet with no added sugar, no alcohol, and cut the fructose out, eat whole food and avoid added sugar. You would benefit from an exercise program to stimulate cardiac circulation. I would suggest both cardio and strength training routines.If you need to lose weight, losing it will be most helpful for lowering triglycerides, sugar and increasing overall health. Keep in touch periodically with your personal doctor to have your labs monitored and explained.You gave me a UA without a creatinine. However, I would keep my eye on the kidneys if you were my patient.  A UA of 30 protein could be significant, would like to check with creatinine ratio. Possibility of decreased kidney function. What is your glomerular filtration rate (GFR)? If you are in early stages of kidney decline keeping your protein lean and low might preserve the functioning you have. In summary, if you were my patient I would counsel you on a low fat, high fiber, high water, lean low protein diet with no added sugar and limited fructose. Read labels, no high fructose corn syrup. I would also advise a full physical and referral to a Dietitian with complete labs, diagnosis and diet order for an individualized lifestyle plan.

And also avoid such abrupt stopping of antidiabetic medications in the future. Diabetes is a chronic condition that requires long term medication. You need to take the medications as prescribed. Getting off on an antidiabetic drug is extremely rare. The dose and medications depends upon your blood glucose control. For now, I suggest you against using your husband's insulin. You need to get yourself evaluated by an endocrinologist or a physician. As you are insulin naive, it's difficult to predict the effectiveness of insulin dose. And the metformin in your system can exaggerate insulin action. Please do follow the prescription as suggested by your doctor. Medications will be based on blood glucose levels and glycemic control. You will also be advised to get HbA1C values that predicts your average glycemic control over few weeks as you are not compliant with medications. I hope the above information helps you.

It is called life style changes. Weight loss achieved through diet and exercise can prevent pre-diabetics from becoming diabetics.As to Fenofibrate it is a medication for high lipids/cholesterol, which frequently is a condition present in patients who also have elevated sugar and are obese, and should be treated early to decrease the risk of cardiovascular diseases  like having heart attack or a stroke.Your doctor likely has checked your blood tests - for diabetes he would check blood sugar level and so called hemoglobin A1C (HbA1C)  and for lipids/cholesterol he would have done a so called Lipid panel which includes total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol HDL cholesterol and triglycerides.Next time you see your doctor  ask him/her if he could show you/discuss these results. HbA1c of 6.5 or higher done on two occasions makes a diagnosis of Diabetes mellitus.HbA1c of 5.7 to 6.4 makes a diagnosis of pre-diabetes.Hope I answered your question.If you need additional information, I will be glad to clarify further.Regards and best of health."},{"Patient":"Hello my name is Gretchen I'm 40 years old I am a diabetic but in the last year or two I have lost all energy don't want to get out bed every muscle in my body hurts I'm in bed 19 to 24 hours because of pain and energy I know there is something going on cause I know my body I have tried to lose weight but it's impossible I also have chronic back pain what could it be","Doctor":"Hello, Thanks for the query.I have seen the details given. Following are a few suggestions since there  are no details given about blood glucose control, drugs being taken, duration of diabetes, if there are any other complications like neuropathy and retinal problem present or not, no info on lipids, actual body weight & height and dietary pattern. 1) Please see that your blood glucose is very well controlled with fasting glucose 3) Avoid sweets, junk foods, pastries, colas, bakery items, too much of cheese, 4) Refrain from alcohol and smoking, 5)Increase the intake of green leafy vegetables and salads and permitted fruits. 6) You may have to look at your current treatment and if needed change it completely. 7) Also get a thyroid assay done to see if there is any problem with that gland too.Because just having diabetes even if it is a bit uncontrolled will not sap your energy totally. It is absolutely essential for you to take proper medical guidance from a good diabetologist in your locality. Because at 40 years you are too young to have these kind of problems. Please force your self to do some physical exercise daily. Begin with 10 to 15 minutes and then increase the duration and intensity. I hope  these suggestions do help. Thanks."},{"Patient":"I have sore muscles in my lower legs and feeling very tired. I do have type 2 diabetes but my blood sugars are not high or out of control. The feeling of fatigue is being to be overwhelming and the pain in my legs keep me from sleeping or getting rem sleep","Doctor":"Hello,I read your query and I would like to say that Diabetes can cause weakness and loss of fitness. Having raised blood sugar levels sometimes after a heavy meal and occasional altered salt levels puts muscles at a disadvantage and they don't perform quite well. Also with time as diabetes progresses, the blood supply to small nerves is lost and that nerve fiber dies.When the nerve serving a muscle fibre dies then the muscle fibre will also stop working. In addition people with diabetes also have an increased tendency to narrowing of the arteries that is a condition called peripheral vascular disease which is caused by narrowing of the arteries, usually due to the build-up of cholesterol. It is associated with smoking and poor diet. The blood supply to the muscles is decreased with time and this phenomenon is more pronounced after exercise, as it can't keep up with the demand. Pain is often more noticeable than weakness but both can be a problem.Hope that solves your query."},{"Patient":"I have low ADH. I have been tested for Diabetes Insipidus and do have it.

Are there any solutions?","Doctor":"Hello, Thanks for the query.The condition diabetes Insipidus is a rare entity. There are two types 1)Neurogenic- where there is deficiency of ADH secretion & 2) Nephrogenic where kidney is resistant to the action of ADH.Since yours is a ADH deficiency disorder, if not very severe then adequate water and other fluid intake should be enough to control the condition. If it is severe, then hormone supplemetation with Desmopresin can be dose. This drug is availabe as tablets, nasal spray and Injections. But better to use it under the guidance of an endocrinologist. It will help reduce water loss and improve all the associated symptoms. Thanks."},{"Patient":"I am 45. Female. 6 1.5 . 155 lbs. Been checking my blood sugar because it ran high at a health screening.

Your blood glucose levels are high, both fasting (247 mg) & after food (463 mg). This definitely is a serious concern. You have diabetes, which needs immediate initiation of treatment. Because of high glucose level after dinner, you are bound get more urine at night, disturbing your sleep. Feeling excessively thirsty, more hungry and going to toilet more often are clear signs of diabetes, plus tired feeling. Ideally there has to be immediate treatment initiation to control blood glucose, plus diet control like avoiding sweets, deep fried foods, high fat products (cheese), junk foods, pastries and other bakery items. Your weight and height seem to be fine. Plus avoid sweet corn syrup containing products and colas. If possible please seek immediate advise from the doctor. Waiting is not good.

That side effect is almost always seen with pragabalin. Reduced dosage, might help in lessening the sleepiness. It is one of the most commonly used drugs to control pain in diabetic neuropathy. You should informm your MD and find out if an alternative can be given or reduced dosage may be used. It is also very important to achieve  strict blood glucose control with fasting glucose around <100 mg, PP 150 to 160 mg & HbA1c% 6.8.

Some times  it can affect a single nerve (acute mononeuropathy), as your present complaint is there. Most important is to achieve a strict blood glucose control with fasting <100 mg, PP 160 to 180 mg & HbA1c%<7. This will help in reducing the intensity of neuropathy.

I was taking the pill format and my A1c was in the range for 6-8, after I was prescribed just the metformin and long lasting insulin my A1c has been in the 14+.","Doctor":"Hello, Thanks for the query.Gabapentine is a good drug for reducing neuropathy related pain.Other drug is Pragabalin in doses of 75 to 100 mg once or twice a day.But most importantly having a strict blood glucose control is absolutely essential. With a HbA1c% of 14 plus your diabetes is totally uncontrolled. In that situation just taking either Gabapentine or any other drug is not going to help much.  You need to bring fasting glucose <100 mg, PP 1150 to 160 mg & HbA1c%<7. Because presence of high glucose in peripheral blood will make nerve fibers more irritated. So please see that your blood glucose is rapidly brought to levels mentioned above. Then only there will be any benefit from drugs to reduce pain.

I can t reach her or my endocrinologist. I should stop taking it - right?","Doctor":"Hello, Thanks for the query.I have gone through the details.   As you have mentioned, due to Methylprednisolone 4 mg, blood glucose level is definitely going up. (390 mg).  There is no mention whether before taking this drug, blood glucose levels were normal or not. Because 390 mg is too high. Since you are Insulin (two types), earlier levels must have been well controlled. Corticosteroids are known to increase blood glucose levels as they have a strong diabetogenic action. Your physician must have been aware of it. He should have advised you on how to control glucose during this treatment,as it appears you are in the need of that drug. Once that treatment is over or the drug is discontinued, glucose levels will revert. But you are not suppposed to abruptly stop a steroid. There has to be a slow tapering of the dose. So even if you want to discontinue do the same in consultation with the pulmonologist. Increasing insulin dose and adjusting diet also can help in cotrol of rising glucose level.

Should I take medication or can it be controlled by diet/lifestyle changes ? Thank you for your kind attention - A. Sen Gupta, Bangalore, India.","Doctor":"Hello Sir,Thank you for your query. I understand your concerns .Based on the reports, you do have diabetes. For good glucose control your HBA1C should be less than 6.5%, your fasting blood glucose should be less than 110 mg/do and your 2 post meal glucose should be less than 160-170 mg /dl ( provided you are fit and fine and do not have any other debilitating illnesses). I am not sure of your age.As your sugar levels are borderline you could try 3 month trial of diet and exercise alone to control your glucose levels. After 3 months measure the blood tests again. If they have reduced then you can continue the same healthy lifestyle changes and keep checking your blood glucose levels every 3 months. If your blood glucose levels have not changed or have worsened after the 3 month trial of diet and exercise then you need to start medication along with your lifestyle changes.Healthy lifestyle tips:1) Exercise-moderate exercise like brisk walking, cycling, swimming etc - for atleast 45-60 min every day or atleast 5 out of 7 days in a week.2) Diet: Avoid sugary food items and sweets , cookies, chocolates etc. take plenty of vegetables ( restrict potatoes). Take whole grains products  like wheat bread, oats, millets, brown rice etc. Avoid refined /plain flour items. you can take 2-3 servings of fruit( avoid mango, jack fruit, custard apple, chikko ). Take adequate protein ( eggs, pulses, non veg- but restrict mutton). Can take 5-7 nuts like almonds, cashew nuts etc. Restrict saturated fats like butter, cheese, paneer etc. 3) Reduce weight if you are overweight.I wish you well.I hope this answer has been helpful to you.Regards Dr Sunita Sayammagaru"},{"Patient":"I had a my blood tested at my physician's office the other day along with an urinalysis and an EKG. Everything was good including my blood pressure, oxygen absorption and pulse, body mass...etc. but my blood sugar level is 149. They said not to be alarmed. To cut back on all sugars and carbs. Is that sufficient or should I pursue a more vigorous anti-diabetic regimen?","Doctor":"Hello,Thank you for your query. I understand your concerns.Random blood glucose value of 149 indicates that your blood sugar is in the Pre-diabetic range. You do not yet have diabetes, and if you control your blood glucose levels by appropriate diet and exercise, the chances of developing diabetes are reduced. For a person to be in non-diabetic range, their fasting blood glucose levels should be less than 106, their 2 hour post prandial blood glucose/random blood glucose should be less than 140.Your doctor has been correct in telling you to cut down on sugars and carbohydrates. Carbohydrates are needed for the human body to function – without carbohydrates we can’t get strength to our daily tasks. But the important thing to remember here is we need to consume only that many carbohydrates as needed by the body and not more. We also need to exercise so that our energy input=energy output.I do not think that at this time you need more vigorous anti-diabetic regimen.My advice would be:1)     Restrict all sugar food items – cakes, chocolates, cookies etc.2)     Avoid/restrict food items made from plain flour.3)     Use whole grain products – for e.g. use brown bread, consume unpolished rice/brown rice, millets, wheat, oats, quinoa etc.4)     Eat plenty of vegetables – but restrict potatoes a they have mainly carbohydrates5)     You can eat fruits as they have anti-oxidants and vitamins – avoid mango, chikoo, custard apple, jackfruit 6)     Honey, Molasses, Unrefined sugar are all equally bad7)     Restrict high fatty food – cut down on saturated fats like butter, cheese etc.8)     You need to include protein in your diet every day, this is present in pulses/lentils, eggs, non-vegetarian (restrict mutton-chicken and fish are good)9)     You can take nuts: 5-7 cashew nuts, almonds, walnuts etc.10)     Exercise at least 45 min-60 min for at least 5 days of a week. It should be moderate exercise – jogging, cycling, brisk walking etc.11)     If you are obese/over weight-you have to reduce weight, by following the above diet and exercise you can lose weight. Target weight loss should be 1.5-2 kg/month.Measure your blood glucose levels in 2-3 months. It should have reduced. Keep checking your blood glucose levels every 6 months. You can also check your HbA1C(which is your average blood glcuose over the past 3 months - non-diabetic value is less than 5.6%).I wish you good health.I hope this answer has been helpful to you.RegardsDr Sunita Sayammagaru"},{"Patient":"Good morning!I am Johnpaul Pereira, 36yrs, 104kgs, i have done my blood test last week it has detected elevated sugar levels 130 mg/dl fasting and 132mg/dl PP.6months back it was 121mg/dl.

My heart specialist suggested I try Humulin but says I should get with my personal Physician and see which Humulin I should start with? Any suggestions?Steve","Doctor":"Hello,Thank you for your query. I understand your concerns.Your heart specialist is correct regarding Avandia and Actos causing heart problems (usually heart failure) and kidney problems. You could benefit with insulin as it is safe in both heart and kidney disorder patients.Humulin is insulin. I will try and explain to you in brief. There are 3 types of Humulin.1)     Humulin S/Humulin R: This is short acting (S) or Regular (R) insulin. This needs to be taken 30 minutes before meals. Its action starts about 30-60 minutes after injecting, and it has its peak action at about 3 hours after injecting and the action lasts for about 6-8 hours. It is usually given twice a day. This insulin helps to reduce the blood glucose spike which is seen after a meal; hence this is given before the meals.2)     Humulin I: This is Isophane/intermediate acting (I) insulin. It is given once a day usually. Its action starts after 2-4 hours after injecting, its peak action is around 5-10 hours after injection, and the action lasts for about 16-18 hours. This insulin helps to reduce the background blood glucose levels (there is a constant supply of glucose in the blood throughout the 24 hours and this is synthesised from the liver and muscles by a variety of chemical messengers like glucagon, cortisol, adrenaline etc.)3)     Humulin M3, M5: These are pre-mixed insulins and these insulins have both the short acting and the isophane insulins mentioned above in varying ratios (30/70; 50/50). This is to be injected 30 minutes before meals and has the advantage of taking two insulins with one shot. Disadvantage is that it is slightly tricky to titrate your dose if your sugar is fluctuating. I am not sure how your blood glucose level is. If it is very high you could benefit with morning and evening doses of Humulin S along with bed time dose of Humulin I. Once your sugars are under control you could switch over to Humulin M3 twice daily. I would advise you to see your doctor, so that you could discuss with him in detail about the various insulins.I hope this answer has been helpful to you.RegardsDr Sunita Sayammagaru"},{"Patient":"I have face constipation problem and gastric problem a lot.

I have gone through the details given. As it is clear that you are on multiple drugs for a number of medical conditions including T2 DM, hypothyroidism and depression. There are 7 drugs listed, which you are taking regularly.  Of these drugs Metformin 1000 mg twice a day, is most often very well tolerated drug. Common side effects noticed on beginning of treatment with it are mostly gastrointestinal disturbances. Which invariably stop on taking the drug with or after food. Tremors (shivering) is unlikely to happen with that drug. Among other drugs duloxetine is more likely to cause symptoms like restlessness, poor coordination and shivering. Even Injections Humira (adalimumab) is the other drug which causes weakness & dizziness.  SOmetimes due to multiple medications it is very difficult to pin point which particular side effect is due to which specific drug. But Metformin is unlikely drug for shivering.  As regards feeling of weakness, if both diabetes (blood glucose) uncontrolled as well as if hypothyroidism is also not well controlled, there can be fairly severe weakness as well as sleepy feeling. Since there is no mention of blood glucose levels and HbA1c% as well as TSH levels, it is difficult to know.Thanks"},{"Patient":"My aunt had her big toe amputated in October due to an abscess from diabetes.

E coli is normally present in the gut and does not cause any harm. But some strains of E Coli can cause intestinal and urinary tract infection.Uncommonly  E. coli can cause skin infections especially in diabetic patients. They can cause cellulitis and foot ulcers. When patient has diabetes and if it is not properly controlled, their immune system becomes weakened. These people are more susceptible for uncommon infections and also the infections take a long time to settle down.E. coli could have colonised the foot ulcer from the her own gut, from person to person contact ( hand to mouth contact ), from contact with animals  etc.Hopefully her infection will subside as her doctors have found the causative organism.I wish her a speedy recovery.Regards Dr Sunita Sayammagaru"},{"Patient":"My pal who has been diagnosed w/ diabetes & the 40 something yr old fellow also is a regular (sometimes daily) user (a shooter) of methamphedamine .

The morning blood glucose is still at the borderline, but your evening blood glucose is quite normal.If you could start exercising, you blood glucose values would come even lower than this. Is there any reason that you are not exercising like arthritis of knees etc? If you want you could increase your night dose of Metformin to 1000 mg and continue with your morning dose of Metformin 800 mg and recheck your blood tests in a couple of weeks. If your morning blood glucose test reading is too low (like 60-70 mg/dl), you could go back to the 800 mg at night time.If you are going to start exercising, then you can continue the same dose of Metformin 800 mg twice a day, as exercise increases insulin sensitivity.I hope this answer has been helpful to you.RegardsDr Sunita Sayammagaru"},{"Patient":"for my mother, her sugar level is fasting 135 and postal prandial is 238 tested @8 march 2017 .she taking glycomet gp 0.5/500.vogo 0.2g.ovlance/olmin20g ,crevan f 5/67.before test.now doctor refer to take glycimark.m 40/500,vogo0.2olmetec 20g, remyelin.d.but we again take postal prandial sugar test today her sugar level is 195 and pressure is 100.4","Doctor":"Hello,Thank you for your query.

Assuming your mother is less than 60 years old and that she is reasonably good health, if she is taking Glycimark M 40/500 only once a day then it can be increased to twice a day ( 15 -30 min before breakfast and before dinner). If she is already taking this tablet twice a day, then she can increase the dose of this, she can take Glycimark M 80/500 twice a day. Recheck her blood glucose levels in 2 weeks .If her blood glucose is still high then she can take Vogo 0.2 mg either twice a day ( if previously she has been taking it only once ) or up to three times a day ( if she has been taking it only twice a day).If at any point she experienced low blood glucose symptoms like sweating, hunger, dizziness, fast heart beat, mood changes etc, then it is the Glycimark-m that is causing the symptoms and she needs to reduce the dose of this. The immediate treatment of low blood glucose is by taking a tablespoon of honey/sugar, sugar candies, glass of fruit juice or regular Pepsi/coke etc . This should be followed by a carbohydrate snack like sandwich, milk with 2 biscuits, fruit etc within the next 1 hour.her blood pressure is fine and she needs to continue with her Olvance and Crevan-F.I hope this answer has helped you.Regards Dr Sunita Sayammagaru"},{"Patient":"I was just getting my nails done at a nail salon and I passed out I'm not sure if it was from the fumes I had my father check my blood sugar an hour later it was 142 should I be checked for diabetes    Was having a work party all I had to eat was to rice crispy treats and a piece of bacon   Plus I have a bad head cold","Doctor":"Hello.Thanks for the query.On the basis of the reports you have told me, diabetes is unlikely.The sugars should have been either much lower, or very much higher.Still, it is always a good idea to test for diabetes.Testing with FBS PPBS HbA1C may help.Getting a cardiac and neurological check up to rule out arrhythmia, TIA and seizures is more essential, if the sugar tests are normal.Let us know the reports for further details.Dr Saumya Mittal"},{"Patient":"Hi I am a female aged 55.... diagnosed with diabetes since June 2015....

I do Yoga for an hour 4 times a week and walk for 30 mins 6 days a week.... my blood sugar levels are always over 200 fasting and similar after meals..... kindly advise","Doctor":"Hello Madam,Welcome to Healthcare Magic.I have read your question fully and understand your concerns.You are taking the right medications – Carbophage XR, Diamicron and Volix are all the medication that I would prescribe in a diabetic patient. But your blood glucose levels are still high. For blood glucose to be in normal range your fasting blood glucose should be less than 110 and your 2 hour post prandial should be less than 160. Your HbA1C which is your 3 month average blood glucose value should be around 6.5%. (If you have not yet got your HbA1C done, kindly get it done soon)You could increase your Carbophage dose. The molecule in it is Metformin. So, if your kidneys are functioning normally (you may have had serum creatinine levels, serum urea levels and eGFR test done by your diabetes specialist before), you could increase your Metformin to 1000 mg twice a day. You could take Carbophage XR 1000 MG twice daily.You could also increase your Volix 0.3 mg to three times a day instead of 2 times a day.You can continue your Diamicron XR 60 mg, or you could stop it completely and take Amaryl 1-2 mg once or twice a day depending on your FBG, PPG and HbA1C levels.I think you may need another tablet in –addition to the above. You could ask your doctor if he could prescribe either Vildagliptin 50 mg-100 mg or Dapagliflozin 10 mg to your existing medication above. This decision again should be based on your blood glucose levels and HbA1C levels. I would advise you to see your doctor first, so that he could check if you have any contraindications to not to take any of the medicines mentioned.I hope this answer has helped you.Thank youRegardsDr Sunita Sayammagaru"},{"Patient":"my husband has had a swollen knee and leg for a week. no injury and no brakes.

I can no longer bend my toes and walking is hell. I my foot looks like its dying. Im scared and the worse part is i have no heath care. ANY SUGGESTIONS?","Doctor":"Hello,Welcome to Healthcare Magic.I have read your question fully and understand your concerns.From what you are mentioned, with your foot swollen and in pain, I suspect it could be either cellulitis or Charcot’s foot. Cellulitis is an infection of the skin of your feet. There is swelling, pain, redness and increased warmth. Treatment is by antibiotics for about 10-14 days. Charcot’s foot is a complication of uncontrolled diabetes. Diabetes if not properly controlled can cause damage to nerves-called peripheral neuropathy. The patient may lose sensation in the feet. So, he cannot feel trauma or irritation, thus a small wound may become a festering infection. Diabetes also causes poor circulation of blood. Due to poor circulation the bones and joint weaken and result in fractures or dislocations. As patient cannot feel the pain of fractures, he continues to walk and this worsens the condition. Ultimately the foot gets swollen and deformed.  Prompt offloading of your foot is very important, if not the deformity would be permanentHence, I would advise you to see your doctor as soon as possible. I am sorry, I do not understand much about health insurance in USA, but your health is important too. Hence, kindly see a doctor.I hope this answer has helped you.

It can be brought on sometimes by pregabalin or cervical disc compression. Pregabalin can also cause drowsiness.The falling could be due to imbalance which is brought on by peripheral neuropathy in diabetes.You need to get a complete ophthalmic check up since blurring of vision could occur with diabetic retinopathy.

But I have cut out the microbrews and mostly drink just lager beer now. I have had bad cholesterol numbers for years. I am taking metformin (1000 mg) twice a day. I am also taking Lisinopril and Atorvastatin. My diabetes is due mostly to my weight (5 6 and 248 lbs) and lack of exercise.

These side effects normally settle down when taken in Slow Release preparation form. So, instead of normal (immediate release) Metformin 1000 mg, you could take Metformin SR 1000 mg.I am not sure since how long you are on Metformin 1000 mg. Normally the side effects settle down in a few weeks. But in a small percentage of patients, the side effects remain. In this scenario, the only option is to reduce your Metformin dose and add in another Anti-Diabetic drug.As you are eating healthy diet now, are you consuming too much fibre? This can also lead to loose stool.So, if your diarrhoea still remains on Metformin SR, kindly see your doctor for further evaluation and advice.

Start with 75 mg once a day and then increase it to 75 mg twice a day. Based on pain relief, you could increase the dose up to a maximum of 300 mg twice a day. As you have tolerated gabapentin well, you should not find much difficulty in tolerating Pregabalin too.Another option is Amitriptyline; you could start at the smallest dose of 10 mg at bed time. Based on pain control, gradually increase to 50 mg at night. If you are still able to tolerate without side effects, you could go up to maximum of 75 mg at night. Side effects from Amitriptyline are dry mouth, sedation, gastric upset, light headedness etc. Many people are able to tolerate lower doses well.Both the tablets are prescription only medications, hence you would need to see a doctor for the prescription.

But if after food blood glucose does go above the kidney threshold (160 to 180 mg), some glucose is filtered in urine, even though there may be no overt diabetes.Secondly, sometimes there is renal glycosuria as kidney threshold may have come down.My suggestion, please get your after food blood glucose and urinary glucose tested, which should help to clarify the doubt. Plus looking at your fasting level, you need to take necessary precautions so as to avoid becoming diabetic.The precautions include regular exercise, weight control and avoiding sweets, junk foods, deep fried foods, aerated sweetened drinks (colas), pastries, and bakery items.Hope I have answered your query.

Thanks Aloke Debnath","Doctor":"HiI am Dr Mittal.I have read your message.I think I can help you.The fact remains that FBS of 120-140, and PPBS of 135-145 is usually considered a fine control.Too tight a control may actually predispose one to hypoglycemia and thereby may cause severe problems.However, if you do want to lower the sugars, you need to alter and watch your diet. And control your weight. Make sure that you are not an any other medicines (like some BP and cholesterol medicines) that can raise the sugars.If all this does not help, the dose of medicine will need to be adjusted further. A small dose of metformin in the afternoon may help you get a better control on the sugars. However, please make sure that the dose should not be changed on the basis of just one set of readings.

You are right, both medicines contain Metformin as one of the ingredient, but Glycomet GP1 has 1 mg of Glimiperide and the other (Ozomet G2) has 2 mg of glimileride. The reduction in blood glucose level noticed is due to the higher dose of Glimiperide. This drug stimulates Beta cells in pancreas to synthesise Insulin. Higher dose means there a greater stimulation.Still the blood glucose levels  (Fasting 130 mg & PP 240 mg) are much higher than ideal levels in case of good control like Fasting closer to 100mg, PP 150 to 160 mg and HbA1c% Therefore, it is necessary to improve the current treatment so that desired blood glucose  levels are achieved consistently.I am sure you are aware it is essential to achieve a very strict blood glucose control in order to postpone or prevent long term complications of diabetes affecting various vital organ in the body. In addition to specific drugs, it is very essential to take a restricted diet, that gives exact calories based on ideal body weight, extent of daily exercise  and blood glucose levels. Avoid sweets, deep fried foods, pastries, other bakery items and sweetened aerated drinks (colas) and sweet corn syrup containing food products. Consume more of green leafy vegetables and salads.  Also exercise daily for at least 1 hour, brisk walking is a good option.

Affection to small blood vessels causes problems with retina, kidney and erectile dysfunction. Where as large vessel affection invariably leads to improper blood supply to lower limbs. This along with peripheral neuropathy can make limbs feel cold, numb and there may be altered sensation. Plus due lack of blood supply and hyperglycemia wounds do not heal quickly, leading to serious consequences.To overcome this maintaining a strict blood glucose control with fasting closer to 100 mg, PP 160 to 180 mg & HbA1c%<7, is necessary. Plus if the problem is severe, causing intermittent claudication (severe cramps on walking), then a colour Doppler test or angieography  may have be  done. But most important is strict blood glucose control.

But if once diabetes sets in (Fastin: 126 mg and above, PP 200 mg and above & HbA1c%6.5 and above), then treatment with specific drugs is absolutely necessary. Selection of medication will depend upon the severity of blood glucose levels. Along with drugs he will have to observe a strict diet control as well as exercise daily for at least 1 hour. Plus maintain a near normal weight. Since no details are available like fasting, PP levels, HbA1c%, weight, height and extent of daily exercise and dietary pattern, it is difficult advise a specific drug therapy.

Further, if blood glucose is not rapidly controlled, then glucotoxicity due to hyperglycemia (high glucose in blood) further damages beta cells. Therefore, after few years suffering with diabetes almost every single patient has to start taking insulin as most of the cells are non functional. There is no insulin in the system. It has to be given on daily basis for controlling blood glucose, that too for lifetime. Looking at the blood glucose levels mentioned, your mother has to be on Insulin injections along with oral anti-diabetic drugs, if necessary control has to be achieved. There is no other option.If the glucose level is not controlled effectively, the long term serious consequences of diabetes will start manifesting like retinal problems, peripheral neuropathy, affection of blood supply to the lower limbs,  cardiovascular diseases and kidney disease. Ideally if one has to achieve good control then fasting glucose should be closer to 100 mg, PP 160 to 170 mg & HbA1c%Along with Insulin and other drugs, she has to take a restricted diet, avoid sweets completely, also deep fried foods, pastries, bakery items and sweetened aerated drinks (colas).

Is this the start of my kidneys startingto fail, or is it a sign of something else?  The last blood test I had about a month ago-everything came back within range.  Please advise, K","Doctor":"Hi,Flank pain is a relatively common condition that can have a lot of possible etiologies and a number are commonly seen in urology. Anyway I want to say that this is not a sign of diabetic kidney disease because or diabetic nephropathy do not cause pain. So, don't worry. In diabetic nephropathy the filters of the kidneys, the glomeruli, become damaged. Because of this the kidneys 'leak' abnormal amounts of protein from the blood into the urine. This is the main sign that the kidney is starting to fail. Possible causes of your dull right flank pain can be urinary tract infections like Cistitis or pielonefritis or renal calculi.I suggest to consult an urologist to investigate about your flank pain (urine test, blood test, ultrasound etc) and if you find the cause ,you can have the right treatment.Hope I have clarified your doubts.

The surgery is the standard treatment for inflammation and infection of the appendix and patients usually recover from appendectomy without experiencing complications. A ruptured appendix is considered a medical emergency. Surgeons use one of two surgical techniques open appendectomy or laparoscopic appendectomy for removal of appendix. The choice of method is made by the surgeon on a case-by-case basis. Paralytic ileus and wound infection may occur following the operation."},{"Patient":"my husband is diabetic...I am concerned apparently more than he is.

A 2 hour post postprandial should not be higher than 200. Have the doctor set a blood sugar goal with your husband and explain that the diet he is on is forever and have a high blood sugar that \\"he\\" thinks is ok without checking with his physician is also unacceptable reasons to eat cheesecake.

We are looking at possible amputation, blindness, kidney failure, neuropathy, food amputation and heart disease down the road.You ask how is cheesecake. Not allowed. Your husband needs to be instructed on a workable diet for him, have his carbs figured based on blood sugar control, weight goals, likes/dislikes, and on exercise.Try to substitute favorite foods using acceptable foods made to taste like foods he should not have.

Because if blood glucose is high, a lot of it is excreted through urine, making the person weak and even loose weight. Further if you are most often bed ridden, then that can also add to hyperglycemia due to non exercise and to weakness.

Because post the injection, there is a possibility of developing fairly severe hypoglycemia. Best method is avoid extra eating episodes. For insomnia, if it is persistent then there are specific sleep inducing medications which can be taken occasionally. To control blood glucose apart from taking Insulin, strict dietary control and regular exercise of over 1 hour a day is a must.

I hope your dietary habits are also good.Coming to the management of your sugars, your HbA1c is more than what I would like it to be, less than 7 is desirable. Your fasting and postprandial values hence seem to be consistently on the higher side as evidenced by your HbA1c. I would suggest a few options which can be considered at this point of time -1. Improvement in dietary habits - intake of foodstuffs devoid of simple carbohydrates, low in fats and reducing the total calories to about 1200-1500kcal/ day (according to your weight). A dietitian should be consulted for the optimum diet.2. If everything is right with the diet, we may consider increasing the dosage of your medications. As time goes by, the body starts becoming more and more resistant to insulin and hence requirement of medications goes up Inspite of all other measures. You have done well so far with the medication you are on. At this point of time your diabetologist may consider increasing the dosage of your medication to either twice a day or increasing the dose of glimeperide to 2mg. Kindly follow up with your diabetologist for the same.Hope this helps.Regards,Dr Geeta"},{"Patient":"Hi. I am a type 2 diabetic and have been prescribed Janumet.

Based on your query, I gather that you are a hypertensive and have cardiac disease. You are also on medications to lower your cholesterol. Hypertension, heart disease, and high cholesterol levels need to be regularly monitored and medications/dosages adjusted to bring in tight control. Your are currently on medications to reduce blood pressure, cholesterol lowering agents and anti angina medications (for the heart). Your blood pressure seems to be poorly controlled on the current regimen. I recommend you see your physician to change the regimen and see what suits you best.  It will take a couple of months to settle on to a suitable treatment plan and needs to be monitored at regular intervals. Nicardia reduces the blood pressure and is dose dependent. You see a fall in pressure for as long as the effect lasts and then it goes up again. Resistance to medications (when your body doesn't respond,  as expected,  to the medicine when taken for a period of time) also gives rise to poor efficiency. Fluctuations or high blood pressure can lead to stroke, heart failure. If you experience any breathing difficulty, chest pain, giddiness, slurred speech, muscle weakness or numbness, unusual forgetfulness,  please visit the ER right away. Ideally your blood pressure should be between 120-140 (systolic) and 75-85(diastolic), heart rate between 60-70 beats per minute.

It could result from pressure on nerves when your arm is crooked under your head as you fall asleep. Usually painless and soon relieved by removing the pressure that caused it. In many cases, however, numbness in the hands can be severe, episodic, or chronic. It also can accompany other symptoms, such as tingling, pain, itching and muscle wasting. In such cases, numbness may be a sign of nerve damage, which can result from traumatic injuries or repetitive stress injuries, bacterial or viral infections, toxic exposures, and systemic diseases such as diabetes. Such nerve damage is known as neuropathy it affects nerves distant from the brain and spinal cord, often in the hands and feet.Diabetes is one of the most common causes of peripheral neuropathy, accounting for about 30% of cases.If numbness is persistent in your hands it’s important to seek prompt medical evaluation. The earlier the underlying cause of your numbness is identified and brought under control, the less likely you are to suffer potentially lifelong consequences.Hope this information helps...Thanks & Regards,Dr.Shiwani"},{"Patient":"Hi I am 47 years old and was recently diagnosis with type 2 diabetes and recently I noticed I have bad vaginal itching only in the evening.

If there is doubt in diagnosis after clinical evaluation and above test results specialised tests like MRI brain or Spine, Nerve conduction study.

Depending on your insurance these may be paid for.Since you are in the U.S., the first place to start (aside from making an appointment with a dietitian) is the American Diabetic Association. There is so much to learn about when first diagnosed.  The Diabetic Association has a great deal of information on its website.Your diet should be personalized to your likes/dislikes, current intake, medications and timing of meals and healthy food that will help you control your blood sugar.I can offer several options. Since you have a handicap you may be on Medicare and they will reimburse so many educational sessions with the dietitian with a doctor's order. I suggest you try that route first. The next option is to continue to pay up front and come here through the Specialist Portal and I can design a workable meal plan for you. Whichever way you go, these are the things needed to work out a meal plan for you:1. A current diet history of what you eat now and how much2. Your list of medications and supplements3.  Any lab work, diagnosis and/or diet order4. Height,Age, Weight, Weight loss needed?For now, work on the general concepts of eliminating high glycemic foods/simple sugars; limit juice to 1/2 cup per day and emphasize fresh fruit, begin to slowly increase soluble fiber, increase fresh vegetables, cut down on cholesterol to 200 mg/day (diabetics absorb more cholesterol); choose lean cuts of meat. Despite your handicap, try to exercise 150 minutes per week ( arm exercises, whatever you can do safely to get your heart rate up and/or build muscle).Current literature is showing many people with diabetes have an undiagnosed B12 deficiency that may not be indicated by a CBC. It is something I recommend that you check on.You may google eatright.org as a non-member. Then search for Dietitians by zip code and you can find someone in your area. Many Dietitians accept Medicare and that is what you want to look for if that is your insurance provider.This gives you some things to  think about. Kind Regards, Kathryn Shattler, MS,RDN"},{"Patient":"Hi, I have been experiencing vibrations in my chest that now go into my lower torso and legs.

You should also start taking calcium in form of tablets daily and vitD3 60,000 IU once weekly. Kindly mention how much units of insulin you are taking.So far as your chemotherapy is concerned 5 years ago, well it may also cause pain in legs as chemotherapy reduces the potassium in body thereby causing leg cramps. For this I should have asked you to consume banana but since you are a diabetic so I can't ask that. Start having high protein diet in form of soyabeans, you may also consume fenugreek seeds as well.If at all pain worsens then tablet of diclofenac potassium can do your work.But you may consult any endocrinologist for your diabetes and any hematologist to check for your All too.god bless"},{"Patient":"My mother is 89 years old.

In your case all I want to suggest is that kindly get your thyroid profile along with fasting and post prandial blood level done. That will clear the picture that whether your symptoms are related to diabetes or thyroid disorders.Well, your palpitations demands an urgent advice from cardiologist as he might start any medications related to palpitations.

With Productive M, testosterone is production is stimulated which is known from several studies to lower blood sugar significantly.If you were my patient, I would advise you to follow your therapeutic guidelines for blood sugar control 1. Carbohydrate counting (do you know how much you need?; 2. Avoid sugar and high glycemic carbohydrates; 2. Add omega-3 supplements and fatty fish to your diet; 3. Gradually increase your fiber intake focusing on soluble fiber to at least 14 g per 1000 calories; if overweight, lose weight; 4. Exercise more than 150 minutes per week; 5. Avoid all sugar substitutes (stevia may be ok); 6. Use more cinnamon in seasoning; a mediterrean style eating pattern is often recommended.These are just general guidelines for controlling sugar. If you were my patient I would suggest you entertain the thought of diabetic core classes -or at least an individualized visit with a dietitian to get nutritional guidance.Good luck.

I have seen my Dr and she initially did  a xray to see if it was related to constipation.  She had me take Prylosec and murilax for 2 weeks which really did nothing.  Now she would like me to do prylosec for another 6 weeks.  I am wondering what my chances are of this being something more serious such as gastric cancer or colon cancer as these are my greatest fears right now.

Do not have much of an appetite and I am a diabetic so I am experiencing great fluctuation in blood sugar. What could be causing me to have these symptoms? Doctor prescribed Pantotrazole Sodium ER 40mg, 1 tablet per day, for acid reflux.","Doctor":"Welcome! Let's start with making certain the medication is taken properly. Pantotrazole is a proton pump inhibitor and needs to be taken 30-60 minutes before any food is taken. It may decrease absorption of iron, B12, and calcium.Long term use may lead to osteoporosis, so calcium supplementation may be advised.Avoid gingko or St. Johns Wort.It may also increase glucose. So, I reviewed these things because if you violate any of the above it may cause a greater fluctuation than Pantotrazole will cause by itself.Source: 2015 Drug-Nutrient InteractionsIf you are getting sick when eating vegetables and onions avoid all onions. Are the vegetables fresh only or certain vegetables only or anything cooked with onions that make you ill? I am wondering about a developing food intolerance or not using a designated vegetable scrubber to get the increasing levels of food borne bacteria present on our fresh foods. The gold standard for narrowing down this problem is to to keep one of those tedious food diaries to tease out the problem. Date,time,food,symptoms for 7 entire days as sometimes it takes up to 3 days for an infection to kick in. Food intolerances are individual, but have seen them change with time.Avoid all sugar substitutes for right now.When you have additional information, please write me again and we will see if I can suggest some things to stabilize your blood sugars and stop your symptoms.

I am currently taking Enbrel 50mg weekly, methotrexate 2.5 x 6 weekly, Celebrex 200 mg daily, Prilosec 40 mg daily, Neurontin 3 x daily (recently diagnosed with neuropathy),","Doctor":"My dear,Thank you for visiting me here at HCM. You want to know what causes weight gain, decreased eye sight and breathlessness. I have reviewed what little information you sent for such a complex array of problems impacting on your weight gain.I will try to identify as many problems with associated solutions as I can. First of all, youi sent me quite a list of medications, so let us start there. Many of your necessary medications encourage the weight gain process and they are all through different mechanisms. One medication lowers you metabolic rate, so how do we get it back up? Another medication affects one of your appetite hormones, ghrelin. Another acts via leptin. Then lets through in the probable vitamin deficiencies from the medications so your body doesn't have the nutrients it needs to process the food energy it is given. You are correct, it sounds like you are menopausal and it is not uncommon for the hormonal changes to act against your weight control efforts. I would like to go through each medication/condition and how to correct any potential deficiencies or possible interactions: Dry mouth: probably related to RA, do not drink calorie laden drinks like artificial saliva, carry a water bottle. Enbrel: Talk to your doctor about the potential side-effect of optic neuritis that results in some patients taking Enbrel (Decreased Eye Sight Query)It might also cause aplastic anemia, when was your last CBC to check your hemoglobin? (Breathlessness query); Methotrexate: Increase intake of fluids to increase urine output (pay attention that you don't become dehydrated, basically)Interestingly, the side effect is weight loss!Food delays absorption, so take on an empty stomach.; Celebrex- may increase cholesterol, better absorbed on empty stomach but may be irritating requiring adding food with administration; Prilosec - may decrease iron and B12. It looks like your meds may induce anemia. The methotrexate is a folic acid inhibitor and that is its mechanism of action. Neurontin: dry mouth, weight gainOk, so we have some things to work around. It is not all you, so relax and don't blame yourself.I can tell you what I would recommend if you were my patient. Now, green tea is known to increase metabolism which is a problem. If you don't have any clotting issues, I would add uncaffeinated green tea 6 ounces three times a day.Talk to your doctor about some of the vitamin concerns and which type of multivitamin would be safe to take if any (all have folic acid in them); eat small frequent meals with adequate protein and low glycemic index carbohydrates. Swith your oils over to health oils and get rid of trans fat dramatically lower saturated fat and add good fats such as monounsaturated fats, omega-3,etc. Add soluble fiber to help you feel full to counteract the problem with ghrelin. Walk every day. That is about how the health advice I can give without doing a comprehensive assessment to make formal recommendations. I can do that through the specialist portal if you wish.Remember if you want to continue to work this out, send me all medication changes, new labs, sample one day diet, likes/dislikes, diagnosis and any current diet order. Good luck, dear. Kathryn Shattler, MS,RDN"},{"Patient":"I am a 72 year old male. Type 2 diabetic for over 3 years. Take Humalog for 1 1/2 year. Had major heart attack last Oct.

I read carefully your query and I understand your concern.You should eat carbohydrate because they give you fuel, and you should monitor or count the carbohydrates to monitor the insulin intake(that I suppose you take because you have so much time diagnosed with diabetes)because  the  eat more carbohydrate can get your blood glucose high and eat less can get you a low glucose blood level.The carbohydrate are simple like sugar and other is complex like carbohydrate found in beans, nuts, whole grains, vegetables and fruits, you should prefer the complex one because they increase gradually the glucose in blood when they are eaten.The carbohydrate containing foods are: breads, cereals, pasta, rice, grains, starchy (potatoes ,peas etc) and no starchy vegetables(broccoli ,carrots ,greens etc),milk and yogurt, fruits and juice and foods with no carbohydrates are meat ,fish, poultry ,eggs ,cheese ,fats ,oil, butter etc.You should choose whole grain breads, brown rice, raw fruits and vegetable, nuts, low fat/ no fat milk and yogurt, unsweetened beverages.One carbohydrate serving equals to 15 grams of carbohydrates that is contained in one slice bread, 1/3 cup dry pasta or rice, 1/2 cup starchy vegetables etc.For a better determination of your carbohydrates diet you should go to a dietitian to calculate it depending on your insulin intake.Hope I give answer to your problem.

There can be 2 reasons why the morning glucose level is high. One possibility is thatyour night dose is not adequate (we call it dawn effect). The remedy for this is that we increase the night dose of insulin. The other possibility is that your night insulin dose is very high than needed and because of that your sugar levels become vry low in the midnight when you sleep and your body tries to compensate for this low sugar by breaking down complex stored sugars from your liver into blood. (we call this somyogi's phenomenon). For this effect, we need to check the blood sugar at midnight around 2am or so. If this midnight glucose level is very low, then we have to decrease your night insulin levels.

As you said you went to fishing and was exposed high sunlight, it may be one of the possible causeTo briefly tell you, heat stress occurs when the body cannot cool itself enough to maintain a healthy temperature. Heat-related illnesses include heat rash, heat cramps, dizziness or fainting, heat exhaustion, heat stroke, and a worsening of existing medical conditions. Overexertion in hot weather, sun or bushfire exposure, and exercising or working in hot, poorly ventilated or confined areas can increase your risk of heat stressSuggest  -your self with thin clothing next time when you go out to fishing also try to be in the shade or can use portable land umbrellas-Hydrate yourself with fruit juices and plenty of water Also as you said Hypoglycemia may be one of the reason and if you are diabetic then it is a cause of concern otherwise nothing to worryWish You Good HealthRegardsDr Sridhar K"},{"Patient":"I am 28weeks pregnant .i am diagnosed having GDM.i am on insulin A week ago i had a vaginal discharge with a bloody tinge.

Mid meal snacks at 11 am and 5 pm and 10 pm. Try this and I am sure he will feel well. Eat food rich in fiber and that will make you feel full and have a positive effects on glucose levels.

The weakness has gotten so bad that I can barely make it from the parking lot to my office.  My doctor just added Javuna and it doesn't seem to be helping.  Could this weakness be from something else?","Doctor":"Hello. I am Dr. Praveen and I will be answering your question today. Type 2 diabetes especially when its not under control can lead to severe generalised weakness. I would really like to know how your blood glucose levels are and what your last Hba1c was. Do you have any other illnesses like high BP or cholesterol related or kidney disease?  Has anyone told you that you look pale lately? Januvia (sitagliptin) is a very good drug like metformin. Please continue a healthy diet and walk for about 20 min (slow is enough to start with). I could advise better if I knew few more details as mentioned earlier. But as a rule, once the glycemic (sugar) control is better you will begin to feel a lot better.Wishing you good health. Please feel free to drop in any more queries if need be.Take care.

My dad was put on oxycotin/oxycodine and the dosage has continued to rise over the years.  He is now on 80 mg 3x day for several years.  when he runs out he goes through horrible withdrawl and has halluinations and nearly died.  we convinced him this time to go to a nursing home for therapy and reduce the amount of oxy.  he was down to 30 mg. 2x daily.  However, he is double dosing on them, by his own admission.  He was recommended a new doctor, but is going back to his original pain management doctor to get the 180/daily.  My dad has expressed how thats the only thing that relieves pain completely, and the pain in his legs from diabetes, and how it gives him a \\"good feeling\\".  He's also said he cant wait to get to the next one to \\"feel good\\".  He has admitted he would rather shoot his brains out (and he has the guns to do it) than to go without it.   First, what can I do for my dad? and Second, I've told the doctor dad had overdosed before and he still prescribes it after threatening not to.  Is he at fault for continuing my dad's dependency/addiction?","Doctor":"Dear User , Thanks for asking, Sorry to hear about your Dad.After Reading what you have written . I for sure feel your Dad has gotten addicted to Oxycodone. Oxycodone is an Opiod drug and a drug similar to morphine. and is generally used for severe Pain like Pain due to cancer. But its indeed an addictive drug. This Drug shouldnt be stopped Cold turkey, If done can cause severe withdrawl symptoms. Many Physicians prefer tapering the dose like 10 % of the original dose weekly.. and if decided to stop your dad    as an alternative to it ,should  probably be put put on antiepileptics (for neuropathic pain ) and also Antidepressants ... My Sincere Suggestion is Please take him to Detox clinic or deaddiction centre immediatley , Let the doctor there take the call.. Please dont try anything on your own.Wishing your Dad Good health and recovery ..Regards Dr.Samuel"},{"Patient":"I just received a review of my annual blood work and it indicated my hemoglobin range at 15.6h and my hematocrit at 46.4 h an abnormal range for both.

Thank you for taking time to read this and offer some advice....","Doctor":"Hello. I am Dr. Praveen and I will be answering your question today. Its good that you are trying to take charge of the situation. Pre diabetes is actually an oppurtunity for change. Its how well we make use of it.In Type 2 diabetes it is the post meal sugars that go high first and only after a lot of time the fasting goes high. That is why you have high post prandial values.You will experience dizzy shaky episodes if you dont eat for too long because in Type 2 diabetes and pre diabetes your body has a higher than normal insulin as a response to insulin resistance. So what you need to do is to avoid high carb diet and take SMALL AND FREQUENT MEALS.The only proven intervention to preventing diabetes is loosing 10% of your existing body weight and do 30 mt of aerobic exercise like walking, running, swimming for five times a week and resistance training (with weights in a gymn) for two days. Avoid smoking and alcohol.What is your height. Your ideal weight is Ht in cm - 100. Multiple that by 0.9 to get to the ideal weight since you are pre diabetic. Dont worry. Just do one change at a time with regard to your diet and lifestyle and remember its a change for life. Encourage your family to be actively participated because it will help them have a healthy life too. Check your fasting values, Glucose tolerance test and Hba1c annually.Monitor your BP and fasting lipid values twice a year.Wishing you good health.

You are doing the right thing now. What you are experiencing is something called reactive hypoglycemia. It indicates that you are at risk for developing diabetes. What happens is there is a mismatch in the curve of increase in insulin after food to the amount of glucose in your food. As the insulin levels are relatively higher when compared to the actual glucose in the body you are experiencing hypoglcemic symptoms. You need to loose weight take frequent meals and exerciae regularly. Your gtt and FBS will be normal as you are not diabetic yet. Its a problem with the pattern of insulin release. Normally its pulsatile but one at risk for diabetes looses this years earlier causing such symptoms. Don't worry. You will do well with this management. One thing I want to tell you is if you continue to have these symptoms plz be admitted for a prolonged fasting at a hospital and under care when you experience hypoglcemia blood will be taken for insulin levels c peptic cortisol. That will add more clarity. Take care."},{"Patient":"I am 73 y.o. and have AFib, type ll diabetes and have been a non-smoker for a few yrs.

I can work through it if I'm tying my shoes by bending slowly. This has been with me for several years, also. I have had dye injected into my blood stream and had cat scans.

Also check Blood sugar level Fasting and postprandial once in a month or two months.4) If it is feasible for you to do Self monitoring of blood sugar level (BSL done by glucometer at different times of the day (Fasting, 2 hours after breakfast, before lunch, 2 hours after lunch, before dinner, 2 hours after dinner, early morning sugar 3am) all sugar not daily but whole profile in a week at least once in a month.If there are symptoms of low BSL or High BSL you should confirm it.5) Regular BP check, clinical examination to rule out microvascular complications of diabetes (retinopathy -  fundiscopy, foot examination for neuropathy)6) Check your Lipid profile, it is advisable to take statin (lipid lowering drugs) in diabetes patients above 35yrs though normal lipid level.7) It better for you to take metformin in maximal tolerated dose, as it will help in reducing insulin resistance which is a basic pathology of diabetes. Metformin is weight neutral (may help in decreasing weight) and rarely causes hypoglycemia. 8) Depending upon your BSL control and HbA1c level other antidiabetic medicines that are either weight neutral or help in reducing weight can be added.Hypoglycemic blood sugar level in diabetic patient is depend on duration of diabetes, control of diabetes, associated complications.At blood sugar level of 86 you have symptoms of low blood sugar level, so it can be hypoglycemia for you.Also there is rare chances of developing hypoglycemia after taking metformin alone."},{"Patient":"Hi , I am a diabetic patient type 1 from 6yrs ( age 29) its usually in a higher level m trying to control it and I am able to control a little bit.

If indication for PTCA was recent heart attack then insulin is the best option with her blood sugar levels of 300 & 400.2) She is already on 3 different types of Medicine for diabetes and on that her blood sugar levels were 170-220.In that case beside use of insulin alone or in combination with oral medicine, only few options are available which may be costlier and we cannot assure better sugar control with them. 3) Use of different types of oral medicine in her case also depends on her kidney, heart status (which can be known from her serum creatinine level and left ventricular ejection fraction on 2DEcho) Metformin is avoided in case of Deranged serum creatinine and low ejection fraction. Glipizide is avoided with high serum creatinine level. Pioglitazone is avoided in case of signs water retention in body like breathlessness, swelling over legs, significant weight gain. Chances of water retention increases with deranged kidney function, low LVEF.  Pioglitazone also avoided in old female due to increased risk of osteoporotic fractures. I would also like to advise 1) screening for other diabetic complications like nephropathy, retinopathy, neuropathy, foot examination.2) strict compliance with her medications (for diabetes and for heart problem - blood thinners, Beta blockers, ACEI/ARBs, Statins as advised by cardiologist) and diet.3) Regular BP check4) keep cholesterol under control (use of statins).Keeping all these fact into consideration use of insulin (for which high degree of motivation is important) is highly recommended in her along with oral medications depending on her reports after consulting with your doctor.If she is really reluctant for use of insulin other oral newer medicines like DPP4 inhibitors can be taken after consulting with diabetologist."},{"Patient":"I have been extremely busy and have forgotten to drink fluids and eat for a 8 hour stretch.

Her symptoms started with pain in right thigh after applying heat and massaging the symptoms aggravated. (Applications of heat and massaging should be avoided in Diabetes patients.) Subsequently there is decreasing knee swelling but development of swollen leg with overlying tight, brown, shiny skin. Skin changes denote possibility of cellulitis (infection) with compartment syndrome (swelling of leg muscles and other tissues underneath overlying skin leads to increase in pressure which hampers blood supply to leg.) Diabetic patients are more prone to develop foot problems because - 1) loss of protective sensation of foot (diabetic neuropathy) which make patient more prone for injuries to feet. 2) Impaired blood supply due diabetic vasculopathy, which impaires nutrition of leg. 3)Diabetes patients are more prone for infections and poor, delayed wound healing.

Could this be diabetes?","Doctor":"Hi,As you have mentioned feeling of tiredness after eating high sugar cookie.There are two possibilities for that-1) Reactive hypoglycemia:Low blood sugar level due to high sugar load (carbohydrate).This is due to rapid release of insulin in response to high carbohydrate load  which leads to low blood sugar level (hypoglycemia).Hypoglycemia usually associated with tiredness, sweating, palpitations, restlessness, unusual hunger, dizziness.2) Hyperglycemia (Diabetes- High blood sugar level)I want know 1) Any associated symptoms.2) Your height weight.3) Family history of diabetes.I will advise you to check blood sugar level during episode which will give clue to diagnosis.Depending on result further action plan can be done.If blood sugar level found low If blood sugar >70 then you can confirm diabetes by doing Oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) or HbA1c."},{"Patient":"Last year on my physical ,my blood sugar level was 5. months after that I had a terrifying experience were I couldn t stop shaking for about 45 mins to an hour afterwards. This year s physical my blood sugar level was 6.2 fasting and 7.1 after glucose tolerance test. According to my doctor a have diabetes. Is it possible that having that terrifying experience could have caused it? and is it diabetes for sure or is that borderline?","Doctor":"A 5 is great. A sugar level of 6.2 fasting puts you in the pre-diabetes range. You could be carrying a diabetes gene and that experience turned your gene on, we can only guess. You do need to take appropriate measures to lower it a bit. Take a look at your diet and get rid of junk,add healthy fruits/vegies/whole grains (especially OATS), good fats (virgin olive oil,etc) and exercise. Now, on the other hand your 7.1 you received after the 2 hour OGTT would have been closer to 7.8 for prediabetes. Ask him to do a HbA1C to cut the tie. If you do have predb, you want to nip it in the bud!!! A HbA1C should be 5.7 (optimally) to 6.4% A HBA1C of 6.5% is diagnostic of Diabetes. And, ask him specifically why he thinks 7.1 is prediabetic??He is probably translating it into blood sugar for fasting instead of looking at the cutoffs for a 75 g OGTT test. If he is confused have him refer to the January 2015 Diabetes Care issue on the new Standards of Diabetes Medical Management. It is good for you to question the descreptancies, but in the end, ask yourself if you are being given warning signs? The HbA1C should give you further information. Good luck. A good diet never hurt anyone!"},{"Patient":"Sir, I am Mrs  Vanaja Devadoss, 62 years of age, diagnosed for Diabetes II and high BP.

I went to my local Dr. and he said it could be stitched back together but it would probably come apart again. He didn't mention any other fix.

I take a lot of Vitamins and Creatine. I've had this Umbilical Hernia for about 3 years. If I'm not doing much its not very noticeable, But when I workout It is. I have almost stopped abs work because I don't know if this would make it worse. I like to lift very heavy. My bench is 315lbs for 5-8 reps and dead lift is 400lbs for 3-5 reps.

Surgery will cure the condition if you avoid doing the precipitating exercises. Any weightlifting exercise is bound to tense up the abdomen.

A blockage can also occur if one part of the intestine folds like a telescope into another part, which is called intussusceptions.

So you should be swallowing some by carbonated drinks, sodas, straw use, speaking or laughing while eating etc. So avoid these. To reduce the gas avoid cabbage, cauliflower, baked beans and broccoli and also pulses.

Taking insulin of 5units in morning, 3units in afternoon and 8units in night. What are the complications wil I face during delivery and will this diabetes continue after my delivery?","Doctor":"Hello,uncontrolled gestational diabetes may cause babies to enlarge (particularly their shoulders). This enlargement may cause trouble during delivery and increase the risk for injuries to the baby and to the mother. There are several other potential complications but this is by far the more common. Your baby's weight is not that high, so it seems that diabetes has not affected it, although ultrasound scan evidence would be needed to say that for sure. Your blood glucose measurements are high - all three of them. The target levels are:- below 93 for fasting glucose- below 130 (and preferably below 120) for postprandial (1st hour) glucoseYou haven't mentioned what insulin you're using. I suppose it has to be NPH. Correcting the fasting blood glucose would usually require increasing night insulin (and perhaps adding a snack before bedtime to avoid hypoglycemia and/or ketosis). Since the morning hormones are hindering blood glucose control, you should be more careful in what you eat for breakfast. Avoiding high glycemic index carbohydrates will help. Gestational diabetes goes away after delivery - almost always!Checking your blood sugar the very next morning will convince you about that!Gestational diabetes increases your risk for type 2 diabetes in the near future so you've got to do an oral glucose tolerance test a couple of months after delivery and every three years ever after.I hope I've helped!If you'd like more information, please contact me again.Kind Regards and good luck with your pregnancy!"},{"Patient":"I am a 23 severely overweight female.

Can any one suggest what happens when the course is dicsontinued.","Doctor":"Dear friend, firstly, do not take the disease lightly, secondly never to stop the anti TB medicines , once started . if the patient had some drug reaction, or drug induced jaundice, then de sensitization to anti TB drugs followed by full course of Rx for 6 to 9 months is necessary. stopping and restarting for no significant reason leads to multiple drug resistance, which is difficult to treat TB and the patient also spreads  the MDR TB to other innocent people. better have a follow up check with X-rays and sputum examinations if  the patient has lung TB. remember, in TB only thing that cures it is regular medicines."},{"Patient":"Hi Myself Zuber 4 Months back i was diagnosed for DiabeticMy age is 29HBA1c 8.4TriGly  580I am on medication Amryl M1 before lunchCetapin 500mg after dinnerStanlip Rosovel Statin 40 mgEcosprin 75mgMy last HBA1c was 5.7.

Cuts are healed quick quickly.I am wondering if I do symptoms of being diabetic.Many thanks.Danny LAU","Doctor":"Hello Danny,Thank you for your question.First of all let me tell you that symptoms in diabetes can be very misleading. Some patients with diabetes have no symptoms at all and some with symptoms pointing towards diabetes may have normal sugars. That is why we clinicians rely on blood sugar values alone for diagnosing someone with diabetes. So the symptoms of feeling thirsty too often (drinking lots of juices) and itchy dry skin and tingling in the toes can point towards diabetes. I would suggest you to get a blood test for the following tests: 1) Fasting blood glucose2) Post meal blood glucose after 2 hours3) HbA1c4) Renal function tests5) Liver function tests6) TSH7) Vit B12 levelsThese test results will guide us to tell whether the reason for your symptoms is diabetes or something else. You can get back to me once you get these results.Hope this helps.Take care.Dr Shreya Kunder"},{"Patient":"Hi doc, I m 27 yr old having type 2 diabetic I m diabetic when I was 18 and I reduced 7 kg weight on tat period and I was doing workout reguraly so I was normal without medication my hba1c was 5.1to 5.6 and I had normal pregnancy without diabetic and baby also normal, after my delivery it's two years now my hba1c is 6.8 and my doc gave me glyciphage 250 mg . My question is I want to have second baby and I don't want medication for diabetes , is it possible can I cure this waiting for ur reply?","Doctor":"Hello,as you've already noticed, body weight plays a very important role in blood glucose regulation. If you're overweight then loosing some Kilograms would help you reduce mean glucose values. Physical activity is a big part of diabetes treatment. It is as effective as a pill. You need to exercise daily for at least 30 minutes. You don't have to do intense exercise. Even walking a little faster than usual helps.Diet is very important as well. Avoiding food with high glycemic index and fat will help you achieve better glucose results.If you can't keep the blood sugar down to normal while being pregnant, you should receive treatment to avoid complications to the fetus. The most difficult time period comes after the 20th-24th week of pregnancy. Hormonal reasons make blood sugar regulation after that period more difficult than usual. I hope I've helped!If you'd like further information, please contact me again.Kind Regards!"},{"Patient":"hello i have a few questions from my mother inlaw who is type 2 diabetesshe takes 10 mersondol (night strength)  each day & 10 pedadine forte she has been told she has emfasima & is on insulin for her diabetes but has gained a large amount of weight from sz16 to 23 in the past 6years she has no motivation to do anything except walk outside to have a smoke every 30mins i just don't know what to do she is too embarrassed to tell a doctor about her pain killer addiction!please help","Doctor":"BOTH MEDICINES ARE PAIN KILLER,CAUSE ADDICTION,REDUCE THE DOSE SLOWLY.YOUR MOTHER INLAW CAN TAKE THE MEDICINES  WITH INSULIN.WEIGHT GAIN IS DUE TO INSULIN.DISCUSS WITH YOUR DOCTOR TO CHANGE THE ANTI DIABETIC MEDICINE THAT DO NOT INCREASE WEIGHT.RISK FACTORS ARE .1- AGE (MENOPAUSE)2-DIABETES.3-SMOKING.4-EMPHYSEMA.5-DEPRESSION6-OBESITY..QUIT SMOKING .CONSULT COUNSELOR/PSYCHIATRIST.TAKE IT SERIOUSLY.TAKE HELP OF OTHER FAMILY MEMBERS."},{"Patient":"I'm 19 and work for a lawyer and today I was feeling weird and started to doze off without knowing..

The amount of short acting insulin would depend on the amount of carbohydrates with your meal.

Only approx 20% of the tooth is visable and has been this way for about 3 years now. It is a tight seal between the tooth and the operculum which means its very difficult to keep clean, even using a syringe does not work. this is making it very prone to infection, and the smell....well lets keep this polite and say its more them embarrasing. My question to you is, what is the likelyhood that my dentist will agree to remove the operculum as i have read on alot of forums that the riskis involved with the lingual nerve are very high and the operculectomy has been removed from standard practice. Im in the UK, using a UK dentist just incase that makes a difference. I would really appriciate any help and advice you could give me. Thanks Sean","Doctor":"Thank you for your queryIn your case I must suggest that try to go to an oral surgeon and not just plain dentist.He will get orthopentomogram done(OPG). This investigation will show the angle of molar, size of root, and it also tells about the cause of impaction.Moreover the 3rd molar is more or less a vestigeal organ. It has no role in grinding or occlusion. Getting the operculectomy done might hamper your 2nd molar(if tilted)Extraction is the treatment in your case....But do consult an oral surgeon as he is an expert and prevent lingual nerve injury. The lingual nerve injury is otherwise very rare. Extraction will also prevent chronic gingivitis, which causes bad oral odour.God bless"},{"Patient":"sir i am 50 yrs old and diabetic for last 13 yrs,suffering from hypertension too.i have problem of hernia also.Recently i have nurological problem of somewhat like reeling sensation.perhaps due to medication i have got problem of GERD problem,and for that i have been using OMEZ-D.

Design your meals in such a way that your meal should contain half of green leafy vegetables, curd or any milk products but it should be prepared from skimmed milk, nuts, either take par boilled rice or multigrain chapatis. Well so far as your HIV status is concerned, kindly get your status checked too. And yes do not skip your diamicron. Also mention the dosage of diamicron.

My blood sugar control has been good,using humalog (short-acting insulin) and Lants (insulin for basal blood sugar contro),but I was in an auto accident 8 years ago. I had chronic fatigue just weeks after the accident. Many tests were done, but nothing significant was found. i have had high liver enzymes since the accident, but a biopsy showed no disease. Doctors said, Just live with it. This year i went to an osteopath, who immediately noticed my liver was congested and had structural damage. Even though my hemoglobin A1C tests have been in the mid 6 s, when i get low, my blood sugar will sometimes spike after just 5-10 grams of carbohydrates. other times I m still low after 25 grams of carbohydrates. This happens 1-2 times a week, with no triggers I can anticipate. In talking with a diabetes educator, I learned that this was probably a function of my liver being off. Is there any way I can anticipate how my liver will release sugar, or is it simply a guess and check process? I went to a new endocrinologist last week. When she looked over my labs, she said I should be referred to a liver specialist. Since my A1C levels are good, and I check blood sugars regularly, eat regularly, and do everything according o good diabetes control, she say the only variable is my liver function. She is very concerned about my blood sugar spikes and dips that don t seem to follow the rules. I take milk thistle for my liver, do liver massages and pumps my osteopath taught me, and also use creams and clay for liver support. Is there anything else you can suggest to balance my blood sugar as I get my liver healed? How long does this generally take to get a liver fully functional with enzmes in normal range? Thank you, Jayne","Doctor":"Dear friend, greeting.. I understood your problems..... I know your liver is injured and congested with inflammation .. As reflected by your elevated liver or hepatobiliary enzymes.... Plus you are a diabetes ... You need to avoid any drugs or toxins like alcohol till your liver is healthy.. Please do keep a track of your liver enzymes and blood glucose levels .. Keep checking your HbA1c every two months with LFT and lipid profile.. You can take some hepato protective drugs till it is heal s .. Eg. Sylmarin . do take more of green leafy vegetables, fruit s , oats , whole grains,  milets , fish .. That prevent s the accumulation of fat in liver too.. And also control your sugar levels .. You need to keep your self physically active at least walk for an hour a day .. Be fit and healthy ..

PCOS disappeared and little changed medically... and then she became pregnant very soon after that. With that pregnancy she was diagnosed with gestational diabetes and went on insulin. After that(Mid 07) she went back to metformin... in late 2009, she was still on metformin but doing great. She went off metformin in (Sept. 09) and her blood sugars were great... never over 115, usually 100 or lower, which she had previously been told she could never do again because once you have glucose intolerance your always diabetic . ( I should clarify this by stating she has NEVER been diagnosed type 2, she was found to have impaired glucose tolerance) Well everything was peachy until this august, early September... after a year of good health her blood sugar started rising... avg of like 140 to 150 and she was getting lethargic, so she had to go to the clinic...(no insurance) Once she revealed she had been on metformin(a year ago) the doctor prescribed her more and said he was sure it was just early diabetes... then gave an A1C on which she got 5.7... She has NEVER had an A1C over 7... either way the doctor didn’t care to figure more out... well now we re in the spot where she feels awful and her blood sugar is even HIGHER after taking metformin for a few months again. (160 to 190) So this leads me to ponder a few things... 1. If she is diabetic, how was she super healthy for a year, scored an A1C of 5.7 and didn’t even feel to sick, mainly just lethargic when her blood sugar began to rise..? 2. If she isn’tt diabetic, is taking the medicine causing unnecessary problems like that lactic acidosis (lf I m not mistaken, metformin is known to cause). 3. Is there a chance its thyroid related?. 4. What vitamins do you recommend for this sort of issue? Food intake: Shes make a lot of our own food, some even from what we got out of our garden. Water intake: She doesn’t usually drink as much as she should, she says she just never feels thirsty, and hasn t since child hood. Although she is working on drinking anyways... Exercise: She is not overly active, but not a total bum.. so moderatish( we have 3 kids to take care of) Oddities: as I stated, Sarah has never really felt thirsty, also strangely, on metformin she is now craving MORE food, especially sweets, even though metformin is used as an appetite suppressant... this side effect was not present when she was on metformin in the past. Any advice on this issue would be much appreciated. Thank you very much. Kristin","Doctor":"Dear friend .. I appreciate your concern .. I think she need yo to investigated thoroughly may require a consultation with an endocrinologist .. First get her HbA1c , fasting and post prondial glucose , lipid profile, urine for microalbuminuria and thyoroid profile too ..  fT3, fT4, and TSH .. .. That might give us the complete picture of her hormonal imbalance .. Metformin is an excellent drug for insulin resistance ..  PCOD, obesity, hypothyroidism, and diabetes all will be associated with different degrees of Insulin resistance .. So metformin can be a useful drug .. But if the sugar levels find s to be too high you need to add another oral hypoglycemic agent .. So that we should keep her sugar levels under check .. That should be our prime aim ..

I am on 30/70 human insulin and used to take 8 units every before lunch since last one and half years as prescribed by Enchronologist at Narayana Hrudhalaya, Bangalore. By the way, I am 67 years old. Before that, I used to take 3 mg Glimpiride tablet. On 08.12.2010, I put on my shoes and walked for about one and half mile. While walking I did not feel any pain in my feet. But after coming home and openining my shoes,I started feeling severe pain on the big toe of my left foot. Next day, I got my blood sugar tested and found the blood sugar Fasting 124 and PP 239. I immdiately consulted my physician and he diagnose the foot infection as pyronachia and prescribed some antiboitic tablet. Healso incresed the does of insulin taking 15 units before breakfast and 8 unit before dinner and advised me to test the blood glucose after 1 week. When I got my blood glucose tested, the fasting went upto 200 and pp 305. The doctor advised me get the infection surgically treated. So I got the ulcer operated and half of my big toe nail was cut. The surgeon prescribed me to take Percin antiboitic tabelts.After 1 week, I got my blood sugar tested and Fasting came down to 143 and PP 257. I took about 20 percin tablets but the ulcer has not yet been healed. My physician advised me to continue the percin tablets. But when I went to the surgeon for dressing, he suggested me to discontinue taking percin tablet. As the wound has not been completely cured, I consulted another Enchronlogist,who has suggested to check my pp blood sugar.Accordingly I got pp blood sugar tested and it has come down to 158.

Your blood sugars are now controlled , so continue Insulin at 15--0--8 dose only . As of your ulcer is concerned , wound healing is always delayed in diabetics.    Most common causes for delayed wound healing are uncontrolled blood sugars ( which is controlled in your case ) or persisting infection at the wound site.   Though you have taken antibiotics the infection might have not yet been cured. I advise you to get a test called Wound swab culture sensitivity test which will detect if any infection is persisting in the wound and also will give information on which antibiotic is useful for that infection. Kindly get the test done and revert back with report. Any clarifications feel free to ask. Regards."},{"Patient":"My husband has a blood sugar reading of 430.

The risk of post-splenectomy sepsis can be reduced by vaccinations and preventative antibiotics. If you were not vaccinated prior to surgery, you should arrange to get the vaccines once you have completely recovered from the operation. Haemophilius Influenzae type B (Hib), Pneumococcal vaccine, Meningococcal group A, C, Y, W135 and B should be taken. The vaccination schedule will be advised by your General Physician. You will also need either daily antibiotics or emergency antibiotics when you are unwell. That will be again prescribed by your Physician. Seek medical attention when unwell, present to your GP or nearest Emergency Department. Look for high fever, cough with phlegm, flu-like illness and sore throat. Take special care to avoid infections."},{"Patient":"How dangerous is a blood sugar level of 330?  My husband has been without metformin for about a week, but has been taking a shot and a new pill - neither are insulin, the pill helps block sugar from entering your system and the shot helps the metformin.","Doctor":"Hello,a blood sugar level of 330mg/dL causes loss of water and glucose from the kidney. This leads to dehydration. Sometimes (usually in type 1 diabetes, very rarely on type 2) it may end up in ketoacidosis. Chronic problems related to high blood glucose include diabetes complications like kidney damage (chronic kidney disease), cardiovascular complications (acute myocardial infarction, stroke, etc), neurological problems (diabetic neuropathy etc), eye problems etcI guess the injection must be a GLP-1-agonist(exenatide or similar drugs) and the pill must be acarbose. Both are good drugs against type 2 diabetes but it seems they are not sufficient for your husband and it's a strange combination too.Why did he stop metformin?

In the afternoon I have no physical strength and an exhausted. My sure levels are under good control with metformin and sliding scale on insulin. I have had several lows lately in the low 40s without changing anything. This is new and am not sure what to think about this.","Doctor":"Hello there,I can understand your concern about this fatigue due to diabetes.Fatigue in diabetes can be due to various reasons. In your case like you have already observed low sugars, that seems to be the reason why you are having less physical strength and exhausted feeling. It seems that the insulin doses you are on are higher than what you require as Metformin by itself does not cause low sugars, usually. There could be another reason for sudden low sugars while being on the same dose and that could be deterioration in your kidney functions. So I would suggest get a FBS, After breakfast, Before lunch, After lunch, Before dinner and After dinner reading for a week (one reading each day with changing timings every day) and then get kidney functions test, HbA1c to find the cause of your sudden low sugars. If there is no definite cause then there is a simple need to change your insulin doses and try to avoid low sugars. Your fatigue will get better once sugars start to be in normal range. Depending on your age and other problems like heart diseases (if any) or kidney problem (if any) your sugar level targets can be decided. Do discuss these things with your diabetologist who will make the necessary changes after seeing the reports.Till then try to eat frequent small meals so that you do not get low sugars.Hope this helps.Take care."},{"Patient":"Why have I developed freckles on the back and front of my calf.

How are hemorrhoids prevented?","Doctor":"Treatment of piles includes Medical treatment of hemorrhoids is aimed initially at relieving symptoms. The other is endoscopically or surgical treatment of hemorrhoids to shrink and destroy the hemorrhoidal tissue. Surgical and endosurgical treatment include: ?\\tRubber band ligation. A rubber band is placed around the base of the hemorrhoid inside the rectum. The band cuts off circulation, and the hemorrhoid withers away within a few days. ?\\tSclerotherapy. A chemical solution is injected around the blood vessel to shrink the hemorrhoid. ?\\tInfrared coagulation. A special device is used to burn hemorrhoidal tissue. ?\\tHemorrhoidectomy. Occasionally, extensive or severe internal or external hemorrhoids may require removal by surgery known as hemorrhoidectomy. The best way to prevent hemorrhoids is to keep stools soft so they pass easily, thus decreasing pressure and straining, and to empty bowels as soon as possible after the urge occurs. Exercise, including walking, and increased fiber in the diet help reduce constipation and straining by producing stools that are softer and easier to pass."},{"Patient":"A friend of mine is type 1 diabetic.

This will help to see the entire colon, take a biopsy from the suspected area to determine the cause.

The same problems effected my life as I was not able to concentrate on anything. I am an introvert person and I have few friends with whom I shared this problem. They tried to console but they could not give a solution. In 2011, on a roadtrip, I met with an accident in National Highways but got away with small bruises. I sometimes doubt whether I am having these problems due to the accident because I have NO memory of how that accident happened and I fell down and fainted (Even I did not feel any pain when I met with the accident) Only I could remember was that I got up myself after few minutes (It was night time so no one was around to help that time). I am afraid to open this up to my parents as I feel they will get worried too much. When I go out sometimes I get panicked as to where I am and how I ended up in that place. As a result, I always try to be aloof as much as possible. Also, I had a great vocabulary since childhood but I find it difficult to converse with anyone now a days.

If so, you have had that injury over 3 days with no other significant complication, such as vomiting, headache or dizziness etc.. Most probably the swelling might be a haematoma that resulted from rupture of some minor vessles in your scalp.

Although the vomiting has nearly ceased, the cramp is quite sharp in the lower right abdomen and feels like it radiates to the testicles (right testicle).Should I try and sleep another night or visit my local urgent care centre?","Doctor":"Hi, Noted the history about food poisoning with vomiting that has nearly ceased but there are cramps in the right lower abdomen continues with referred pain to the right testicle. This indicates that food poisoning is causing inflammation of the intestines and you need a proper clinical evaluation and examination of vitals and abdomen. Food poisoning usually has no relation to the pain in the right testicle hence the cause of the pain should also be found out. This can be due to severe vomiting causing testicular torsion due to muscular contraction of the lower abdominal muscles causing twisting of the cremaster muscles going into the scrotum that suspends testicle. The torsion can cause such a pain and needs urgent color Doppler examination if the testis needs to be saves. Early diagnosis is a must.

Once a proper diagnosis has been made the treatment will be according to the exact problem.If sprain or so, muscle relaxant, anti-inflammatory medicines, complete bed-rest and of course the most important is the control of the cough.Take products with codeine which needs a prescription as this will control cough as well as the pain.

I am taking ibuprofen and using Aspercreme which helps a lot.","Doctor":"Hello!Thanks for using healthcaremagic.comI read carefully your question and understand your concern. I think you may have a muscle contracture.As its name implies, muscle contracture is a contraction of the muscle, the harmful character lies in the continuity of this contraction in a sustained manner over time. Obviously this permanent contraction is involuntary, thus leaving the muscles in constant tension. A muscle contracts and distends, but in some cases, an area of ​​the vast muscle does not relax, and is contracted. This area remains hard and swollen, hence the patient notices a bulging to the touch, commonly called 'knot'.A contracture is not a serious injury, but it is annoying and it can prevent us from performing certain gestures normally and without pain, so we should know how to identify them, differentiate them from other problems, follow simple guidelines to minimize their effects and put them in the hands of A specialist in physiotherapy if we want to shorten recovery times, which, under normal conditions, can range from one to two weeks depending on the severity of it.Due to the mild nature of this type of ailments, the treatment of a muscular contracture is based on following simple guidelines which they can be minimized and even eliminate their effects without the need for major rehabilitations.In the first place, the logic must be applied: moving away from the injury mechanism. If an exercise or the repetition of a gesture creates a contracture, these exercises or gestures should be avoided. Rest, on many occasions, is the best method of healing.A very valid treatment in the early stages of contracture is the application of dry heat in the affected area, such as the use of electric pillows. Heat is a potent vasodilator and will contribute to the blood purification of the muscle segment, besides provoking an immediate sensation of relief by its analgesic and relaxing effect.Contrast baths are another way to alleviate the painful effects of contractures. This technique is based on the alternating use of cold water and hot water, provoking successive reactions of vasoconstriction and vasodilation, thus stimulating circulation in the treated limb.The use of pharmacology is a more aggressive, more chemical treatment, but with optimal results. Any anti-inflammatory, either oral intake or skin application, will help the recovery of the damaged area.The massages. The most effective and natural method of all the previously exposed. There is no better remedy for a contracture than putting it in the hands of a professional manual therapist to eradicate the condition.The contractures do not respond to a standard pattern as far as recovery times are concerned, being a matter of overload can not discern how long it has been loading that area. But it can be established in a generic way that a contracture already fixed can involve a work of two or three physiotherapy sessions, with their intermediate rest days and a return to mobility in a progressive way. This can take between one and two weeks from the time the contracture is treated until it is completely removed and the patient can return to his usual routine with full warranty."},{"Patient":"My.

But if you are suspicious of head trauma only a CT scan can confirm concussion or serious head injury, if this is the case appropriate physician must be consulted (Neurologist).

Read and understood your problem at the age of 60 years looking like 4 months pregnant.

Your Symptoms of pain in abdomen, bloating discomfort can be mainly die to the Anxiety and or stress, allowing you to have lots of aerophagia meaning swallowing air, you may have dentures or the change of taste for foods and soda and colas etc.Another reason can be you are taking foods with nuts or so , that give the similar symptoms.

Stop all the foods and beverages which you must have noticed to cause such symptoms and I hope you will be fine. Control of the stress and / or anxiety is the key.

My brother was in a axe accident and became permanently brain damaged so I know how delicate I can be which may be making me paranoid, I am struggling to sleep over thinking so would appreciate some reassurance or advice - thanks","Doctor":"Hello, I understand that you are worried about this issue. I would advise that you visit your doctor today or tomorrow and get this problem checked out. Seeing as you are having a headache, it is always better to be on the safe side. There is nothing to be paranoid about though, do not worry. Most likely it is a concussion but even if your doctor finds a contusion or some amount of bleeding in the cranium, he would be sure to treat you well, and the condition is very amenable to treatment, without long term sequelae in the vast majority of cases. The symptoms that you should look out for : loss of consciousness, vomiting, unbearable headache, difficulty with your vision. It is always good to know what symptoms to look out for, however it is best to visit your doctor and be on the safe side. All the best."},{"Patient":"Hi I fell backward when my child jumped off hay stack into my arms I landed square on my butt then fell all the way back still holding child up it sent an extremely odd pain through out my butt.

I was taken to the emergency room and received a good cleaning along with 2 stitches, X-rays revealed there were no objects or debris left inside the wound and my leg was not broken but had hyperextended during the crash. I visited an Orthopedic surgeon Wednesday the 29th of October where I was prescribed antibiotics but wasn't given a promise that it would prevent infection. I am in so much agony and pain as of right now, not only has the pain gotten worse but it is traveling up from my shin to my knee cap as well. I am almost 100% certain my puncture has gotten infected, I keep it clean and wrapped with gauze but it stays swollen and hot to the touch. I have become nauseous and lost my appetite these past 2 days and have noticed a bruise on the heel of my left foot which seems to grow increasingly. I did not notice the bruise until yesterday and it was dime size, now it is the size of a half dollar coin and is very purple. I am concerned I may have an infection in my bone as well because of the excruciating pain inside of my shin and knee cap now. I will call my Orthopedic Surgeon on Monday morning to schedule an appointment. What are the chances it may be developing into gangrene? Should I go ahead to the emergency room or can I wait? All other areas of my body that were injured have healed beautifully except for my left shin. Thank you so much for your time!","Doctor":"hello,It seems that you are uncertain about following.1)Whether there is any infection at puncture site?2)Bruise gone unnoticed3)Whether there is any chance to develop gangrene?4)Have to wait and watch?Answers are here..first of all u have not mentioned that whether u have been prescribed any painkillers or not. Neither you have mentioned the name of antibiotic.Now,1) If u have developed any infection at your wound site, u probably have developed fever, which u have not mentioned about.2)Bruise is called \\"delayed bruise\\" as it develops after about certain time of actual impact. If it is of purple colour, its in the phase of healing. No treatment required for that except painkillers.3)There is a chance to develop gangrene , when you leave your wound in unhygienic condition, do not take proper antibiotics, already have undiagnosed diabetes. Otherwise there is negligible chance.4)If pain is unbearable there is no choice for wait and watch.Anyway if you have consulted an ortho.surgeon , He must have given you painkillers, if surely not you should consult him.I am not suggesting you any painkiller online, because i do not know your gastric history.Get well soon."},{"Patient":"My little girl was in a four wheeler accident last night at 6:30. we went to the emergency room and she had cuts and bruises, but seem to be  ok. she just woke up from a nap and had 103.2 fever, is this something i should bring her back to the emergency room for???","Doctor":"Hi,thanks for writing in. firstly after an accident its important to review a child for post traumatic stress. it would be advisable to visit the child specialist regarding the fever. they might need to put her on antipyretics and antibiotics and probably a tetanus toxoid injection."},{"Patient":"I got hit in the head with a bottle bouncing.

His truck flipped 3 times and rode the guard rail backwards, upside down. We are thanking God that he didn't get hurt. He got out and felt ok. There was a a couple nicks on the back of his head (they thinkfrom the glass) and a small bump appeared. Paramedics checked him out and he refused to go to hosp because he felt he was ok. A miracle truly! He also went to Urgent care on way home and they also checked him over and said he was ok, to keep watch for the next 48 hrs, perscribing pain medn if needed. He hasn't been sore, no muscle aches nothing.

However, he sleeps then wakes up 3-4 hours later and can't go back to sleep so gets up. He also said today he has been experiencing nightmares (he never has them) and also prior experiences in his life have been part of these dreams.

I got treatment at the emergency room and their initial evaluation was that I didn't have any structural damage.  My wounds are just about healed and I'm not experiencing pain, but I have a patch of skin on my wrist that is completely numb to touch.  It's been like this for three straight weeks with no change.  It's located on my left wrist (on the thumb side of the palm) and starts at the base of the hand and continues down that side of my forearm about 5 inches and ends at one of the dog bites.  I'm guessing I have an issue with the nerve, but since it's not painful, and doesn't impact my mobility, what are the risks of not getting the nerve damage corrected?","Doctor":"Hello, Thanks for writing to us.According to your description of numbness, it seems that you have numbness only on some patch of your forearm. If a main nerve is damaged - it will create numbness till the end of the finger. So if your numbness is patchy - it means that only a very fine nerve branch may have been damaged, if any, which is not possible to repair. The good thing is that - nerve endings do grow back, but at slow pace, some few mm in a week. So my suggestion would be to wait, as time goes by - the nerve will regrow and your numbness will disappear. To accelerate the nerve growth and minimize the numbness - you could take vitamin B 12 supplements. They are essential in nerve repairs and may help you to recover a bit faster.Thank you."},{"Patient":"About an hour ago I had an incredibly small shock from the mains.

I was trying to open a cooker and then the hot water spilled on my face near eyebrow, side of my neck and behing my head. What treatment shud i follow? there are blisters as well. Pls advise","Doctor":"Hi ! Good morning. I am Dr Shareef answering your query. If I were your doctor, I would advise you not to puncture or debride the blisters. In case it bursts of its own, I would advise you for an antiseptic ointment to apply over it which ideally should also be safe to the eyes in case it goes inside the eye. Obviously it would be an ophthalmic ointment for the wounds and blisters near the eyebrow. In the wounds behind the neck and scalp, I would advise you to get it dressed with an antiseptic ointment at least every alternate day. Usually blisters caused by hot water are not very deep burns, and it would heal in about two to three weeks time unless it gets infected. For the pain or burning sensation, I would have advised you for any anti inflammatory drug along with a proton pump inhibitor. However, the exact way of management could be planned only after a clinical examination of the wounds and so I would also suggest you to visit your nearest hospital or family physician for a proper and safe management.I hope this information would help you in discussing with your family physician/treating doctor in further management of your problem.

Evolution may be rapid, exposing additional layers of tissue even with optimal treatment.  but in your case it is different this may be due to a blood clot or tendon injury or a small fracture any way it has to be investigated (xray,CT,MRI) before coming into a conclusion.  hope this explains in detail"},{"Patient":"I am incredibly embarrassed to admit this, but, yesterday I mixed bleach with CLR in an effort to get the litter box disinfected.

I sat outside in the freezing cold weather with my winter coat and sweating profusely. I finally stopped coughing and sweating and called poison control. They suggested I go to the ER immediately. Now for my second stupid move of the day, I decided not to go to the hospital because I didn’t want to waste a day sitting in the ER. After a shower (in another bathroom), some more fresh air, and three hours of coughing and trying to take deep breaths, I started to feel better. Now my question is, what should I be on the look out for in the next few days? I am currently on Biaxin for an ear/sinus infection…I am hopeful that will stave off a chest infection? Should I call my family GP? Should I go to non emergent care?","Doctor":"from your description it sounds like you had a sugnificant inhalation of chlorine which causes chemical burns yo your lung tissue. At this time i would recommend you continue to monitor your breathing Now if you start coughing blood or get more short of breath that you see your doctor. I hope that answers your question. please write back if i can help any further."},{"Patient":"I am in the 9th grade and i had knee surgery ladt year- i broke my leg and tore my minescus. I dont remember the name of the surgery but i do know that there is now a nail somewhere in my knee. This year i tried out for my high school basketball team and made it. My basketball coach is a also a physical therapist, so she noticed the brace i was wearing, checked out my knee and told me i should go back to see the orthopedic surgeon. After she finally convinced me to go, he told me I couldn't play, and that i had to wait a few more months for it to heal. So all i really want to know is why isnt my knee better yet, what is taking so long for it to get better, and what can i do to speed up the healing process? Another thing is i had to get an MRArthrogram of my knee to see if they could find that problem, the next day my knee was bleeding black from the place where they injected the dye, is this bad? Should i be worried?","Doctor":"You are in the rehabilitation phase after injury. The fracture was not healed properly because you may not be taken proper rest for 2months and strengthening exercises for another 2months. Now what you have to do is just isometric and avoid weight lifting. By two weeks itself you will find result. The bleading is common."},{"Patient":"good morning! my father-in-law wa bitten by a dog, the dog was completely immunized with antirabies.

Pain in the lower abdomen which increases on coughing and bending and 2. Pregnancy like feeling. Let us discuss both differently.1. The pain on coughing or bending.

In this condition one develops almost all the symptoms and signs of being pregnant, this is basically a psycho-somatic problem and need counselling and examination by a Gynecologist.

I am Dr Saumya Mittal, MD.Read your query. That is a very significant question and i appreciate your problem. I will try my best to answer your queryThe point is that what you seem to have described is an infarct. The clot may arise from some place and lodge into the brain arteries. The clot may also develop into the brain per se.the problem with the brain ischemia is that most of the procedures have to be done within the first few hours. Roughly about 6-8 hours. So if it is beyond that, the procedure may not be too helpful.As for the cost it depends entirely on the treating hospital and the setup of the hospital.I hope this helps you. Inform the reports mentioned above/if any other so I can be of help further. I have given you the answer to the maximum considering the information provided. The results of the tests could further enhance my answer to you.Please do understand that some details could be extracted from a detailed history and examination.Please feel free to ask another query.

If It was an allergic reaction it should have not been never better, but being always worse.Swollen foot can have various causes.

The skin is actually numb to the touch. Is this something I should be concerned about or just ice and take Advil?","Doctor":"This is a common problem after a trauma to the shin bone. Though you may not see bruising there is probably bruising deep under the skin. This is a self limiting problem and will gradually go away. It may take a few weeks and don't be surprised if you do see bruising later along the foot. You can continue to treat it with advil.

The most likely cause though for excessive tired and sleep is Mono. Your only treatment is rest.

The pain radiates from the lower back (12th rib / erector spinae - area) and also the shoulder (supraspinatus - area). The muscle pain ranges from stabbing to burning to tearing. Her stomach is frequently in cramps, some days you can feel/see the intestine as it makes what appears to be a spasm. The only semi acceptable solution we have found so far for her is water aerobics twice a week and physiotherapy every fortnight. Over the December period these services where not available and the pain just came back, worse than ever. Now this has been going on for 3 years, numerous doctors and bills later. Diagnosis has ranged from costochondritis, inflammation in the stomach (not a ulcer), fibromalgia, stress, 6 months anti depressants, gilberts syndrome. This ranging from doctors, specialists even homeopathic. This is just ridiculous. It has come to the stage now where she would rather just live with the pain than being given false hope and costly bills.

I can understand the plight you both must be going through. Take rest. Change the routine ans have minimal stress and anxiety are the key to the success in such cases. You can talk to the friends and family members to search a Senior Physician who can examine you thoroughly, investigate you as per the history and the previous reports and findings. The mainstay of the treatment is the diagnosis; once made treatment will be easy and specific. you have already been diagnosed and treated for : costochondritis, inflammation in the stomach (not a ulcer), fibromalgia, stress, 6 months anti depressants, Gilberts syndrome.The muscle pains which you have described must be from the repetitive stress syndrome as per the locations; you can consult an Orthopedic Surgeon and get local steroid injections in the painful spots and  your problem may be solved,. She also has intestinal obstruction and that is the reason for the visible peristalsis and most probably causing malabsorption syndrome causing rest of the problems. I would advise you the following:MRI of the painful area and the whole spine to see whether there is a primary spinal cord syndrome causing all other symptoms. Standing X-ray of the abdomen and CT scan of the abdomen to to see for intestinal obstruction , possibility of the intestinal tuberculosis or any other problem; upper GI and Lower GI Endoscopy; if required diagnostic laparoscopy.

Thank you","Doctor":"Hi.Thanks for your query.You have a very specific history of pain in the upper abdomen which increases on walking or laying on side, without any nausea or bathroom related problems. This in fact can be a sore peritoneum due to inflamed intestine or lymph nodes in the said area or colitis of the transverse colon. Get a course of an antibiotic and anti-inflammatory medicines for 5 days, see the results; take strict bed rest and be on liquid diet. If there is no response please follow this:Consult a Surgical Gastroenterologist., get a clinical examination done and the investigations as suggested by Him likeRoutine tests of the blood, urine and stool, Ultrasonography and CT scan if needed of the abdomen.Colonoscopy if warranted.-This will give the proper diagnosis which is the most important part of any treatment."},{"Patient":"collided with my friend playing softball.

Usually the hematoma/bruise if not oozing blood actively would resolve in three to four weeks time. However if it constantly increases in size, this could be a sign of an active bleeding, and I would suggest you to get your self evaluated by a general surgeon, who might plan to aspirate the hematoma and apply a pressure bandage. He might even plan more invasive procedure if need be in case of any signs of continuing active bleeding in the hematoma. Till then I would advise you to go for an anti inflammatory drug along with a proton pump inhibitor for symptomatic relief.I hope this information would help you in discussing with your family physician/treating doctor in further management of your problem.

The cause of the injury  would not be possible to judge in this case as he is a small child and would not be able to express himself properly.

My daughter was in car wreck. Injury around the right eyebrow which was deep. You could see the bone. But zero bruising, no lump, not even a black eye. This all happened on July 2nd. The ER dr put approx 12 stitches and sent her on her way. No cat scan or MRI was done. About 2 days after she started having numbness from injury up to the top of her forehead. Which our regular Dr. Said was normal nerve damage. Her stitches were removed 6 days after. Now approx 9 to 10 days later she is having headaches. They start in the morning and stay with her all day until bedtime. She wakes up without them until she starts getting around. They are not super painful but naggy all day headaches. Any suggestion??? Is this normal or should she get it checked out ASAP?? Also we are flying out to the Caribbean on 23rd. Would it hurt for her to fly??","Doctor":"Hi ! Good afternoon.

This is the reason your doctor suggests steroid injection (near the scar i  believe) before operating. This would decrease the chances of repeat keloid formation. Though that is always a possibility and steroids are not fail-proof. As far as the steroids is concerned, adequate dose adjusted according to child's age and weight shall be given.You might want to meet any good plastic surgeon to excise the same."},{"Patient":"hi i injured my knee 6 weeks ago playing football,it has been diagnosed as crutiate injury and i am waiting for a scan,the knee is still slightly swollen and does not seem to be improving,i am icing and massageing,is there anything else i can do to improve the situation,i am 44 10stone and fairly fit thankyou","Doctor":"First of all you need to shows yourself to an orthopaedic specialist. Stop massaging the joint and weight bearing on that particular leg.MRI is a preferable scan to see knee joint pathology, specially ligamental and meniscal tears if any and which may be treated by medications, physiotherapy or orthoscopy in most of the cases.Depending on the type of injury and extent of injury, knee joint takes time from 3 to 6 weeks to improve and it generally takes months to regain the full strength."},{"Patient":"My 2 year old fell off her sister s back and landed on the area under the chin.

So some testicular pathology that has been resulted from the trauma event, is there. Now all the tests came negative, it means there's nothing serious or something that may need emergency evaluation. Now in this situation, i would suggest, pain killers, cold packs and testicular support, as he is already doing.

Depending upon the nature and function of fractured bone, the duration of plaster is decided. For example, tibia, which bears larger portion of weight of the body, needs much time to heal, Fibula on the other hand, supports the tibia and provides more stability to ankle joint. Usually bony callus formation completes within four weeks, and after four to six weeks, cast is removed. Healing may not complete by four weeks but weight bearing starts the process of remolding. Remolding is a process in which the portion of bone that bear more stress becomes more stronger. So you may remove the cast after four weeks, and start to put weight. But avoid intense activities for at least two months. Kind Regards. Dr Adil"},{"Patient":"My 8yo son has several bruises over his body after attending rugby league training - there is dark red, purplish coloured bruise with a white centre on the inside of this leg in line with his knee cap.

I was in a car wreck 10 years ago and the hospital did MRIs CT scans, etc. They said that they were surprised that my neck wasn t broken because I wasn t wearing a seat belt. I do not wear seat belts because they hurt my shoulder and cause my arm and hand to go numb. The hospital sent me a report stating that I have a birth defect that caused me to have two cervical ribs. My mother said that the hospital has to be wrong that I was born with no birth defects. When I was in third grade I was tested and taken out of regular classroom because I tested 190 on the IQ test. I am 5 8 and weigh 110 lbs. I have never had the flu, chilhood illnesses, fever blisters, or bruises. My body temperature is always low. I have always had headaches.

Who can help me?","Doctor":"HelloI am Dr Adil Thank you for asking the question.Having cervical ribs isn't a major deformity or disease. and these are the cervical ribs that are causing all the numbness of your hands and arms when you wear a seat belt. The problem is, cervical ribs tend to compress the nerves of brachial plexus, that control the sensations of your arms and hands. Compression of brachial plexus by cervical ribs, become more severe by wearing seat belt. So this is one problem. You may consider removal of cervical ribs by surgery, consult a surgeon.Moreover, as far as your other problems are concerned, I must say that, one can't give you a better opinion or advice without asking more questions and examining you, especially you motor and sensory system of all the limbs.

I did have an xray done, and it s fine. My GP said that it is just some soft tissue injury and it may take about 6 weeks to heal, is that true? Should I wait that long or should I see a specialist? I am just so worried that there is something seriously injured, as I cannot straighten it.","Doctor":"Hello.I am Dr Adil Ramzan.Thanks for asking question.Injury to knee or bones, takes time to heal. How much time an injury takes to heal, depends upon the extent of injury. Cells of the body, takes 24 hours to divide. one cell become two in twenty-four hours, two become four in next twenty four hours and four become eight and eight sixteen and so on. Now the healing period depends upon the extent of injury. If injury is severe then it takes longer time. If your x ray is normal and there's no bone and articular pathology then you shouldn't worry. Take anti-inflammatory drugs and follow your GP's advice. But it's always better to consult a specialist and have his opinion for your own wellness.

In a dirt bike accident, I had a open fracture of my tibia, my fibia was broken in 2 places and my inside ankle bone broke completely off. My left ankle was dislocated as well, and tibia was displaced. I had a pressure sore on ankle as well to the bone where after surgery the cast was directly on my incision for the ankle part. I still do PT, on my own as is I don t the scar tissue is so bad it effects ROM. And aches horribly. I have to have my Husband pull my ankle to relieve pressure. I am a nurse and have 5 kiddos, I am on my feet a lot. I had 2 pins in my ankle to put it back in place, it is numb due to the scar tissue and damage from pressure sore. The soft tissue around ankle gets very swollen and sore still. But the main issue (after all that back ground) :) is my leg bone where the plate and 10 screws are, hurts SO bad. It aches, like a bad tooth ache. I cant rest my left leg on the outside where plate is on my other leg. The pressure is too much. If I am up walking or doing a different ROM, it burns and aches. When it is cold, I have to wrap up my leg in a heating pad. It doesn t hurt per se, but aches and aches and aches. I am worried about the stress to the bone, if it could be shifting and putting more stress on the ends where the plate ends. I am very active and I worry about hurting the bone further. I do smoke cigars, which I know inhibits bone growth. And my mother has osteoporosis. This is the second time I have broken this anke, first time was a simple break. It too 2 months longer to grow bone with this injury than normal, the doctor didnt remove my cast untill much later. I am wondering if I am a candidate for metal plates and screw removal? Or would than weaken my bone further? I dont race Motocross anymore, but I do hike, water ski, swim, etc right now, the ache gets bad, Is there hope? Thanks so much for a reply in advance! I am 36, btw if that helps. Too young to be laid up!","Doctor":"You may be right to think for removal of plate.A check x ray will reveal the position if bone is consolidated, removal of the plate and scews may be undertaken. so get back to your treating surgeon and leave it to him to decide."},{"Patient":"i hit head first wakeboarding 3 days ago, I was shaking for about ten minutes afterwards but then seemed fine the rest of the day. however as of yesterday I have a terrible headache,and feel very nautious. I am very sensitive to light and sound. what should I do?","Doctor":"Thank you for your question.The symptoms you describe sound most likely like what is referred to as post-concussive syndrome.  After a concussion the area takes time to heal like a bruise on any other part of your body.  Migraine-type headaches are not uncommon.  We typically see these symptoms resolve in less than a week; if it goes on any longer, gets worse, or you develop new symptoms seek medical attention to rule out any significant injury.  In the mean time, we recommend rest, staying hydrated, and an over-the-counter pain reliever."},{"Patient":"about 15 minutes ago, my 12 year old daughter thinks she swallowed a Cherry Stone, i m worried because she says that she doesnt really know if she did or not. if she did would this cause any problems? i have heard that cherry stones have cyanide in them, but only a small amount. please could you tell me or not if it will do any damage?","Doctor":"Hi,I can reassure you that this will not cause any problems.

Medically we call it Pica. Pica is generally a symptom of anemia, either iron, zinc or Vitamin deficient. I would suggest you get a complete blood checkup done, to exclude anemia. If anemia is confirmed, treatment will range from a daily dose of supplementation, to blood transfusion, depending on your levelsIf not anemia, then the craving could be related to another condition named obsessive compulsive disorder, in which the underlying emotional factors, if any, need to be addressed. Excessive ice cravings can also lead to weight fluctuations. So please do check up on that.Hope this helps."},{"Patient":"Hi, my friend kicked my leg while we were playing football, and he hit slightly above my toe. its been a week, the swell went down but there is still pain.

If you hurt your head and had any loss of consciousness or vomiting then a CT scan of the skull is also recommended.The soreness of the muscles and areas where you got hurt will be relieved by taking painkillers.

The new tissues will take some time to get back to same level of strength that was there in unharmed part. This might result in occasional pain, especially with high intensity workout.

You need to rule out a fracture if pain is severe, and ankle fractures are a bit tricky in their recovery. You would be advised to get X ray done. If the pain is bearable and mild, there may be some ligament injury, which requires local application of diclofenac gel and some crepe bandaging."},{"Patient":"A few days ago there was what appeared to be a bug bite on the back of my ankle.

What else should she do?","Doctor":"Hi I'm Dr NallammaiWelcome to HCMThe good thing about the injury is that she has not vomited which is one of the warning sign to do CT to rule out any hemorrhage..As there is swelling it is wise to consult an orthopedician and X-ray should be taken to rule out any fracturesI wanted to know whether she had loss of consciousness which is again a sign of hemorrhageOtherwise nothing to worry about injuryAsk her to take T.combiflam 1-0-1 and T.Rantac 1-0-1 for 2 days..for pain relief"},{"Patient":"Hi  well I was playing bball two weeks ago and rolld my ankle went tothe hosp and.got xrays  they said it was a.very bad sprain   and told me what to do  so nowmy.ankle isnt swollen anymore  and I.still have a great deal.of.pain in the tendons behind my.heal and on the sides of.my.ankle.

First and foremost thing you do is give rest to your foot by strapping and keep it raised. Analgesic antiinflammatories are to be taken.cold  compression to be given. It will take little time to heal as it seems to be tortured. If takes more than a week or ten days go for MRI for appropriate diagnosis. Take care."},{"Patient":"Hello i fell down my stairs at home about three weeks ago. I went to A&E via an ambulance after passing out in pain. I had X-ray of spine, stated no injuries sent on my way although I was still in a lot of pain which was excruciating when I sat up. I went for a follow up appointment with a consultant after they reviewed my xray. I am still experiencing pain in my ribs when I breathe, especially when deeply. I am also experiencing pain in my left shoulder blade which is constant and I am constantly swallowing pain killers. Any advice as to what you think I might have done, how long it will last for please?","Doctor":"Did you have x-rays of your shoulder blade and ribs specifically? Special views need to be taken to be accurate. Sometimes rib fractures are difficult to see on the x-ray and extra views are needed. If you didn't have the special x-ray views, I suggest you ask about them. You could still have a rib fracture, and these can cause problems for several weeks. A shoulder blade fracture is very uncommon but given the degree of your pain I would want to check for it. Again, these type of x-rays must be specially requested. Hope this helps."},{"Patient":"Hi, last night my 30 year old daughter was bitten by a rescue dog she is fostering.  The dog had gotten a rawhide treat off the floor that was given to the other dog.  My daughter tried to pull the treat out of his mouth and he bit her.  His tooth went completely through her fingernail.  She nearly passed out from the pain.  She got in touch with her doctor this morning and they said all she needs to do is get a tetnus shot.  Are they correct?  Thank you for your help.","Doctor":"Yes, only a tetanus shot is necessary. She should watch the bite for any signs of infection. If it develops, she will need antibiotics.

My uncle who is a pediatrician has advised me not to eat non-vegetarian food (including eggs) for two months. As per him, eating non-vegetatian food immediately even after the last dose of Rabipur injection might annule or reduce the effect of the injection (to produce anti-bodies). Could you please provide your suggestions on this.","Doctor":"Hi I am Dr.NallammaiWelcome to HCMSome doctors advice so..

I spoke calmly to myself and focused on not passing out and shortly everything came back to normal. I felt a bit queasy for a bit but soon everything settled. I didn't loose that much blood, although I hadn't eaten breakfast. Nothing like this ever happened before. Do you know what this was? and why?

So I ve been home 5 days and the swelling has not gone done, it itches and sore to the touch. Should i go have it looked at now or wait.","Doctor":"Hello,Thanks for your query.I am happy to help you here.Today is 22nd of july.If you have swelling till today, then its better to have a follow up. Usually snakes are non poisnous. But if snakes are poisnous usually its either cardiotoxic or neurotoxic & sometimes both. Swelling doesnot confirms that the snake was toxic, but it needs attention further. Although its rare that toxin will show its action after 15 days but untill the swelling subsides u need to be kept on watch. 4 vails of antivenom may not be sufficient if aknowledgeble symptoms appear, & if no symptoms appear, you may not need anti venom at all, but for that you should be kept in watch for atleast three days. Even if just swelling appears its considered safe to administer antivenom, some patient body react to antivenom and cant  be continued further.I dont think you are in trouble of having activation of toxin but still you should keep watch on yourself for following things untill the swelling subsides.1) If either or both eyelids starts drooping or you develop difficulty in opening eyes.2) or if you develop numbness (decrease/loss of sensation on touch.) 3)Any kind of unnatural bleeding from nose or in stool etc.if any of above complaints develop then its must to revisit ER. At the time being I recomend you to take antibiotics and antiinflamatory medication to prevent infection , decrease itching and to decrease the swelling.For now I suggest you to either have a follow up or you can take some medications as bellow.Chymoral forte once dail before food for 1 wk ( it will help to decrease swelling )Tab levocet 5mg 1 at night before sleep for 3 days ( to decrease itching )Tab metronidazole 400mg thrice daily for 5 days.Tab cefixime 200mg twice daily for 3 days.I hope my talk would be helpful.

A broken bone is unlikely but can't be totally ruled out without an x-ray. If the impact of the screwdriver was strong enough, it could damage the underlying bone without causing much of a surface cut.

What else should we apply to decrease the swelling?The swelling has gone down but he still have a big soft bruise and we have place a heat pad on his head and he is taking some motrin.  What else should we apply to decrease the swelling?","Doctor":"You should be using ice, not heat, at this time. It takes a few days for the swelling to decrease. Motrin can be used for pain and headaches, but it will notheal the bruise itself. That is a matter of time and the body's efficiency at healing itself, which is usually pretty good in children.  Keep a close eye on him the next couple of days to be sure he doesn't develop any symptoms suggesting a more serious injury. He should be seen at emergency if he develops excessive sleeping, severe vomiting, change in personality, weakness or numbness on one side of the body, severe persistent headache, difference in size of the pupils, anything that looks like a stroke. These could indicate that the injury has affected the brain. Most kids do well with injuries like this and feel better within a day or two.

Things to do:1)Bed rest, hydration and good nutrition can aid in faster healing.2)Take pain killers as advised by the pediatrician as it has dose as to be calculated and given as per body weight.3)He can b given serriopeptidase to reduce the swelling.4)Cold compression will help.5) if head ache is persisting and any sins of head injury ( loss of consciousness, vomiting, giddiness, seizures) occur report to the hospital immediately."},{"Patient":"Hello Doctor.

He was airlifted to a trauma facility. After being evaluated he has no brain or spine injuries. He has broken ribs, broken metatarcel(spelling?) and his skin completely burned off on his heel. They just graphed some skin back on last night. This morning they took him off the ventilator and now he's running a fever with swelling and high vitals. What does this mean?","Doctor":"It is fortunate he has no brain or spine injuries. Broken ribs are a serious injury but they do heal Usually no specific treatment is needed. However, people with broken ribs have a lot of pain, and they tend not to take deep breaths. Because of this they are prone to pneumonia. Being on a ventilator also predisposes one to pneumonia. The fever suggests some sort of infection; my first thought would be pneumonia. He also could get infected through the skin from the trauma he experienced. You don't mention what is swollen, but skin areas swollen and red indicate infection. Generalized swelling of the body could result from an air leak in the lungs from the trauma and broken ribs. His doctors are surely aware of these possibilities and will treat them appropriately. Hope this helps.

In such injuries the damage is due to injury to the muscles and nerves. So the movements become painful and restricted. So, at this time a consultation with a ortho / phsio would be helpful, as a diagnosis is essential. You are doing well with rest and heat to the part. But gentle exercises must be started such as taking the arm out, small circular movements with the arm hanging in front of the body, taking the hand to the back of the neck, You will agree that these are best demonstrated and taken up in a gradual manner.To help in local repair you may use Diclofenac cream massage, three times a day after local fomentation.

There is no sac around any spleen so far. So there is no chance of having fluid draining from such a thing. Well, CT scan has shown white spots on the spleen. This indicates that the reason can be cancer, tuberculosis, infarct and so on. A proper evaluation, the causes and the after effects of this appearance can decide the future course.

The causes of the bloating of the abdomen alone can be as follows :Gaseous distention of the small and / or large intestines due to a variety of causes, most common being the sub-acute intestinal infection.

This can be the reason for acidity, pains, pain in waves as you have explained. I would advise you the following:First of all get the following simple tests:X-ray of the abdomen in the standing position to see whether this is due to the gases or something else. Ultrasonography will help for other causes, organomegaly meaning enlargement of the vital organs as liver and so.

I've tried eating egg beaters, but it happens just the same.  I can eat other regular foods, but eggs.  After 5 yrs now, I concluded that i'm allergic to eggs - which baffles me.  Is there something else really going on in my stomach that i'm not aware of that would do this?  I read that ulcers could cause these kinds of symptoms. What possibilities could cause this?","Doctor":"Hi.Thanks for your query.The most probable cause of pain in abdomen after eating an egg sandwich are : Now you have developed an intolerance to the egg-protein. Hence in spite of what type of egg preparation you eat you are going to have the pains and spasm .These is nothing to be baffled about. May people get allergy to different types of proteins like for the fish and nuts. No, ulcers do not cause such symptoms, please do not be under wrong impression. The only treatment is not to have eggs in any form  again.."},{"Patient":"I am a paramedic and was out partying with some friends Friday night.

Compression of nerve fibers and blood vessels due to maintenance of incorrect posture.2. Entrapment of nerve fibers at the Lumbosacral spine or lower limbs.3.

If a rectal foreign body is present, the sooner it is removed the better.I am sorry to tell this but you should go to hospital because since you have tried to pull the object out and you have failed,now it is not recommended to try other dangerous methods at home,you can injure the rectum or you can push the object higher into the colon while attempting to remove it.I suggest to go to ER as soon as possible because prompt removal is advisable.Now you should think about your health and don't put yourself in danger.You should think that the doctors see cases like yours or worse every day. Delayed removal of rectal foreign bodies can lead to severe complications, including the following:perforation ,peritonitis ,infection,mucosal ulcerations, obstruction ,bleeding.Hope my answer has helped.Take care and good luck.Dr.Rovena"},{"Patient":"So I fell of a four wheeler yesturday and hit my head pretty hard and blacked out for a second. Now part of my jaw under my ear is a little swollen and hurts when touched. Also my neck is really sore when I turn my head. What can I take to ease the pain or should I just rest?","Doctor":"Hello, I hope I can answer your question.I'm sorry to hear about your accident as it sounds like you hit yourself pretty hard.A few things that you tell me concern me.1. You blacked out. Any \\"blacking out\\" means that you have minor brain damage and in the very least a concussion.2. Your neck pain. Falling can hurt you neck and even though you may not feel pain now, your neck may be in spasm and you may have an underlying injury.3. Your jaw pain under your ear. This may represent anything from a bone bruise, to a cracked jaw to a skull fractue.As such, you probably should be evaluated to determine the extent of your injury.I hope this helps."},{"Patient":"Looking to bring my 85yr old mom to traditional med ms for dx and poss tx. She has only seen a naturopath in the last 20 yrs she is very paranoid and has hallucinations. Takes multiple supplements for lupus Rx by naturopath. Not wandering as yet. At no awake and belligerent at times. She lives with my sister in an addition attached to the house all one level. Thinks the public comes in and steals her toilet paper so she hoards it in her closets and under the kitchen table. I am concerned because in the event of her death that she will be recusitated despite the fact that she does not want this she does not have a portable DNR order at her house. Any suggestions.? Thanks so much for your time.","Doctor":"Hello, I hope I can help you with your problem. The rules surrounding your question may vary state by state, but the essential idea behind these laws is the same. That is, if a person has a DNR order, and a hospital is aware of it (they have the document), then the patient cannot be intubated. Now, that is not to say that it does not happen, and usually people will err on the side of caution by intubating everyone.As such, you need to do all you can to make sure that you take care of this situation before it becomes a problem. Usually you can speak with a doctor about the appropriate steps to take. Usually this means that one of the other family members will need to be legally responsible for your mother if she is not able to make her own decisions.The issue of medical competence is not something for a doctor to decide, but a court, and that is where your issue becomes tricky and it really depends on state law. If she has drafted such a document in the past, you need to do all you can to get one. If not, you may need to talk to an attorney as well.I hope this helps."},{"Patient":"i recently slammed face first into a parked truck and had a cut above my eyebrow, a cut below my eye and bled out my nose, i am still numb on that side of my nose, top part of my mouth and teeth and a bit under my eye, should i get the feeling back or have a destroyed a nerve, it was worse and has gotten a bit better its been about 2 and a half weeks ago","Doctor":"Hello, I hope that I can help answer your question. I think you are correct in your assumption that you damaged a nerve. The branches of the fifth and seventh cranial nerves supply the face. These nerves can be damaged either directly (as in you crushed the nerve during the accident), or they can be compressed by swelling of the tissues of the face.Either way, the feeling will probably come back. Any Nerve, outside of brain/spinal cord, can regenerate, but it often does so quite slowly. For example, for nerves above the shoulders, they grow about 1/5-1/2 mm per day.As the sensation returns to your face, you should experience so increased tingling in the areas that may be quite annoying. But don't worry, this is part of the healing process."},{"Patient":"i am suffering with severe lower abdominal pain from 15 days.i go through all tests like vaginal/uretor infections or fibroids.doctors said there is uterus swelling and suggest me laroscopy/laprotomy.but i ma much scared with this.i need general medical cure for my problem.nd dont want operation of any kind pls suggest me what should i do.i am on painkillers now from 15 days and condition is so serious that i cant move,walk or go to washroom without painkillers.i have taken antibiotics also but it is un effective.pls suggest wt should i do?","Doctor":"Hi.Thanks for your query.First of all remember that the medical field is evidence based. You have got severe lower abdominal pains and the Doctor has already suggested for swelling of the uterus and needs removal.

It is pretty severe but his ct s are good and his bleeding in the brain area has stopped. His facial fractures do not need surgery. 2 days later he is spitting up blood.

I am happy to hear that his head CT is normal.In regards to the spitting up of blood, this may entirely normal after facial fractures. The tissues of the nose and mouth are very rich in blood supply and they may bleed very easily. What is more important is how much blood he is spitting up and if it is continuos.Persistent bleeding can lead to low blood pressures as well as the possibility of swallowing the blood into the lungs causing respiratory problems. If there is just minimal blood streaking, no dizziness and no breathing problems, I'm not too worried about it. He may spit out blood clots for a few more days.As I said, if her develops constant bleeding or problems catching his breath, you need to go to the hospital."},{"Patient":"Is it dangerous to eat a dish that was accidentally baked with a plastic wrap still on it (with foil covering over the plastic)?

Extremely fit. He runs 15 miles like it's nothing. Yesterday he went on a standard 17-mile training run. He made it five miles and pretty much crashed. He tried to tough it out, but actually ended up getting severe diarrhea and passing out on the side of the trail for a while. He almost had to crawl the last 7 miles to his car. He says he was well hydrated. He was careful about his salt levels. He ate a good breakfast, and he eats plenty of meat (chicken, fish, beef etc). When I got home from work, he was curled up on the couch, shaking and taking frequent, sharp, shallow breaths. I asked to take him to the ER and he refused. He fell asleep for 2 hours, breathing that way, and when he woke up, he started crying(He does not cry)! He seemed to get his energy back, but this morning, the effort of getting ready for work left him short of breath, and he was complaining of abdominal pain. He went to work anyway.

So keep using ointment.These measures will help your wound heal faster.1. Kindly keep your wound clean and dry, since an infected wound will take more time to heal. 2. See if there are any contaminants in the wound preventing healing.3. Wash your wounds with antiseptic solution, dry it with cotton and apply ointment as much as required.4.

They ran more tests said everything was fine....gave him some pain medication and sent him home. He is not fine. I am concerned there is injury to his spleen that is not showing up on the CT.

As there is low chance of spleen injury, when not identified with CT scan abdomen.CT scan abdomen with a thorough examination will help your doctor to diagnose spleen injury.It is possible that pain your son experiencing is due to other injuries he has sustained.Spleen injury and spleen rupture may lead to bleeding into abdominal cavity.Hence you can keep monitoring your son for symptoms such as giddiness, increased heart rate, difficulty breathing. If symptoms appear seek medical attention.Hope I have answered your query.

Hi.The stress and the anxiety itself increase the acidity and gastrointestinal symptoms. The best and the most simple way to get a proper diagnosis is not by discussion or assumptions particularly when there is a family history of Stomach Cancer. Simply get the Upper GI Endoscopy , Biopsy and CT scan of the abdomen to confirm or rule out the presence of stomach cancer.

A week after the accident, when I tried to go back to teaching, I couldn t look at a screen or read without feeling nauseous. Followed up with orthopedist and was told I had post-concussion symptoms, but hospital never told me I had a concussion, though I kept telling them my head hurt. I ve been seeing chiropractor for about 3 weeks. Constant pins and needles were relieved by chiropractor for a time, but then got worse, and then better, but still there. Just had brain MRI ordered by neurologist. No results yet, but wants to do a nerve conduction study too. I m not sure why. I am 47 year old woman in otherwise good health. On neurologist s advice, once concussion symptoms went away (6 weeks after accident), I went back to normal life, but I still can t sleep well because my legs and arms go to sleep and/or tingle all night, and cannot be comfortable in any position for long.","Doctor":"Yes. Gett nerve conduction study done. It will be useful. I would advise you to start Tab Gabaneuron once daily which is a combination of gabapentin and methyl cobalamine.  It will improve the nerve symptoms.also start physiotherapy from a trained physiotherapist. It will help.You have to adhere with the treatment for a long time.

Since calf region is weight bearing area you need to keep sutures for 14 days. After that if there is no infection or redness then sutures will be removed.

It compressed my leg hard but did not break bones nor cut through the skin. However, my entire leg from the knew down, calf, ankle and big toe (top and bottom) swelled and are black and blue and I feel areas of hardness in my calf. The blood seems to be deeper below the skin and not risen to the exterior skin layers. Although there are signs of black n blue coming to the surface, it has not in its truest form yet. My ankle and calf on my right leg is noticeably swollen to my left leg (which is normal and did not incur injury). It does not hurt really now 6-7 days later, but there is soreness.

By morning, it recedes a bit but swells again throughout the day. I am unable to wear closed toe shoes at this time because of the swelling/discomfort. I also feel a little numb around my knee area. The weight of compression, being wedged between 2 car doors, on my leg from the knee down has certainly done some damage.

He has been applying Voltaran for temporary relief, and Ibuprofen/Paracetamol - however the pain seems to persist. He will have it properly examined when he returns home from travelling, however would you have any suggestions that may give him more relief? Does this sound as if it is whiplash or something more severe?","Doctor":"Hello dear,Since your dad is having stiff neck along with crunching noise on movement  following a fall,some bone injury(obviously minor) is likely.You please get an x-ray,and get it examined.Meanwhile,applying a cervical collar may help a little.And,minimize neck movements and avoid extremes of movement(very important).Most of such minor injuries can be managed conservatively though it may take few weeks for complete resolution.I hope you will find this information useful.Thank you."},{"Patient":"I had an accident 2 weeks ago. A truck passed a red light and hit my car. I hit my had on the headrest and did not think it was a big deal.  Now I have a dull, sometimes throbbing pain (not acute) on the right back of my skull.

When I fell, I was anticipating hitting the bed, and did not immediately try to catch myself, unfortunately, my head hit hard directly on the sharp corner of the bookcase, probably one of the hardest I have had. I did not black out, but my ear became numb, and my head/shoulders hurt terribly. Then, throughout the week, I have been so tired, sleeping a lot more than I ever normally would, along with a dull head headache. On Friday, when I walked out into the cold, the spot on my head immediately began to throb. I instinctively reach to touch it, and it was very tender to the touch. It eventually subsided, but I have remained since then for the last two day with a dull head ache, achey shouders/neck, and my ear on that side seems to hurt, almost like when you are beginning to get an ear infection. Its hard to tell if I am just getting sick, or should I go to the doctor because of the injury to the head?","Doctor":"Good evening sir, The symptoms you have explained may be due to lots of reasons, but, your primary concern should be to get yourself evaluated by a neurologist, so as to rule out any kind of brain injury, which might be a minimal shock to the brain to a severe extra dural heamatoma, such signs often are accompanied along with head injury, so please take good care of yourself and consult a neurologists as soon as possible."},{"Patient":"I suffered an accidental kick to the head...above right eye area a few weeks ago at work.

My stomach is also very upset like I am going to vomit but yet I am not actually getting sick...is this a result of my injury or perhaps just the seasonal sickness?","Doctor":"Hi,It is unlikely that the kick to your head would be causing a headache and dizziness. It is more likely that you have a viral illness causing these symptoms including the nausea you are suffering.However, very rarely a head injury can lead to a bleed which may cause a headache and dizziness. I suggest, if your headache does not resolve in a few days you go to the ED. You may need a brain CT to exclude an injury.Regards,Dr K A Pottinger"},{"Patient":"My son is 11 years old and plays football. He was at practice today and got tackled.

Good evening. I am Dr Shareef answering your query.If the hydrocele is getting reduced on lying down, it could be a congenital hydrocele or an inguinal hernia both of which could only be diagnosed by a physical examination. If it is a mild hydrocele, with an anti inflammatory, you might have to go for an antibiotic as well to get a relief which might take about two to three weeks. A good scrotal support would also add to an early  improvement. If it turns out to be a hernia, this has to be assessed by a general surgeon in your area followed possibly with an operation.I hope this information would help you in discussing with your family physician/treating doctor in further management of your problem.

I now have a large ish bump on the same spot where I injured it in the crash. It is very painful. And slightly swollen. Any ideas about why?","Doctor":"Hello dear,The lump formation after injury is due to accumulation of fluid & blood and it is called Hematoma.The blood cells accumulated are eventually broken down and absorbed in the body.But this is a slow process & takes times to disappear completely.Till that time, symptomatic relief is obtained by ice compression, adequate rest & analgesic preparation like Diclofenac+ Serratiopeptidase.If symptoms still persist, kindly consult an Orthopedician for proper clinical examination.X ray of the affected leg will be helpful to rule out any fracture or other pathological causes.Wishing you a Good Health.Take care."},{"Patient":"A friend of mine asked me to look this up for her.
