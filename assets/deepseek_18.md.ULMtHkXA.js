One week a go I was rushed into hospital with high blood pressure of 180/100 and put on a drip etc to calm down. I have suffered similar attacks for about 2 years since I moved from England to Mexico. I often have panic attacks and this seems to cause the high blood pressure. The problem I have now is that every time I panic I think that I am going to have a heart attack which makes me panic further and I end up back in a hospital bed. The doctors did a basic electrical scan of my heart and found nothing at the time. I have lowered my sodium intake since and tried to reduce stress. I was given some pills to help with the process of recovery. The pills do help and my blood pressure seems to be lower, it can now go as long as 88/45, but in an instant of panic it can rise very high and stay there for long periods until I try and calm myself or visit a doctor. I´m only 27 years old and I am beginning to be scared every time I miss a breathe. Is there anything more I can do? Do I need to see an expert? I am living in Mexico and everything is expensive and I´m finding things difficult.","Doctor":"Hello, Regarding your concern, I would explain that these spikes in blood pressure values are related to the panic attacks and they do not need to be treated with anti-hypertensive therapy. As you refer your actual blood pressure values are too low. For this reason, I would not recommend taking anti-hypertensive therapy. Coming to this point, I would recommend trying to focus on your anxiety. Yoga and meditation can help in this regard. If this does not help, I would recommend consulting with a specialist of the field (psychotherapist or psychiatrist). In the meantime, I would recommend taking a low dose of propranolol during panic attacks in order to prevent further increase in blood pressure values. Hope I have answered your query.

My initial reaction was that I might have the Herpes Simplex but the characteristics weren’t exactly the same as “Fever Blisters” Do you have any thoughts to what my conditions may be?","Doctor":"Hi Thanks for the query. It seems that the symptoms of pain around the wisdom tooth along with headache can be radiating pain from the wisdom tooth area. The pain in the wisdom tooth site seems to be due to inflammation of the gum flap around wisdom tooth secondary to infection due to food accumulation between the gum flap and the tooth whereas it can also be due to infection in the wisdom tooth. It needs to be evaluated by a dentist and a clinical evaluation and x ray can help in diagnosis and treatment can be planned accordingly. Secondly the ulcers on the tongue seems to be apthous ulcers or canker sores and can be due to a number of causes like Deficiency of iron and vitamin B12, stress, acid reflux, physical injury with some sharp teeth etc. I would suggest you to take Vitamin B complex for ulcers..Do warm saline gargles. Apply numbing gel containing Lignocaine for relieving the pain. Suck ice pops..For pain in wisdom tooth anti-inflammatory painkiller like Advil or Aleve can be taken. Hope this  helps.

From last 1 month I’m suffering from jaundice with no nausea or vomiting and only minor itching. Skin colour and eyes colour is yellow. Supportive drugs are given. But no result is seen. Please guide me what should i do.","Doctor":"Hello,Thanks for your query on HCM\\"As\\"per your clinical history is concerned it will take up to 6 months to completely recover from hepatitis A, so please follow like this -1)Do take rest if you feel tired and sick and have less energy.2)Nausea can make it difficult to eat. Try snacking throughout the day rather than eating full meals. To get enough calories, eat more high-calorie foods. For instance, drink fruit juice or milk rather than water.3)Rest your liver. Your liver may have difficulty processing medications and alcohol. Review your medications, including over-the-counter drugs, with your doctor. Don't drink alcohol while infected with hepatitis. Do take all medications as per your Doctor's advice.Discuss with your treating Doctor about vaccination to all family members.Hope that helps"},{"Patient":"I just recently had a really bad uti and possible kidney stones the i passed on my own at home. It has been 2 weeks gone and now it back again. I did the at home uit test and it came back leukocytes positive and nitrite negative butvis really painful again. What can be the cause??","Doctor":"Hello! Welcome to HealthcareMagic! I understand your concern. Some of the causes of UTI can be: 1) E.Coli from gastrointestinal tract. 2) Sexual intercourse. 3) Women may be especially prone to UTIs because they have shorter urethras, which allow bacteria quick access to the bladder.Some advice that I can give you are: 1) Try cranberries. Cranberries may contain an ingredient that stops bacteria from attaching to the walls of the urinary tract. 2) Drink plenty of water. 3) Urinate when you need to. 4) Take prescribed antibiotics. Hope that clarifies your concerns. Thank you for the query. Take care Regards, Dr. Dorina Gurabardhi, General & Family Physician"},{"Patient":"Hi! I have a herpes type 2 and i had bareback sex with my boyfriend, he is undetectable hıv+. I used antiseptic liquid soap after sex. The Question is, Can antiseptic soap help to reduce herpes? and also do we need to use antiseptic soap after sex all the time. Can it prevent me from transmission of any sexual disease? Thank you","Doctor":"Hello! Welcome to HealthcareMagic! I understand your concern. Herpes is transmitted through direct contact between the contagious area and broken skin (a cut or break) and mucous membrane tissue (such as the mouth or genitals). Herpes can also be transmitted when there are no symptoms present. So I think that even with antibacterial soap there is a highly chance to be infected if you don't use condoms during intercourse. Hope my answer was helpful.If you have any other question Ill be glad to help. Thank you for the query.

I first got one bump on my vagina lips Friday and now have about 7 or 8 that are extremely painful and whenever pee comes in contact with them it’s extremely painful...... the bumps are red and some look like there open.....","Doctor":"Hello and welcome to HealthcareMagic! The classical sign and symptoms of herpes are painful vesicles. Vesicles are tiny rashes containing a transparent fluid. They usually start small and then increase in number. This seems like what you are describing. If this is so, I will advise you to see a doctor immediately. Firstly, you need to test for other sexually transmissible infections like hepatitis B, syphilis, HIV and chlamydia. Secondly, you need to start treatment with the antiviral Acyclovir and a strong analgesic (Tramadol). It is important to start a corticosteroid (Prednisolone) to prevent postherpetic neuralgia and an antibiotics therapy (Amoxicillin) to prevent infections in case you have an ulcer. Hope that clarifies you concern. Thank you for the query. Take care Regards, Dr. Chobufo Ditah, General & Family Physician"},{"Patient":"When my son visited a couple of weekends ago, I was shocked to see that over two thirds of his upper back was covered by what appears to be a large solid scab, or some kind of fungal growth. when I appeared shocked and questioned him, he seemed embarrassed (of course I am his mother) and dismissed it as nothing. He is Sixty two and grossly overweight, but always very clean and well groomed.","Doctor":"Hello! Welcome to HealthcareMagic! I have gone through your question and understand your concern. The cause of scab is unclear with no medical history (like if the patient is diabetic or hypertensive or currently on any medications or history of family allergies etc). However, a few causes considering the age and obesity can be enlisted.The most common on the list is fungal infection which you already suspect.Fungal infection can cause intense itch which eventually cause scab formation and may also  leave a hyperpigmented patch over the area. Fungal infections are not due to unhygienic personal habit in most cases. In obese it could be the underlying diabetes, low immunity, excess sweating or even frequent use of antibiotics to treat other infections.It could even be a scab from healed decubitus ulcer. Decubitus ulcers appear to be more prevalent in obese patients who spend above average time on their backs. Wound healing is also slow in obese patients and even boils over the skin tend to stay infected for a long period of time with slow healing rate. Psoriasis also occurs more frequently in obese, but the reasons for this are unclear.These are only few causes, they are plenty others. Obesity and skin infections can cause low self esteem and depression which will prevent the patient from seeking any medical help. My advice is to address the issue to a GP as the scab have to examined to come to a diagnosis(like Wood's Lamp examination or biopsy or scrapping of the scab). At your visit expect a few basic test like blood sugars, ESR, thyroid levels and physical examination before concluding the underlying cause after which treatment will be initiated.  Hope this clarifies you concern. Thank you for the query.

This is very common especially in cases you mention but elderly age is a reason also.It is generally self limiting but very uncomfortable meanwhile. There is oral acyclovir he might use to speed up healing, it should  be started as soon as possible and there are drugs for pain like ibuprofen and paracetamol.

A week ago I went in for a few ingrown hairs in my left arm pit and one in my lower abdomen.  The largest on in my left arm pit was opened, drained, cleaned, and packed.On Thursday evening, I was given a prescription for Bactrim and told to take 1 pill 2 times a day.I went in again on Saturday for the packing to be removed and 2 was told it looked like it was doing well.  I was told the intentional lab results indicated it was Staph, but it would be cultured in the lab..Sunday evening the bump on my abdomen, which had been puffy and a bit red, started oozing and got pretty bloody.  There was also a dark pinkish oval on my skin around it.So I went to the only urgent care clinic open on Labor Day in our small town.  The PA I saw lanced it, cleaned, it and packed it.  He was concerned and thought it looked more like MRSA and was surprised this had happened as I had been taking Bactrim for 4 days.  So he recommended I start taking 2 pills, 2 times a day.  I went back on Wednesday to have the packing replaced.  Today I noticed the pink/red oval on my skin around the abscess on my lower abdomen.  Does this mean the Bactrim is not working.  What do we do then?  I go back to the clinic tomorrow to have the packing on this one changed.Thanks!

Tuberculosis is a wide disease which can attack the lymph nodes, the lungs, intestine genitals etc. My first question on you is how it has been diagnosed? There are indirect tests of blood and direct tests like biopsy of the nodes. Tuberculosis is caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis.

It means it needs a long term therapy for 6 months.Initial 2 months: isoniazid + rifampicin + pyrazinamide + ethambutol Continuing 4 months with isoniazid + rifampicin During the tuberculostatic therapy regular checks of blood count, uric acid, renal retention parameters and liver values must be made!Because of the side effects of the medication ORL and Ophthalmologist controls are needed as well.I wish you good health."},{"Patient":"I m 53 years old, female.

I went to the local pharmacy and was given some antibiotic drops which seemed to help. A few weeks later I took my grandchildren swimming in the UK and quite promptly developed another outer ear infection. I still had the drops left from my holiday, so used them. Symptoms improved again. A few weeks after that, I went to a local swimming pool and I develop my third infection. All of the infections have been in my left ear. Prior to July 2017, I did not have a history of ear infections. I went to the GP and was given Otomize. I tried this for a week, but it became evident that the middle ear had become infected. I was experiencing dizziness and was unable to walk heel to toe! I went back to the GP and was prescribed amoxicillin for 5 days. After this course, I returned to the GP with symptoms improved, but not better. The GP prescribed erythromycin for 7 days. I have just finished a 7 day course of erythromycin. Unfortunately, I am still experiencing symptoms. Eg. the left side of my face is aching all down one side, their seems to be a pressure around the brow of my head, I have twinges of pain sporadically inside my left ear, tender left gland in my throat, pain going down the left side of my neck, slightly dizzy. I have just spoken to the duty DR today. She has told me that I will just have to ride out the problems. My own GP had said that if things did not improve, then she would refer me to the ENT Dept.

Test shows a slight elevation in something that meant my body was fighting something. That night immediately after taking small dose of non thc cdb oil (which i do not usually take. i just did it because i was trying to treat what was going on) I got extreme vertigo! 3 days ago A different Dr. determined it was my atlas and not my inner ear associated with the vertigo. He did craniosacral and it helped slightly. I was bed ridden the entire day. 2 days ago still bed ridden with the same symptoms. I got acupuncture and Chinese herbs which helped remedy the vertigo. I was mostly bed ridden that day.

I have now been also diagnosed with scleroderma. Wondering if there is some sort of medical info in print that might help me better understand just what part of my symptoms are anti synthetase and what are scleroderma based. Initially the diagnosis was polymyositis and seemed to escalate from there. I trust my doctors but also wondering about 2nd opinions","Doctor":"Hello,I understand your concern because it is a little bit difficult to understand exactly from which diagnose some symptoms come. Well at first to know, it is that they both are autoimmune disease, that means that your body attacks his cells ( create antibody anti some specific cell in the organism). And the diagnose it is confirm from these antibodies, in this case they are called autoantibodies. Antisynthetase has antibody anti Aminoacyl-tRNA synthase ( a enzyme), and sclerodermia, depending of what kind of, has different antibodies. Both of these disease have some symptoms that can overlapping, or the same, because they both touch lungs and fingers like Reynaud phenomen. But just to remember, sclerodermia attacks the skin first ( so symptoms which are correlated with skin as : redness, swelling, tenderness, itching are due to this) and another thing to remember in sklerodermia it is that usually touch the skin of face, neck fingers and foot. Symptoms that are more specific for antisynthtase they are correlate with muscles( weakness)  but also you can have arthritis. As they both are autoimmune disease, both of them cause fatigues and weight loss.

Even though they belong to herpes family, they are differentGlandular fever is common in teenagers and spreads by kissing, coughing.

If you still have lesions oral or genital kindly consult a doctor for a course of antiviral medication acyclovir.

Antibiotics are prescribed to treat syphilis because the causative agent is a bacterium. A single dose of penicillin G is the first option of treatment for early infections.In the case of late infections, intravenous injections of penicillin have to be given for at least 10 days.However, the tertiary stage of syphilis can be very difficult to treat since the bacteria has already invaded most of the vital sites in the body.So far as your case is concerned,I am sure that your syphilis has completely been cured as you have already been treated with penicillin shots.I hope this answer will give you good night's sleep and please do not be confused.Please feel free to wright to me if there is still any confusion.Thanks,Dr.Prabhas Verma"},{"Patient":"Hello Dr !

It is reassuring knowing you were bitten by your own dog as opposed to a feral dog because wild dogs carry much more bacteria and even rabies.

Bactrim is a medicine that is used in various animal bites but it is not the first choice based on the types of bacteria generally contained in dog bites.  However, if you are to use it, you need to get a full dosage and not just whatever is left over from a previous infection."},{"Patient":"My daughter was diagnosed with strep 3 days ago and has been on meds.

Is this the same thing or similar to Shingles?","Doctor":"Hello,Shingles is most definitely not the same thing as Stenotrophomonas Maltophilia.Shingles is a skin eruption that is actually caused by the varicella-zoster virus. Stenotrophomonas Maltophilia is a bacterial infection caused by the gram negative bacteria Stenotrophomonas Maltophilia.

They become pus-filled, then form scabs by about 10-12 days. In a few cases, only the pain is present without the rash or blisters.I hope you'll have a fair idea about the signs and symptoms of Shingles.I'd like to add that it is always better to see a doctor especially for skin conditions.Please feel free ask a follow up question.Thanks,Dr.Prabhas Verma"},{"Patient":"I have a friend with these symptoms. they happened suddenly about 14 hours ago: fever, bruising all over her body, vomiting water and diarrhea with water coming out.

In my opinion he should inform the duty staff, they will evaluate the symptoms and will call the doctor if required.These symptoms might be benign and part of his illness. But chest pain and shortness of breath can be due to pulmonary embolism. Pulmonary embolism means blockage of blood vessels of lungs due to clots. It causes chest pain and shortness of breath along with other symptoms. Patients who are ill and bed bound are at increased risk of it. It is a life threatening disease, so it should be ruled out.Hope, my answer was helpful. Regards."},{"Patient":"Hi, I m suffering from a virus of some sort per my doctor.

I have this fungal infection near my groin region which is been there for a long time now. I have been to skin docs they prescribed me some cream tabs nd a soap..

Carry an alcohol-based hand sanitizer for times when water isn't available.2)Avoid drinking untreated water. Contaminated drinking water is a particular problem in areas where typhoid is endemic. For that reason, drink only bottled water. Carbonated bottled water is safer than uncarbonated bottled water is. Wipe the outside of all bottles and cans before you open them. Ask for drinks without ice. Use bottled water to brush your teeth, and try not to swallow water in the shower.3)Try to avoid raw fruits and vegetables. Because raw fruits may have been washed in unsafe water, so try to avoid fruits and vegetables that you can't peel.4)Choose hot foods. Avoid food that's stored or served at room temperature. Steaming hot foods are best. Try to avoid food from street vendors because it's more likely to be contaminated.Hope that helps and wish you a quick recovery soon"},{"Patient":"I had a ureteroscopy over a week ago and had a stent in for 4 days.

This makes it possible that other bacteria can infect your eye, and replace MRSA, or fill the gap left after MRSA's eradication.Regarding the presence of MRSA in your body, I would say that it is hard to speak 100% for sure, but if you don't have any complaint, than you don't have MRSA.

So as you have commenced from after hospital so definitely it emanates from your appendix area. Apply a protective cream or ointments.

It is in constant contact with the ground from which it can pick up millions of bacteria, one of them being MRSA. Note that I said ONE in a million could be MRSA.  You have a sore in the toe mostly due to repeated trauma or single bruise on the foot and have ignored the injury or you have a foot ulcer secondary to diabetes. There are multiple causes for an ulcer/sore.  But since you complain only of pain and no swelling or pus I do not think it has reached the stage of infection. MRSA is not your worry now.

The surgeries were done three weeks apart, with the second one he admitted me to hospital. The day after the second surgery I was inserted with a PICC line for the staph infection and immediately had the feeling I was smothering/drowning; and still do to this day. I ve lost 30 pounds since the PICC line was put in, am weak, short of breath and so tired all the time. My foot still swells if I am on it for any length of time.

I have thoroughly read your query and understand your concerns. For the MRSA infection, if it is getting better with the antibiotics he is taking then there is no need to change the treatment plan. But if it is not responding to the medications, then I would suggest that you talk to his treating physician who may do a test to check for the sensitivity and give appropriate antibiotic. Being bedridden and immobile can lead to swollen ankles and feet and this is a common problem amongst patients admitted to hospital ward. However, if I come across a patient with such a problem, I would thoroughly examine his lower limbs (including veins for any blockage) and review other body systems. I would also run few important basic tests to look for any kidney, heart or liver problems. I don’t want to unnecessarily alarm you but it is always good to be on the safe side. Hope this helps. And please feel free to ask for any further clarification."},{"Patient":"hi , my name is Pamela & I got my belly piercing about a month ago . my belly piercing grew a keloid and i started putting garlic and olive oil to cure it. when the keloid got smaller , I decided to put a little more but then it cut me a little. i then put aspirin on it and now i got an allergic reaction. the top hole of my belly piercing is extremely red and bumpy and i don't know what to do to cure it. how can i cure it and how long will take for this to go away?","Doctor":"Hi..Thanks for the query..Allergic reaction to aspirin at the site of allergic reaction is due to inflammation caused at the site of reaction..The allergic reaction can be treated by taking antihistamines like Claritin or benadryl or allegra twice daily for 3 days..Keep the area of the piercing clean and apply steroid based ointment on it in order to reduce inflammation and bump..In case of pain you can take anti-inflammatory painkiller like Ibuprofen or Advil..You can apply numbing gel containing lignocaine or choline salicylate over the inflammed area for relief from pain..Do not remove or change the jewellery you are wearing over the belly piercing till the area heals and becomes painless..Do cold compresses not directly by placing ice but wrapping ice in a clean and dry cotton cloth and putting it over inflammed area..In case you find discharge or pus formation which are signs of infection you need to take antibiotics like augmentin or clindamycin for 5 days and apply antiseptic ointment over the area..Hope this  helps..Regards.."},{"Patient":"Hello Doctor My father aged 67 years recently had CABG on Jan 21 2014.

Your previous CAG was in 2009 and almost 10 years have passed since then. What is your resting ECG now?

Little blood almost negligible came out..but after some time i realised it might be pin or a needle too. So was worried should I go for HIV 4th generation test after 28 days?","Doctor":"Hi. Transmission of HIV in such a manner is highly unlikely. Usually transmission of HIV occurs when blood/secretions of an infected person having this virus enters in the body of an un-infected person. This can happen during sex, during blood transfusion and prick by infected needles. In your case scenario for infection to occur that sex worker must be HIV positive, there should be virus in blood of that sex worker and the object which pricked you should be soiled with blood/internal secretions having virus and then that prick should have occurred in such a way to deliver virus to your blood vessels. All of these events are highly unlikely.So, there is no big reason to worry as there is only a theoretical possibility of transmission not likely to be real. I would be glad to answer any further queries you may have in future. Regards."},{"Patient":"My cartilage piercing has been hurting and sore for the past few weeks.

As per your query you have symptoms of inner ear infection which could be due to accumulation of wax and infection in ear. Sometimes fluid accumulation behind the eardrum may reduced hearing tendency. I would suggest you to consult an Otolaryngologist and get evaluated. You should maintain proper hygiene. Put otogesic ear drops in ear. For infection in ear oral antibiotics as well as antibiotic ear drops and decongestant nasal sprays can help. Apply warm compresses to external ear. You should get it checked and go for otoscopic examination as it is important. You can go for drainage of fluids as well.Hope your concern has been resolved.Get Well Soon.Best Wishes,Dr. Harry Maheshwari"},{"Patient":"I WENT TO MY DR.

The first dose was given to me in the ER because I am allergic to other antibiotics. I had no problems with first dose but I was also on tramadol, bentyl, and zofran. This morning I took the macrobid after a large breakfast with a full glass of water. 5 minutes later I felt an intense adrenaline rush and had to get up and walk around. My throats felt a little full and sore. 40 minutes later my vision got blurry and I felt like I was having the worse panic attack of my life, I was trembling. I felt short of breath. I took a Benadryl just in case. I don t have any symptoms anymore. I m wondering if I was having an adverse or allergic reaction, but I don t know why I didn t have one with my first dose. I am also on doxycycline for Lyme but hadn t taken it yet. It was a very scary feeling but I also don t want a kidney infection, and I need something I can take along with my doxy. My heart palpitations I sometimes get are a little aggravated now.","Doctor":"HI, thanks for using healthcare magicIt is understandable , since you are allergic to other antibiotics, to be concerned that you may also be allergic to the macrobid.Swelling of the throat, change in vision and shortness of breath would normally occur with a severe allergic reaction that would require a lot of medication. These types of reactions do not usually respond to antihistamines only.This means that it is not likely an allergic reaction.It is possible to have allergy tests done for medication. You may want to consider asking your doctor to be assessed for different meds so that you can be certain.I hope this helps"},{"Patient":"The last 10 days I been fighting poison ivy.

The sore throat and nose congestion along with the aches and pains points out to a viral organism causing the symptoms. Rashes are also part of a classical viral origin flu. Since you don't have fever you need not worry much. Viral infections usually gets resolved on its own. Use warm salt water gargle to help with the sore throat and steam inhalation will help with the congestion. Most probably the cough is due to the flow of your nasal secretions towards your throat. As for the stomach cramps it might be due to the intake of antibiotics resulting in gastritis. Symptomatic relief can also be provided by certain anti histamines.

The strange part is that it actually itched when I went.  It still itches.  Is it possible to get a yeast infection from the antibiotics in your bottom?","Doctor":"Hi,Thank you for the question. There is nothing embarrassing in discussing a health related issue. Your history suggests that you've used antibiotics for a long period of time. This in itself alters the normal microbes that exist in our bowels and on our skin. Due to changes in these normal helpful microbes it is very much possible that harmful organisms make your body their home. You may be suffering from a fungal/yeast infection called candida which is causing the itch. I suggest you visit your physician and confirm the problem.

Thrombocytopenia is a common problem in cardiovascular patients, particularly those who are in critical care units.Thrombocytopenia is a condition characterized by abnormally low levels of thrombocytes. Patients with thrombocytopenia had more episodes of major bleeding, increased incidence of acute kidney injury, and infection like staph infection.Atherosclerosis, aortic stenosis, or other vascular pathologies that predispose to heightened platelet consumption.

I m now at a stage where while the rash is fading, an accompanying itch/pain is intense and driving me mad. A week ago, when itch/pain were low, I asked my doctor what I could do for pain, and she suggested I might try Capsaicin. I haven t bought it yet, and am trying to understand how it works. -- Livi","Doctor":"Kind regards! You are experiencing neuralgic pain,which is classified as one of the worst! Capsaicin allegedly \`\`drains\`\` and impairs the resynthesis of the notorious substance P in peripheral nerve endings. Substance P is in many studies since it is thought to be important neurotransmiter in many chronic conditions and processess (pain,inflamation............). But what it boils down to is this :  You will be using Capsaicin locally (topical), a substance quite natural with very little chance of systemic side effects,which could very likely alleviate your trouble. When You put that on one side of the scale, and when You see what is offered to You on the other side (analgetics,tricyclic antidepressants,tranquilizers,carbapine,antiepileptics......all used systemicaly,intravenous,intramuscular,as tablets and pills) with many,many side effects,interactions and potential hazards and with no guaranteed success...................Of course,postherpetic neuralgia can last for quite some time,and maybe you will reach for some of these drugs anyhow,but Capsaicin is definitely a most benign first step and a definite \`\`lesser evil\`\`.

As per your query you have symptoms of sinus infections with dizziness and ear pain which are symptoms of chronic sinusitis and could be due to eustachian tube dysfunction. Need not to worry.

Montelukast is also effective for this. You should take steam inhalation. Visit ENT specialist once and get it examined. You should go for sinus X ray and CT scan done as well.

I have been to 4 doctors and they say it s a parasite but all of them are stumped. I tried to get a jump on this rash but now it has advanced so much that it s on my entire body. Along with being very itchy, I can see tiny white specs, which I think are either eggs or the organism, all over my body. I see the most activity in the morning and at night on my lower legs (calves & feet), on my arms from elbow to hands, and on my head. My scalp is extremely itchy and I m picking off these white objects that are coming out of my pores. I thought it was just big pimples at first but they aren t. I m 32 and know that there is something infecting these pimple looking spots on my face and scalp. I have also found that almost every single hair of my face has something on them. The hair is either infected or this parasite is attaching itself to them somehow. I thought it was ingrown hairs and tried pulling them out. That s when I found out. These white, almost clear, organisms are in my mouth and my eyes now. I see them on my eye lashes. When I m able to, I ll pull off the ones I can feel moving from my legs, arms, and especially my face. Over the past 5 weeks, I ve taken benedryl for the itch but it hasn t helped. Also, scabies cream(5 weeks ago), pinworm pill and again 7 days later(4 weeks ago), parasite pill 7 days ago with a refill I m getting tomorrow(last week), and just bought a pinworm liquid from CVS 2 days ago to try again. These whitish objects are coming off in different lengths. I can t tell if it s a worm or a mite. And my dermatologist doctor told me that it s not scabies. I ve gone through everything trying to kill whatever this is. I treated it as fleas in the beginning, then bedbugs, then lice. It has started to leave sores on my wrists and face and I can see something under my skin but don t want to pick at it from fear of causing more damage than good. I ve also lost 25 lbs even though I eat like crazy in an attempt to counter the effects if it is an internal parasite. Please, any direction or input as to what this might be so I can finally kill this thing would be extremely helpful.

I am a machinist and a few months ago I had an incident. I think I broke off a tiny tiny cutting tool, a piece of tungsten(we call carbide) end mill possibly just below my skin on my hand. We are talking only about .015 diameter and maybe .187 long. I could see a dark mark below my skin. This endmill is used to cut carbon so I thought it could have more or less stabbed me pulled out and the carbon dust that would be on the flutes of the endmill was left it my skin. It didn t turn red, no infection or anything, or discomfort. I finally did a little self surgery yesterday and took a razor and dug out whatever was left, dust, perhaps tiny bit of the broken off tool. So my question is, with that tiny bit of tungsten just below the skin, is tungsten toxic in that form, a solid, NOT dust, which I know IS toxic?","Doctor":"DearAny foreign body in the body ,if so tiny  our body has its own mechanism to throw it out by possibly building a corn or infection and burst out.So far metal toxicity is concerned,it has a little  harm in your case.But I am afraid of the self surgery which has been done as it may lead to a greater amount of infection instead.Please get it examined by a surgeon and removal if possible.Take carehope this helpsmost welcome for further queries"},{"Patient":"My friend is 66.

It's a chronic skin condition caused by an allergic reaction to variable triggers such as climate, food, physical, chemical, emotional factors. Main sign is itching leading to thickened leathery skin (lichenification). Lesion are dry and scaly, affects mostly flexural areas (back of the knee, etc) in children but any part of the body may get involved.  Patients with atopic dermatitis usually have other types of allergic conditions. Her tummy grass irritation was possibly contact dermatitis which responded to Benadril (antihistamin). Atopic dermatitis is treated with skin moisturizers (dry skin worsens the condition). Patients should avoid frequent bathing, using washcloths or brush during bathing. Also, should avoid known allergens. Cool compress and antihistamins used to control itchiness.  I is advised to wear loose fitting cotton clothes. In severe disease topical or systemic corticosteroids  may be prescribed. Patients with atopic dermatitis are increased risk of secondary skin infections.

Been tested for stds and everything came back negative. Thought it was my ph balance so I used the vaginal gel and now taking the pills. Symptoms still are happening. I think the cause of the wet panties is from slowing leaking urine. Do you think you can help me out ?","Doctor":"Dear patient,If you think the wet panties have a urinary tract origin instead of vaginal mucus, than I would recommend you to visit a Urologist. There are different types of urinary incontinence, which a specialist will be able to determine the right one after a thorough medical examination. It can be a:- Neurogenic bladder. Small amounts of urine loss both day and night. It can be treated with drugs such as Betanechol, which help you contract and empty your bladder.- Fistula. Continuos loss of urine day and night. Treated with surgery. And then there are some conditions which I don't think apply to your case such as Hypertonic bladder.Regarding the discoloration, if stds are not the cause, I would like to know more about your menstrual cycle. Often, what we call estrogenic cycles are the cause of irregular menstruation associated by intermittent uterine bleeding that end up as spots in your underwear. In this case, progesterone contraceptives are the recommended treatment. In case of a desired pregnancy, please consult a ob/gyn. You will need to stabilize your cycle or help the ovulation, and the spotting will disappear during pregnancy.I hope I have helped you dear!Wish you health,Manoku Eni, M.D."},{"Patient":"I and my wife are going through difficult situation. We have been leaving together for 8 years now and i have got tested positive to chlamydia and my wife negative. Since we are together I swear to God that I have cheated on her but she does not believe me . Now we are getting closer to a separation or divorce . can you please me to know on how could I get tested positive and not my wife while we even have two child ?","Doctor":"Dear patient,From what I have read, I understand that you are going through a very difficult situation which needs to be handled with caution. You swear to God that you have NOT cheated on her, but she does not believe you.Now, chlamydia is a bug that in many cases in male patients is associated with an asymptomatic infection. This means that you may have gotten the infection by a prior sexual relationship, 8 years ago, and the infection has been 'asleep' and has not shown any symptom. This happens in about 80-90% of infected male patients. The other issue is the negativity of your wife toward the bug. If you have had the infection for so long, than she may think why hasn't she encountered the bug and gotten infected as well. I can only assume that the infection was so weak that it didn't show symptoms for 8 years and it could not be spread to your wife. This is the only possible explanation, and this can happen.Please try to calm your wife, and show your steadfast love and your desire to stay together.I hope my answer helps,Manoku Eni, M.D."},{"Patient":"hey, I ve had this pain in my vagina for a long time, on and off. my symptoms include; itching, burning, sometimes slimy discharge, yellow discharge and yeast like discharge. I m not sexually active, in fact it I ve never had sex. I m not sure but I think it started when i washed my vagina with soap. could you please give me some advise on what it might be and what to do. thankyou","Doctor":"Dear lady,What you describe is a common yeast infection of the vagina. The skin inside your vagina is usually covered by a layer of healthy bacteria, which produce an acidic mucus that protects from yeasts and other sort of infections like 'bad' bacteria. This is why you shouldn't use soap to wash your vagina, because soap can kill the healthy bacteria, and help the yeast infection to stabilize and produce the aforementioned symptoms.If you were my patient, I would recommend using Miconazole 1200 mg suppository inserted in your vagina. It is used only once and it will get rid of the yeast infection. But if you want someone close to follow you, please visit a local doctor.I would also recommend you to now use soap again to wash your vagina, running water is more than enough.I hope I have helped you understand your condition better.

Glucocorticoids and immunosuppressive agents are effective in some patients during the acute phase but have the risk of side effects as you have experienced with prednisolone... Surgical bypass or endovascular intervention of a critically stenotic artery may be necessary. What you are having is some large artery occlusion in the upper limb, causing ischemic/claudication pain on active movement of the limb. Angiography is needed to delineate focal or segmental changes/occlusion in large arteries in the upper extremities. Synthetic or autogenous bypass grafts need to be placed onto disease-free segments of vessels. For focal lesions, there have been reports of success with angioplasty and may provide relief.

Anyway you have not mentioned about urinary symptoms like burning sensation while urination or increased frequency. since you have mentioned about cloudy dark urine, it is better to get a urine full report , full blood count and CRP done. sometimes when you are at advanced age you don't show fever, you just get constitutional symptoms.    if the count show a viral one you have a flu. any way these joint pains and body pains are more of viral flu's symptoms.

She had gotten the HPV shot at age 11yr'old and shortly after she started her menstrual cycle. She then stopr having normal cycles. After all these years she still gets this really bad discharge in the vaginal area.  She has never been sexually active the color of it is yellow and sometimes brown. she still does not have periods every month like she should. Took her to doctors before and they said they didn't know what it was. And only gave her An anitbiodic. which didnt help. She had only had that one shot, what can be causing this? Thank you","Doctor":"Good morning,I understand your concerns about your daughter s health.1- HPV infection does not cause the symptoms you are describing and it is a sexually transmitted infection. since your daughter is not sexually active and al so by history the symptoms are not suggestive of such an infection, it is unlikely that you daughter has an HPV infection. it is recommended that your daughter to take the full course of HPV vaccination to decrease the risk of cervical cancer later on in life.2- regarding the irregular cycles, at this age it is well known that the hypothalamic pituitary ovarian axis is not mature enough so it is very common among girls of her age to have irregular cycles. with time these cycles will become regular. 3- regarding the vaginal discharge, more information is needed, such as the presence of itching, the smell, the consistency of the discharge. If the discharge is more white thick with itching this might be due to candidiasis and the treatment will be diflucan 150 mg orally one tablet once with miconazole cream on the genital area. Foul smelling and greyish discharge is more due to bacterial vaginosis and can be treated with metronidazole (flagyl). Green foul smelling discharge can be due to the presence of a foreign body in the vagina and should be removed. Considering that your daughter is not sexually active.Best regards"},{"Patient":"I got bit by a dog a week ago and got my lip stitched up. I got 2 on the inside of the wound which are dissolvable.

I cry about this every day because before he was ok with it and we were careful and then all of a sudden he just wants to be friends. Do he have it or not?","Doctor":"Dear patient,I totally understand your frustration and how this is affecting your personal life.Regarding HSV 1 and/or 2 infection the following points should be taken into consideration in order to understand the situation better.1- In case someone got infected by HSV 1 and or 2 then the virus will be always present in the body but wouldnt cause a reccurence unless there are certain circumstances like stress, sun exposure, other infection, immunosupression ... So if your partner has been exposed to the virus meaning he has the virus but the virus is not replicating (sleeping mode).2- Reccurence means that the virus that was sleeping is now replicating and this will cause symptoms (vesicular lesions with an erythematous base : blisters with redness of the skin) and pain. Any patient who has been previously exposed to the virus can have a reccurence.3- The way to know if someone has been exposed to the virus is by doing IgG and IgM against HSV 1 and 2. if they are positive it means that this person has the virus. However to detect if certain genital or oral lesions are due to HSV (meaning reccurence) then a testing of the blisters (tzank smear and culture) or a PCR from a swab from these blisters can give you the answer.4- there is no cure for HSV, however in case of reccurence the treatment will be acyclovir 400 mg three times daily for 10 days.I recommend that both of you to do the labs mentionned above and hence know your status before taking rapid decisions.Best regards"},{"Patient":"i have just started using ventilin several times a day as I was getting a bit breathless  I am now getting very cold and starting to shake I have taken Advil  and after about an hour or so break out in huge sweats for about an hour  It has been happening couple of times thru the day and night also feel a bit lethargic for the last four days.

Me and one of my friend are taking care of some street dogs in our colony. Two months back three puppies died suddenly within two days, probably because of dummy rabies. We were feeding them and taking care of them at that time. Though they had not bitten us ever, for the precautionary measure, we took 3 shots of anti-rabbies vaccine (Rabipur) at that time in May, 2017. Now in july, another 3 puppies came and one of which bitten by an unknown dog and is now suffering with symptoms of rabies. We had also vaccinated that puppy 3 doses before two weeks. But unfortunately, the symptoms of rabies appeared again in that puppy. Yesterday, we also injected that puppy the fourth dose (14th day). But she was suffering badly with symptoms of rabies and was crying since last 2 days. Today, we gave her an injection for mercy killing and disposed out that puppy by packing it in bio-hazard safety poly bag. Sir, my question is: Though me and my friend were taking care of that puppy, should we take the antirabbies vaccine again? None of the dogs have bitten us and we are already vaccinated (3 shots of Rabipur) two months back. We were in confusion that if that puppy s saliva would have come in contact with any of our body parts, are we at risk? Both of us don t have any remarkable wounds in our body and we usually clean our hands with dettol/savlon each time we handle them. Kindly guide me.

Also the use of creams containing aloa vera might help the skin to become healthier and resistant to trauma.Best regards"},{"Patient":"My fiancee is a 44yr old male--just had a valve replacement last Friday...he has been VERY bloated and in extreme pain ever since the surgery.

Could not relate allergy to any one food or drink and reactions are not always the same.

The most common is on the flank but it can occur in other places. Full body rash is not common and usually only occurs in people that have immune deficiencies. The edema is concerning and may mean something severe is going on with the heart or kidneys. He needs to see a doctor as soon as possible for blood tests and an exam.

Sometimes the blood is apparent on the toilet paper only. Your primary care doctor or a gastroenterologist will help you with the required investigation. Regarding the other issues, MRSA can be difficult to eradicate and you'd better talk with an infectious diseases specialist. Antibiotics by mouth are not usually enough and repeated use may result in the development of resistant pathogens.

Here immune system is overactive.In our body, we have our immune system which fights against any infection in the body exposed anytime. But in lupus affected patient the immune system gets disturbed where the body's immune system does not recognize the foreign body (infectious agent) and healthy tissue. So, it indirectly damages the healthy tissues of the body by autoantibodies causing inflammation, pain, and damage to organs.It is non-communicable, not even by sexual contact. Each year to 16,000 cases reported each year. In the US till now 1.5 million people are affected with lupus. People with age ranging from 15 to 44 years are more likely to develop the disease. Mostly, women develop lupus.Risk factors are excessive exposure to sunlight, UV light, exposure to Epstein-Barr virus infection.It is true that there is no specific cure to it, but the disease progression can be controlled with relieve to symptoms like fatigue, joint pain, rash, and fever, etc.Usually, doctor prescribes patients corticosteroids and immunosuppressant with lifestyle changes. If left untreated or poorly treated develops complications like anemia and blood clotting disorders. Also affecting lungs, kidneys, heart, and lastly brain and nervous system.So do not worry people with lupus live their full life, but with care and the advice followed properly with regular medications. So, follow all the advice your treating doctor has advised with medications.Hope I have answered your query.

I just took temp. And it is 99.9. Should I go to my doctor tomorrow? YYYY@YYYY","Doctor":"Hi dear. Welcome to HealthCareMagic. Thanks for trusting us. I have understood your questions. But before, may I know what kind of antibiotics do you use? How long have you consumed this drug? It's really helpful when I know surely the name of your drug so I can look for the possible cause of your condition.For urinary tract infection, the antibiotics which most given is from fluoroquinolone class such as ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin, levofloxacin etc. This kind of drug have several side effects especially in causing GI discomfort (abdominal pain, cramps, nausea or vomiting) like the symptoms you have. The others are dizziness, headache, fatigue, weakness etc.Another class of antibiotics usually used for UTI is cotrimoxazole (combination of trimethoprim - sulfamethoxazole). It also can cause nausea, vomiting and anorexia. Beside that, amoxicillin/clavulanic acid can be used for UTI and it minimally causes GI distress.The fever that you felt is called subfebris. If I were your treating doctor, you can take acetaminophen 500 mg for your fever. If any of your symptoms get worse, it's better to contact your local doctor.You should know that the goals of UTI treatment are eradication of infection, preventing​ complications and preventing recurrence. Take all the antibiotics like your doctor prescribed, because stopping it in the middle of treatment can cause resistence.For prevention of UTI you should drink plenty of water and drink cranberry juice. Some studies suggest cranberry can reduce recurrence of UTI. Keep your private area clean and dry.I hope this answer can resolve all your concerns. If there's anything else you need to know, feel free to ask me in HCM. I'd be glad to help you. Wish you get better soon. Take care.Regards,dr.

The affected area is usually swollen, red, warm to touch, and painful.This infection typically occurs after the skin is broken from localised injury to the skin, the bacteria penetrates the area and the infection spreads, it is more common if you are diabetic or if you have swollen legs from any other cause.If you are already on antibiotics, I advise that you visit your doctor as soon as possible as you may require a change of antibiotics, usually a penicillin based drug. If the infection is severe, you will require IV antibiotics.In the time being, clean the area thoroughly and keep it dry. You can apply a topical antiseptic such as mupirocin or silver sulfadiazine.Continue with the antibiotics until you see your doctor.Elevate your leg to reduce the swelling.Control your sugar levels if you are diabetic.Keep well."},{"Patient":"I have a serious pinworm infection.

The reason why the repeat dose is after two weeks is to prevent reinfection.

His right arm, just above the wrist area now has a silver dollar, deep purple hematoma, and it s bleeding.

This suggests a bleeding disorder. If he bleeds easily from his gums when brushing his teeth, it is also suggestive of a bleeding problem.The doctor will run a blood test to check his bleeding profile ie whether his blood has enough platelets to clot. Other blood tests might also be done based on the results.If the bruises are on the skin that was exposed to cleaning chemicals, he could be experiencing chemical burns or contact dermatitis. This is easily treated with topical antiseptic creams (silver sulfadiazine) for burns and anti histamine (allergex) with topical steroids for contact dermatitis.If this is the cause, he should wear gloves when cleaning so that he does not expose himself to the chemicals.If in doubt, and bruises are developing spontaneously anywhere on the body, I recommend visiting the doctor for the blood tests i mentioned above.Thank you.Keep well."},{"Patient":"Dear Dr.Vineet, This query is regards your old patient Mrs.Gayatree Panda ,59 years ,who was diagnosed with CA Ovary stage III in Apollo ,HYd.She underwent cytoreductive surgery at RGCI on 5.5.08.HPE showed residual disease present,ascetic fluid positive.She was NED till march 2009 when she had inguinal lymph node enlargement FNAC positive CA 125-195 u/ml.

You have navel infection. Most people see their doctor while the infectious process is still mild.In such instances, topical antibiotic ointments like Neosporin, Polysporin First Aid Antibiotic or Duospore, will be sufficient to kill the bacteria and resolve the issue.Doctors will also prescribe antibiotics alongside the topical treatment for more serious infections.The course of treatment will usually continue a couple of days.Surgery is required solely in extreme cases of belly button infections.This is why it’s imperative to seek medical assistance as soon as the first strange symptoms are experienced!Physicians may also recommend salt water rinses to destroy the bacteria.The rinse is made by dissolving a teaspoon of salt in warm water. Saline solutions are also available in most pharmacies.After the belly button has been rinsed, it should be dried thoroughly with a soft towel.People that have a piercing will need to remove it until the infection subsides.Discharge can be cleaned with hydrogen peroxide (a mild antiseptic) to keep the area dry and clean. Popular Home Remedies for Belly Button InfectionA couple of home remedies can be used for the effective management of belly button infections.The aim of most treatments is to kill the bacteria or control the candida overgrowth. 1. Tea Tree OilTea tree oil is one of the most popular natural treatments for infection in the belly button.Tea tree oil can be diluted in coconut oil and applied to the affected region several times per day. Don’t apply undiluted tea tree oil to the navel region2. Turmeric (Curcuma longa) PowderTurmeric is also known for its powerful antibacterial and antifungal properties.add a little bit of water to your turmeric powder and stir.You should get a thick paste. Apply to the inflamed region and let it dry. After the turmeric powder dries completely, clean the area gently and pat it dry.3. Neem (Indian lilac)Neem powders and creams are also available in cosmetic stores and online. Neem powder can be mixed with turmeric to deliver even better results.4. White VinegarYou will need to dilute one part of white vinegar in two parts of lukewarm water. Soak a cotton swab and apply to the belly button area.Let the compress act for 10 to 15 minutes, remove the cotton ball and dry the skin. The procedures can be repeated two to three times per day.5. Aloe Veraaloe vera juice has soothing properties. The beneficial plant is also known to kill harmful bacteria. For best results, you should use fresh aloe vera juice (obtained straight from the plant). Just cut a leaf open and apply the juicy part to the infected skin. Leave it on for a few minutes and clean the area. The aloe vera juice should reduce the inflammation and it will also provide almost immediate symptom relief.6. CalendulaMake some calendula tea, soak a cotton ball in the lukewarm liquid and apply to the belly button region. Keep the compress on for 10 to 15 minutes. Apply frequently, especially if you’re finding it difficult to cope with the infection symptoms.7. Coconut OilCoconut oil is a good energy source but also contains antifungal and antimicrobial ingredients. Coconut oil will also reduce the redness, pain and skin hotness linked to belly button infectionsHope i have answered your question. Feel free to contact me if you have any more questions.

Sometimes there might be no bleeding, so you need to make sure the skin is not broken.). As no skin was broken, you need not worry. Wash the scratch with an antiseptic and don't cover it. You might need a tetanus booster injection if the last shot was more than a year ago.I hope this information helps."},{"Patient":"Hi doc. My son was bitten by our dog last november. He is vaccinated by 5 dose of anti rabies. His last vaccination was just this year january. And he is bitten again yesterday. Do he really need to be vaccinated again? By the way, our dog is also vaccinated for anti rabies. Thanks","Doctor":"Hello Dear. To be on safer side i would advice you to get your son vaccinated again. But it depends on the severity of wound. If it is just minor abrasions then just 2 booster dose on 0 and 3rd day is enough. If the wound is severe or in sites like head, face, neck etc then the entire course should be repeated.Some doctors may suggest just a Tetanus injection, and ask you to watch the dog for ten days. If there is any signs of madness in the dog in the course of ten days then report immediately and get vaccinated. Otherwise just a tetanus is enough. This may be the view of some doctors in case you are very sure that the pet dog doesnot have symptoms of rabies and its vaccinated.But still there is a minor chance of risk. Why to take even the slightest risk? Because once if a person contracts rabies then mortality is 100%.Hence you can contact a physician and let him assess the severity of wound and in case it is a minor wound just ask your son to take 2 booster dose on 0 and 3rd day.Though the immunity lasts for 2 to 10 years but still it is advisible to take booster dose of rabies irrespective of the interval between the previous full course of vaccination, because we dont want to take risk with rabies.Hope i have answered your question.

Thank you in advance.","Doctor":"Hi,Thanks for your question on HCMI do understand your concernAs per your clinical history is concerned her problem is due to infection only so control dehydration at home if not possible admit at most proximate hospital for IV drips.you can discuss with her Doctor to integrate an antibiotics like [ciprofloxacin 30mg per kg per day maximum in two divided doses]. You can integrate a probiotic like lactobacillus syrup. Consummate antibiotic course for 7 days.You can do few things at home to prevent it in future -:1)wash hands frequently and thoroughly2)supervise small children when they wash their hands3)dispose of soiled diapers properly4)disinfect  diaper changing areas after use5)avoid swallowing water from ponds, lakes or untreated pools.6)Mash one ripe banana and add one teaspoon of tamarind pulp and a pinch of salt to it. Mix it well. Give this mixture twice daily to settle an upset digestive system.7)Rice is an excellent bland food recommended for diarrhea. It is high in starch and easy to digest. So, you can have plain boiled white rice but without any spices or sauces. Start by having small amounts of rice and gradually increase the amount as your condition improves. You can also add clear fluids and starchy liquids such as rice water, coconut water, fruit and vegetable juices, and clear broths etcHope that helps"},{"Patient":"Hi, may I answer your health queries right now ?

Nevertheless, I recommend you to closely monitor your blood pressure values frequently during the day in the next week and see if your blood pressure values are above the normal ranges most of the time. If such is the case, I would recommend consulting with your doctor for a physical activity and some blood lab tests (complete blood count, PCR, ESR, thyroid hormone levels, blood electrolytes, kidney and liver function tests, fasting glucose) and discuss with him on the possibility of starting anti-hypertensive therapy.

Urethral discharge culture and sensitivity. 3. Urine routine examination. Kindly consult Urologist with the report for appropriate clinical evaluation and further management. Also, it would be advisable to keep yourself well hydrated by consuming good quantity of fluids and increasing the intake of citrus fruits in your diet.

This is a neglected tropical disease that came from south or central America. Related forms also come from Africa. Mansonella ozzardi may be a co-infection. The combination of Ivermectin, albendazole and diethylcarbamazine in combination seem to be the most effective treatment in terms of reducing or eliminating the microfilaria in the blood, and possibly killing the adult worms that may occupy the serous cavities. The patient has had this for some time and has been ignored by doctors because these parasites are not common in North America. Her condition is worsening and it seems that trying to treat it has less risk than the pain and other symptoms that are acute at times. The WHO administers these drugs in widespread mass drug administration programs through community centers and aid workers, so access should be possible anywhere.

Glossitis usually responds well to treatment if the cause is identified and corrected with multivitamin tablets or Vitamin B complex tablets. For reducing the pain you could use glycerin.Iron-deficiency anemia is another cause of soreness and is mainly caused by blood loss, such as may occur during menses or gastrointestinal hemorrhage. Multivitamin tablets can help.Bacterial, viral or fungal infections can cause glossitis so if any infection with layer of white patch is found on the tongue that means the tongue is infected and should be treated with antibiotics. If it was oral candidiasis(white patch) common in asthma patients - Nystatin : swish and swallow should be done.Hope this answers your question.

Specific treatment will be given by your doctor after investigation reports, you can do few things at home to reduce body temperatures -1)Soak a wash cloth in cool tap water, wring out the excess water and then sponge areas like your armpits, feet, hands and groin to reduce the temperature. Also, you can place cold, damp washcloths on your forehead and the back of your neck. The cloth pieces should be changed regularly after a few minutes. This remedy is beneficial when dealing with a high fever as it helps keep temperature under control.2)Make a tea by mixing one teaspoon of basil with one-fourth teaspoon of pepper in one cup of boiling water. Steep for five minutes, and then strain and drink the tea. Drink it two or three times daily.Hope that helps"},{"Patient":"I go to A VA facility I ddd, mildhypertropic fact disease and a couple other things wrong with my back pain continues too get worse my father was exposed too agent orange in Vietnam.

I suggest that she has an infection. However, you have not mentioned details such as her age. I suggest that you need to see a doctor because she needs antibiotics that you cannot buy without a prescription. Meanwhile, you can help her by giving her a over the counter medicine like Avil or Fexofenadine or Montelukast. This will reduce the symptoms greatly. You can give her paracetamol syrup with ibuprofen. Please visit my virtual clinic at XXXX for more counselling. Thanks for using HCM."},{"Patient":"Hi Doctor,I had a spinal fusion in May 2017 but was readmitted with severe gastric symptoms which was put down to allergy to medication for pain. I have lost 13 kilos and have just had a breath test which came back positive. I have been burping and had flatus all these months. Could the infection have occurred because the gastro nasal tube or mask have been inadequately cleaned?( I used to work in theatre). Should my husband also have a breath test? I also have had candida which has been treated. Many thanks Jan Reid Sydney","Doctor":"Hi,After reviewing your question I assume you mean a positive breath test for H. pylori? I am sorry to hear the amount of discomfort that you've been through. This is how I would proceed to look at your case:1. Your symptoms are very peculiar for peptic ulcer disease or gastritis. Both are different ways of getting damage done to your stomach. An ulcer is like a crater which may or may not be prone to bleeding. Gastritis is a bit like having multiple pinpoint sore spots, causing pain and discomfort. A positive breath test may mean that you have H. pylori infection. As uncomfortable as this is, it is usually very treatable. Were you on many pain killers because of the spinal fusion? If yes, then they would certainly have contributed. 2. I don't think a mask has anything to do with this. A sterile nasogastric tube taken out of the bag is very unlikely to bring infection to the insides of the stomach. Nasogastric tubes, however, do cause a bit of irritation in the stomach lining. While they could have a very small contribution, I doubt they have had a significant effect. 3. The problem at hand seems to be the H. pylori infection which is a bacterial infection of the stomach lining which causes wear and tear in the stomach. This bug is acquired by the oro-feacal route. What this means is that someone with H. pylori sheds the bacteria through their stools. Sometimes, because of poor hand hygiene, they may pass it on to others, especially through food. The new victim ingests these bugs and in this way H. pylori finds a new home to infest. I don't think your husband having a breath test will add to anything if he does not have symptoms. 4. An unintentional weight loss may signify a gastric ulcer (in opposition to peptic ulcer)5. You may benefit from a look down into the stomach through gastroscopy. It will give a great deal of information. Your weight loss is also an indication of getting you a CT scan of the abdomen to ensure that there is nothing dangerous in play. 6. Treatment would include amoxicllin, clarithromycin and and an acid tablet such as omeprazole for a 10 to 14 day course. Since these recommendations include a gastroscopy, you will eventually have to visit a physician or a gastroenterologist to have it done. Gastroenterologists are also excellent at managing h. pylori infections, along with ulcers and gastritis."},{"Patient":"I have been running a fever of 100.6.I passed out yesterday morning and have a major headache since.It was hard to even open my eyes all the way last night. Temperature is back to normal today but my head feels like it will pop off my head from the pain.","Doctor":"With this limited information, a best case scenario is that this may be a bad sinus infection. The worse case scenario is that it may be an infection related to the brain or eyes. Sinus infections are much more common and much more likely an explanation. At least statistically speaking. A sound advice would be to see your doctor. After asking you a few questions and examining you, a more detailed explanation may become available. They would definitely try to rule out the 'worst case scenario' diagnosis and let you know if you need further testing or treatment with antibiotics. If the fever continues, I am afraid you will not be in a position to 'sit it out'. You will have to see a doctor at some point."},{"Patient":"Hi. I have had yellow watery diarrhea along with some sharp abdominal pains and deep cough in my chest. The cough has be persistent for more than  a week. The diarrhea started a week ago. Tonight I got the chills and had to soak in a hot tub to warm up. I feel as if I have a fever as well -  this is very unusual for me. I typically get head colds once or twice a year but this is different and lingering.","Doctor":"It could be atypical pneumonia . Atypical pneumonia could present also with diarrhea. You need Xray , sputum culture and sensitivity to confirm diagnosis. Once confirmed you will be started on antibiotic by your physician. Make sure you take the full course of antibiotic that is prescribed by your physician. Never take over the counter antibiotics. Taking over the counter antibiotics is one main reason for developing antibiotic resistance."},{"Patient":"My daughter has a cold and have given her Mucinex to take twice a day.

It may contain a decongestant, mucolytic (medication to break up the mucus), cough suppressant, antihistamine.One or most of these may be present in a mixture.During a cough/cold or flu , the nasal passages are inflamed and irritated which means that they would bleed easily.The bleeding may not be due to the medication but due to this inflammation of the lining of these passages.I hope this helps"},{"Patient":"Thank you.

With regards to bad sweating at night, that could be due to electrolyte imbalance possibly caused by flu bug. Remember you are not totally recovered yet. Apart drinking water, I'd recommend to start taking oral rehydration salts (ORS) to replace the lost electrolytes. Furthermore, I advise to have your meals regularly and don't skip any to avoid hypoglycemia attack as long as you do not have fever anymore. If the bad night sweating won't improve, then, should consult with your doctor to rule out other major causes. Wish fast recovery.

Unfortunately, there is no drug without these adverse effects, as their action is by stimulating the central nervous system.

It constantly feels like there's a build up of fluid that won't drain.","Doctor":"Hello,I understand your concern. Covancaine is not the right drug in this case, first because you seem to have an ear infection and you need an antibiotic, and second because Covancaine is to be avoided during pregnancy, due to potential harm to the fetus. I recommend you see an ear doctor for a prescription. If you live in a country where you do not need a prescription, you can get a topical antibiotic for ear infection, as well as pain medication. If the pain and fullness in the ear continues, despite the medication, then by all means see a doctor.

My stomach is bloated and I haven t had a good bowel movement in a couple of days.","Doctor":"Hi,    Thanks for the query. I understand your concern.  *   Your stomach  bloating/ weakness could be because of lack of appetite, staying in bed ( no movements ) & constipation due to fever/ any antibiotics taken may add to the symptoms.  - Habitual constipation can have all the symptoms together along with fever. -  A stomach flue can have all the symptoms too. -  Fever due to typhoid does show these symptoms.  * solution consists of taking rest/ drinkings lot of warm water with pinch of salt & quarter spoon of water in a glass,( avoiding dehydration & stimulating bowel movements) & light diet while you have fever. Over the counter paracetamol pill taken with warm diluted milk & sugar  would give some relief from fever. Light to digest food can be taken, A glycerin suppository for constipation can be used.     With some relief to fever... you can add lactobacilli preparation/ ranitidine pill over the counter     Consult your family physician if there is no relief / Fever is not controlled/ there is vomiting or pain in abdomen along with other symptoms .    He would examine & do needful investigations & advise for specific treatment as per need.

Radiation of pain to shoulder and neck through 11 cranial nerve. So I suggest you not to worry.. Please do these following things.. 1. Gargle with Betadine in Luke warm water. 2.

In 1998 Dr Christopher Strakosch of Brisbane (Endo) finally diagnosed me with Hashimotos and advised that my concerns were correct as I felt like I had been slowing dying in the past 9 months, (after seeing many doctors that did not have a clue) Dr Strakosch said if I hadn t got treatment they would have been burying me in 2 weeks or less. It was a long arduous recuperation period, as you can imagine. In 1998 I had been ill for many months, with so called Chronic Fatigue, a chronic chest infection and heart palpitations and constant feelings of burning from the inside out. I lost approximately 15 kilos in 1998 when the weight suddenly dropped off within one month. In March last year 2013 I went from 70 kgs to 55 kgs after what I thought was another thyroid storm happening. The GPs that I had been seeing are in one medical centre and it seems that no doctor was taking my claims seriously. Turns out that I was over-prescribed the synthetic thryoxine meds by 100mcgs per day. My TSH levels had dropped down to 0.05 here in Australia, I had been suffering terrible buzzing of the head, horrible balance and spatial problems, blurring vision and eyes drying badly ( got to the point I felt unsafe to drive) it affected me so badly that I had a dizzy attack while sitting at my desk at work in Feb 2013 (last year) and due to the job I was doing which commanded quick thinking and an analytical mind I was put off as I worked autonomously in an office situation where I was alone a lot of the time. I went away with friends last year to recuperate and get some much needed assistance dealing with this major health issue that seemed to take my very mind and memories from me. I now have a TSH level of 0.08 but find that my brain still isn t functioning very well and my balance is terrible most of the time and my ears feel like they are constantly full of pressure. I had 3 degenerative disks in my neck and whilst our government assistance (Centrelink here) are trying to rehabilitate me for work again, I am so concerned that my health issues are not being addressed correctly as my head has so many various aches and pains and lack of concentration I worry if I ll ever work again. I have raised 3 children to 2 separate marriages, my youngest son is 19 next month and divorced years ago due to physical and mental cruelty from my second husband to my eldest son who is 31 next month(of my previous marriage who was also physically and mentally abusive) . Is there anything you may be able to recommend to assist the regenerating of my previously analytical mind and to do the physical things I used to do without head buzzing, balance problems and hearing and vision problems ? I am slowly getting better but some days I am so vague I can t even keep up with conversations let alone remember simple appointments which is causing much grief and embarrassment. My income is obviously sadly reduced which omits many treatments and tests which may be of help. Would appreciate any assistance or advice. Kind Regards Karen Macdonald Queensland Australia","Doctor":"Hello Dear. You are probably having symptoms of anxiety and depression because of so many issues. Firstly you need to take your medicines regularly as prescribed by your doctor. Secondly go for regular follow ups. I will also tell you few tips which you need to follow on regular basis1. Connect with others: Loneliness and isolation set the stage for anxiety. Decrease your vulnerability by reaching out to others. Make it a point to see friends, join a self-help or support group, or share your worries and concerns with a trusted loved one.2. Practice relaxation techniques: When practiced regularly, relaxation techniques such as mindfulness meditation, progressive muscle relaxation, and deep breathing can reduce anxiety symptoms and increase feelings of relaxation and emotional well-being.3. Exercise regularly: Exercise is a natural stress buster and anxiety reliever. To achieve the maximum benefit, aim for at least 30 minutes of aerobic exercise on most days.4. Get enough sleep: A lack of sleep can exacerbate anxious thoughts and feelings, so try to get seven to nine hours of quality sleep a night. If you struggle with sleep, adopting smart sleep habits can make a big difference.5. Be smart about caffeine and alcohol: If you struggle with anxiety, you may want to consider reducing your caffeine intake or cutting it out completely. Same with alcohol, which can make anxiety worse.6. Train your brain to stay calm: Worrying is a mental habit you can learn how to break.

Just a red area on the to of his head in the balding area of his scalp. This occurred after wearing an acrylic beanie in the rain for approximately 4-6 hours 2 days ago.","Doctor":"hello, there are 2 possible reasons for that  one is acrillic caps are made up of synthetic materials. Also perspiration difficult through the cap. Apart from that , the cap make the scalp warm and sweat more also. Wearing it for longer time make scalp sweaty. so it can produce the worn area a sweat rash, just like you discribed.    Other thing is it can be,  contact dermatitis to the synthetic material it is made up of.  What can you do is you can change your cap to a wool one which  is a natural material and it let perspiration well also. Therefore it cause scalp less sweaty and warm. Also if you are having contact dermatitis to acrillic it would also reduced from wool.    Topical anti steroidal +antibacterial cream would help in healing the rash. keep the area well dried after having bath. Lactocalamine lotion can reduce itching.   Don't use the cap when the climate is warm. it will aggravate the problem."},{"Patient":"Hello ,My 3 month old son has a really bad cough which it sounds like he has mucus and is having trouble coughing it up .

I have had this for a week now and I have been using oatmeal lotion and coconut oil to try to get it to go away but nothing is working. I feel generally not good so I haven t been getting exercise, which has caused my sciatica to act up. I can t get into see my doctor until Thursday! Can you tell me what is wrong with my face? I feel tired and sometimes nauseous. What does this sound like to you?","Doctor":"Hello! Thank you for your query. It will be more accurate if You send back a picture of your rashes in the eyes to properly diagnose it. But commonly, you may be having a Hypersensitivity reaction(allergic reaction). Did you change your facial cream, soap, lotions recently? Have you been using any new product? or did you have any intake of a new food or medicine recently? If so, You may be having an allergic reaction to it, though allergic reactions may occur on the second exposure, a lot still occurs on the first exposure.  Allergic reactions are caused by a substance that is recognized by the body as a foreign substance. Your body has a natural defense system(immune system), if exposed to harmless substances such as pollens, lotions, creams, dustmites, medication, your body over reacts, this over reaction may cause a rash, itchy eyes, runny nose and difficulty of breathing. To totally eliminate the problem, first is you must identify the substance that you are reacting to and eliminate it. Then as quick remedy as you are still looking for the trigger(substance that caused it), you may take Antihistamine like Cetirizine 10mg once a day before bedtime to lessen the itchiness. This may cause a little bit of drowsiness so I suggest you take it before bedtime and choose products you use on your face, use hypoallergenic soaps, creams, lotions. Furthermore, If you can't send back a picture I suggest you consult a physician to clinically assess your condition. I hope this helps.A feedback is greatly appreciated!Thank you!"},{"Patient":"I have broke out in a rash down both sides of my stomach, starting under my breasts down to about my hips.

Your doctor would send you for a laboratory investigation which involves taking a swab of the vaginal discharge, and running a culture and microscopy test on it.The result of this investigation would determine which type of STD it is and the appropriate antibiotics to be prescribed.It is only after a vaginal swab is taken that you can safely be given empirical antibiotics such as intramuscular ceftriaxone and metronidazole tablets pending when results come out.I hope i have answered your question.I'd be glad to answer more questions if you've got any more.Warm regards."},{"Patient":"I m a 44 yr old female with no trauma to abdomen.

I am in a private service in Dhaka. I felt chest pain for last six months and so i we went a cardiologist in SQUARE Hospital in Dhaka. He gave me some test like ECG,ECHO, blood tests and ETT. All other tests except ETT was found normal. I was for 9 and half minutes in excercise tolerance test. I didn t feel bad. But the cardiologist told me that he found some significant changes in third stage of test. So, he stopped the test and he advised me to do an angiography for better result. He suspected that there may be block. Then I went to another cardiologist in National Heart foundation of Bangladesh and he advised me not to do angiography right now. He prescribed me some medicines like Anclog plus, Anzitor, Ecospirin and advised me to walk an hour every day. By this time I talked to my sister in USA. She consulted with a doctor there and the doctor said if ETT test is positive it will be better to do an angiography. Then I went to another cardiologist for third opinion. I went to Prof. Dr. Afzalur Rahman, MD (Card), Phd (card), FACC (USA), FRCP (Edin), FRCP (Glasgow), Fellow in Intervention cardiology (France & USA), awarded CRT2009. He also checked my tests and advised me to do an angiography as soon as possible to be risk free and to know the actual result. So I did Coronary angiography under him at Square hospital. My CAG report was normal. There was no blockage in heart as per result from CAG. He advised me to feel free and stopped all medicines. He told me that the cause of the pain might be from muscle strain or Gas. Still I feel chest pain and it seemed at middle of chest and sometimes from middle to left or right. I feel tired sometimes. I have my CAG report and CD with me. I need your suggestions and advice","Doctor":"Hi, If your Coronary Angio report is normal than you should not worry from the cardiac point of view. Their are many causes of chest pain. Yours can be due to musculoskeletal pain or due to costochondritis (it is an inflammation of joint between bone and cartilage of chest). Both are benign conditions and can be easily treated by a pain killer. Positive ETT can be false as it has a sensitivity of around 70% but Coronary angiography is the final test and if that is normal then there is nothing to worry. So relax and don't worry about it.

They ran a chest xray and 24 hrs later called me that they found something that could be a mass, aneurysm. blood clot or just blood vessels. I am freaking out...someone will call me to schedule at CT. My great aunt (maternal) had a thoracic aneurysm. My blood pressure was 122/60 at my appt on Thursday. Is that any indication of a problem","Doctor":"Hi, Yes, you definitely need to get a CT done soon. Only this will tell whether you have any serious underlying disease. Till then it is very important for you to monitor your bp. You should not have high BP. Preferred target bp will be below 130/80 mm Hg. You should also not smoke (if you have been smoking), avoid junk food and do not exercise very much. Don't worry and let the result of CT come. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further. Take care Regards, Dr Sameer Maheshwari, Cardiologist"},{"Patient":"I have had a bad sore throat for three days now.

Infection spread by direct contact and through sharing objects like phones, utensils,touching doors knobs etc. Proper hand washing and sanitizing of all shared objects help prevent spread of infection.If precautionary measures are taken, you do not need to worry too much if your family members are healthy ,since the infection mostly cause symptoms in people with weakened immune system,hospitalized or on antibiotics.The person infected is most contagious when he/she is actively having the symptoms.

But if the infection is settled, cough should get lesser by time.    Persistent cough would cause continuous forceful contraction of chest and abdominal muscles . This would lead to muscle pulling and you would have pain, stiffness, and tenderness of muscles. If you are not a Wheezer you can have ibuprofen or other NSAID together with local diclogenac sodium gel.  But you have to stop the cough which cause the muscle pain.   If you are a topic or person with wheezing it is better to have small dose of prednisolon for 3,4 days, deriphillin, and a mucolytic like bisolvin for another week. If it is still not settling, need to do your blood investigations full blood count, CRP, ESR and chest xray.

Given your symptoms I would think of Scabies as well. It is one among the common parasitic infection in the body. The bug generally spreads through contact with a person or a place that is infested by it.These bugs generally burrow through your skin's top layer and lays egg in the epidermis of your skin. The egg hatch and gives rise to even more bugs. The intense rash that your experience is due to the antigenic property of the eggs and the bugs crawling through your skin.Scabies is generally curable; however, you must remember to stay away from others and vacuum clean your home thoroughly especially your beds and pillows as they cans till have eggs or bugs.The treatment of choice would be Permethrin lotion. You must apply it from your neck and work it down your body. Allow it to dry in your skin for 8 to 14 hours after which you can bath. Sometimes oral drug Ivermectin is also prescribed.During the course of the treatment the rash might seem to be more reddish and vigorous however after 12 to 14 days you will be completely healed.  You might even be prescribed cetrizine or other such anti histamines to decrease the itching. You should try to avoid intense itching. The intensity of itching will subside eventually when the bug no more lays egg and number of bugs decreases.Regards,Dr Manoj Pradeep MD"},{"Patient":"My husband has been sick for about 8 days First couple days acted like normal cold symptoms, post nasal drip, itchy ears and eyes.

It would have been more helpful if you have mentioned your age and sex.Travelling by flight with an active ear infection can be uncomfortable especially if there is fluid accumulated behind your tympanic membranes/ ear drums. The answer to your question would be yes you can fly; however, you must remember that there a chances where you might feel very uncomfortable during take offs and landings. This is because of your body trying to balance out the difference in pressure.You can try a sterile ear plug or a good pair of headphone that can minimize the discomfort. The only time when you must try to avoid air travel is if there is severe fluid accumulation behind your ear drums as there can be chances of rupturing your ear drum and consequently bleeding from your ears."},{"Patient":"I was diagnosed with pneumonia starting to develop in my lower left lung yesterday, I have been running fevers on and off but today I have an extremely stuffy nose and if I barley move it exerts me and I have to catch my breath.

Since I'm not sure about your age, geographical area, occupational history, and social history, i would like to give you an overview.It could be caused by a discharge from the back of your throat (what we call post-nasal drip), it could be some chronic infection such as tuberculosis/ fungal infection), or side effect of a drug.

What is the antibiotic you are using? there are several reasons for the persistant symptoms. May be the antibiotic is not sensitive for the bug.  Other thing is even if the infection is settled oedema and inflammation inside the middle ear take few weeks to settle. So vertigo and dizziness may take few wks to fade.   Any way if the infection not settling we have to do culture abst of the ear discharge. Sometimes fungal infections also produce similar symproms.

My question is with eos levels high can I be around children or others or am I at risk for another infection.   Thanks  Mamaw in Ky","Doctor":"Hello,It appears to me that you are a bit confused on the advise given. Let me try to explain you in a different way to the best of my abilities. Generally, high eosinophil level indicates a sensitive person. By sensitive, I mean a person who is highly susceptible to allergies. So high eosinophil levels does not necessarily mean that you must stay away from others.On the other hand, you state of a history of prolonged lower and recent upper respiratory infection. This infections either viral or bacterial have the tendency to spread through respiratory droplets. This is the reason your GP might have asked you to stay away for a while from your family.Finally, high eosinophil count might also suggest a higher risk of allergies like pollen for eg and not commonly infections."},{"Patient":"I had been taking Diovan for a number of years and insurance company suggested I replace Diovan with the Losartan since it was cheaper.

As an adult, she can tolerate upto 500 to 600 mg of acetaminophen given no history of liver disorders. So you need not necessarily worry about the interaction. Moving on, if she is just having a day of cold symptoms without fever you can of course try Nyquil along with Robitussen for the cough only at night. Additionally, she can also try steam inhalation and humidifiers for symptomatic relief. Ask her to remain well hydrated. If there is nasal congestion she might try nasal saline sprays as well. These are all supportive measures and have no adverse effects. If she develops fever, abdominal symptoms or respiratory difficulty then it is advisable for you to visit you PCP, just to rule out flu or strep.

It would help to have a little more background on you, for example do you smoke? Do you have asthma or allergies? The red throat can be explained by persistent irritation to your inner lining of your mouth due to persistent coughing. Taking a cough suppressant medication like Phenergan Dm + Codeine is a good idea, as well as Tessalon Perles to stop the cough reflex and allow you inner throat lining to heal.

I have been through your question.Related your concern I think this could be yeast (Candidiasis) infection. Furthermore you should know that when a rash is present in an area where skin on skin contact occurs, this is known as intertrigo.  Intertrigo is inflammation of the skinfolds that is caused by increased moisture and friction in the areas where skin meets skin.  The area with intertrigo can produce intense itching, burning sensations and it may also have a terrible foul smell similar with your symptoms.  The inflamed skin under the breasts can be an open door for Candida.  What I suggest for you is  to keep dry your underbust,minimize moisture and friction with absorptive powder, wear light, non-constricting,and  get the right type of bra.

It is constantly itchy. Recently I put a cortisone ointment and it is still itchy. I suspect it is a Buruli ulcer (mycobacterium) which is being reported as a problem in that area. I am traveling with 2 types of oral antibiotics, 1. Cephalexin 2. Amoxicillin & clay. Do u think I should try one of these, or what do u suggest? Many thanks carmella","Doctor":"Hello Carmela!I have been through your question.  Related your concern you should know when Buruli ulcers are identified early and treated appropriately with  antibiotics, the prognosis is good and not need a surgery. If treatment is delayed, surgical debridement, skin grafts, extensive wound care, and physical therapy may be needed for the sequelae. What I suggest for you in conditions that you have to choose between two antibiotics is oral cephalexin, although the best choice of treatment of mycobacterium ulcers is combination of rifampicin with streptomycin for 4-8 weeks.I hope my answer helps you.I wish you a quick recovery."},{"Patient":"Good evening.

As per your symptoms history is concerned you are already under treatment by your local doctor. And your history indicates you have an infection.so your doctor must have advised you an antibiotics if not ask them to add in IV line. Do a blood WBC, DC and ESR test. If possible do a blood culture to identify any specific bacteria present or not. Do check his sputum for pus cell and AFB. If required send to lab for Culture for tuberculosis because in every cough more than 3 weeks we recommend a sputum(RE/ME/Culture). You can take any cough preparation with bronco dilators to remove cough. Discuss with your doctor to add cough formula(terbutaline sulphate+bromhexine+ guaiphenesin+ammonium chloride)For this you need expert's guidance by your treating Doctor.

In the last week, the cough has become much heavier/harder and I feel a near-constant pressure on my chest, just over the breastbone. Is it possible this could be walking pneumonia or something similar?","Doctor":"Hello,I read your message and understood your medical issue.I see that you have a persistent dry cough which has lasts for a long period of time (6-8 months). I don't know what you have used to treat it but this is a quite long period of time for the symptom to be self-limited even if left without any treatment.When laughing, much more pressure develops inside the pulmonary system which makes the obstruction of the airways to become more evident. Chest discomfort and the sense of pressure in the chest followed by a more severe cough especially after a physical efforts are signs that show that the pulmonary function is getting down.It can be due to pneumonia of course or as a side effect of the previous pneumonia episodes. In this case, the pulmonary function is reduced because of atelectasis which is the substitution of the pulmonary tissue with fibrous tissue. Anyway, I do not think that this is your case even though I do not expel it as a differential diagnosis. What I think is a possibility of GERD (gastro-esophageal reflux disease) which has not been treated adequately and might have caused aspiration pneumonia. Anyway further tests are needed to rule it out and treat it adequately like chest X-ray, upper endoscopy and a good physical examination. Bronchitis may become chronic and may lead to more severe pulmonary disease like COPD. My suggestion is that you must see your doctor and do the respiratory tests to evaluate the function of your lungs. Chest X-Ray is very important in this case.It can be due to an allergic reaction as well. Maybe you are constantly exposed to the allergic substance that causes obstruction to the airway and produces the symptoms. Mediastinum organs like large vessels, trachea, lymph nodes etc. must be evaluated. Tumors in this region, also the pulmonary tumors are not usual and if found they are successfully treated. My advice is that you must do at least the pulmonary tests, a chest X-ray and all the random laboratory examinations and if you can do the allergic tests.Hope this is helpful for you.Dr.Albana"},{"Patient":"My husband said that one of his workers had some sort of episode today.

And should my husband keep an eye on this guy in the future?","Doctor":"Hello,I read your message and understood your medical issue.I think this man must be sent to the hospital to do some examinations and to consult with a doctor.These symptoms and their rapid onset may be related to many diseases some of which may be dangerous. A migraine with aura is a possible diagnosis. This is a type of a headache associated with strange sensations and sometimes with nausea and chills. The sense of disorientation associated with nausea and chills can be related to vertigo which can be caused by an ear infection, ear toxicity etc. or if it is due to a central cause it can be more serious. An ear examination with an otoscope by a doctor is the first thing to be done followed by the general examinations including the neurological ones. Ear infection is successfully treated with drugs (antibiotics if the cause is bacterial). If the cause is something by a central origin a head CT scan must be done. If this is his first attack of migraine he must be careful to distinguish the triggers of his migraine headache and avoid them. OTC pain relievers are usually enough to control this type of headache.Next, if the worker did not use to have his meals regularly, drops in blood sugar levels could be a possible cause. Measuring his blood pressure and blood sugar levels will give more clue regarding his health problems.At the end, I am still thinking that this man needs further evaluation by a physician in order to take proper measures in time and prevent future episodes.Hope this is helpful for you.Dr.Albana"},{"Patient":"Hi I am inquiring on behalf of my brother, who was camping just after Thanksgiving in the woods of central Pennsylvania.

He was awakened by a sudden, sharp pain in his toe, and said it felt like being stuck with a hot needle. He thought it was a spider bite. Now, the toe is rotting and exuding copious amounts of puss. (ruined two pairs of shoes) Two doctors have tried and failed at diagnosing, and I suspect a parasitic infection. I want to show you a picture.(?)","Doctor":"Hello,I read your message carefully and understood your medical issue.If you can send me a picture of his toe it would be great. Also, mention to me if your brother has ever had some other associated symptoms local near the toe or systemic like fever or whatever.Usual causes are paronychia (infection of the tissue surrounding the nail) and onychia (infection of the nail itself). When the causative agent is fungal the progression of these two conditions is more chronic. When it appears suddenly it is caused by bacteria (staph. aureus is the most common).Parasites are unlikely to cause this type of infection.Anyway, my suggestion is that your brother must send a pus sample to the bacteriological lab to discover the exact cause. The result will discover the proper antibiotic that can work with that infection.These types of nail infections happen after a little trauma of the nail or the tissue around that that next becomes inflamed.

They can go way on their own but usually, they need a topical treatment. The treatment is based on the cause that has created the lump. Apple cider vinegar and aloe vera gel can be used as home remedies to treat the eyebrow lump.I believe that maybe a re-infection has occurred or it has produced a more severe swelling of tonsils and the neighbor structures of the throat.

It happens due to the blockage of the Eustachus tube that is a communication between the throat and the ear cavity. When it is blocked due to inflammation or mucus it causes an elevation in ear pressure. A higher ear pressure makes the eardrum less flexible and the sounds can not be heard properly. This will give the sense that the ear is blocked. Finding blood marks in your ear buds after using them may be because of a bruise of the ear canal walls or because of a damage of the eardrum which may be serious and leads to permanent hear loss. During the flights, the pressure in the ears increases more due to a higher atmospheric pressure. Do not block your ears with cotton while sleeping. It not a smart action. It does not help in ear pressure and pieces of cotton can be left inside the ear.My advice is that you must see an ENT doctor. He will see if there is any damage in the eardrum membrane or not. To unblock the Eustachus tube you can try the Valsalva maneuver. Take a deep breath and hold it by keeping your mouth and nostrils closed with your hand then try to blow air from your nose while keeping the nostrils closed. If you hear a popping sound in the ear means that the maneuver was a success.If you can not perform this maneuver than you can try to blow a balloon with your nose.Nasal sprays, decongestants, and mucolytics may be helpful. Put warm compresses near to your ear.If you have any ear infection you may need antibiotics too.Hope this is helpful."},{"Patient":"Hi DR.

There are lots of pathological causes responsible for bleeding and leakage from anus. However, let me give my opinion here. As per your history is concerned do a clinical examination by your treating doctor and confirm that it is herpes infection. \\"As\\" medication is concerned you are taking right medications. Continue with these medications and complete its course. After completing your antiviral course please consult with a surgical specialist in your area and he will carry a clinical examination to confirm fistula with abscess present or not. If present he will advise a higher antibiotics like cextriaxone with metronidazole for few days and do surgical repair. So to confirm the matter is essential because in viral infection there is no discharge.For this you need expert's guidance by a general surgeon in your area.Hope this helps."},{"Patient":"Hello. I recently had sex and used a condom that contains spermicide. The next day my penis felt extremely sensitive to touch at the tip and also feel a slight burning sensation in my urethra. I have read online that some people have reactions to spermicide and I feel some may have entered my urethra. I went to urgent care and was given a cream to help. What can i do to reduce my pain? It s not agonizing pain, but it is very discomforting and feel a burn at the tip of my penis.","Doctor":"Hello!Thanks for using healthcaremagic.comI read carefully your question and understand your concern. I think you had allergic to the latex condom spermicide.Perhaps you are allergic to the latex condom, one of the most common allergic reactions caused by sexual intercourse.Although they say it affects only 1% of people, you can actually develop the allergy or sensitivity to the condom with the progressive contact with the latex or the material from which the condom is made - and / or the lubricants and spermicides it contains.Generally, the symptoms of the allergy to the condom appear within a few minutes of penetration, but then they may get worse. In cases of irritation, hives and more severe dermatitis occur hours later. For example, the formation of blisters on the skin that has been in contact with the latex is common.I see similar cases amongst young people who visit my clinic. In the first meeting, I advise my patients to avoid using latex condoms to prevent these symptoms, but obviously always remembering the important premise of practicing safe sex. If you are sensitive or allergic to latex, you can resort to polyurethane condoms or animal skin condoms.Polyurethane condoms work in the same way as latex condoms: they offer protection against pregnancy and prevent sexually transmitted diseases. Animal skin condoms, however, do not provide protection against STDs.While commonly allergic to condoms is not too serious, exposing yourself to such symptoms over and over again can be both annoying and harmful and can compromise not only your sex life but your overall health. And here the situation can be worse.So the best advice I can give you is to consult with your urologist properly diagnose your case, analyze what risks you have been exposed to in contact with latex condoms, and of course know what other contraceptive methods you can use that are harmless and comfortable.Kind regards,Dr. Oscar Martinez"},{"Patient":"I am on Day 4 of: Violent/explosive ongoing diarrhea that is green and mainly watery Sounds like a thunderstorm going on in my abdomen Painful cramping in abdomen very uncomfortable Pretty much Non stop passing gas which I have to be really careful otherwise I end up changing my pants due to the watery diarrhea being released Do not how I could go in to a doctors office with the awful noises I am emitting as well as needed to sit on the toilet frequently.","Doctor":"Hello!

Usually the frequent urination with burning sensation,lower abdomen pain and bad odor of urine are the symptoms of an lower urinary infection usually caused by escherichia coli bacteria and it is common in women because of a shorter urethra than men.  So what I suggest for you is to do a physical examination (giordano test) by a doctor, urine test, urine culture,abdominal echo (to see renal function), full blood count and azotemia/creatinemia (to see the renal function) to define better the diagnosis and to start antibiotic (usually I prescribe bactrim or ciprofloxacin if you aren't allergic).You should continue to drink ( as you have done)a lot of water and tea to clean the urinary tract from infection.

Anal yeast infection can often be caused by yeast in the digestive system or vagina that has migrated to the anus. Usually itching and burning  are the most common signs of a yeast infection  and can spread from the vaginal opening to the labia and anus as you have. What I suggest for you  first is stop using vaseline, diaper ointments and hydrocortisone  and second meet a gynecologist, to do a  direct sample test for candidiasis and to start antifungal cream treatment (clotrimazole or  miconazole) as soon as possible, use probiotics, eat yogurt and wear loose pants and cotton underwear .I hope my answer help you.I wish you a quick recovery."},{"Patient":"Hi I am 5 months pregnant and I have a Pilonidal cyst.

Would you recommend more tests I.e. Abdominal ultrasound? Sample of her liver tissue to be taken for biopsy? EtcThank you very much!John","Doctor":"Hello!I have been through your question.Related your concern  I think that you should know  that the elevated levels of ALT/AST is moderate and usually fatty liver is the most common cause of unexplained persistent elevation of liver enzyme levels after hepatitis and other chronic liver diseases have been excluded. The good news is that fatty liver is a reversible condition that can be resolved with changed behaviors and  often has no symptoms and typically does not cause permanent damage. But when fatty liver is caused by an underlying condition, it can become harmful to the liver if the cause is not recognized and treated.The most common cause of fatty liver is alcoholism and other common causes obesity,hyperlipidemia, diabetes some medications. You should know that potential causes of liver transaminase elevations include viral hepatitis, alcohol use, medication use, steatosis , and cirrhosis. So what I suggest for your wife in this situation is  doing a physical examination by a hepatologist, exclude viral hepatitis (lab test HBsAg  and anti HCV), abdominal ultrasound to see the local situation of your fatty liver and to exclude cirrhosis and lipidograme. Furthermore, a liver biopsy  definitively allows  to exclude alternate causes of elevated liver enzymes, and it is the only method to distinguish (in certainty) non alcoholic fatty liver from non alcoholic steatohepatitis, and  it provides information on the stage of the disease. But it belongs the hepatologist, based on your data to decide to do or not a liver biopsy because as all invasive procedures exist some risks.I hope my answer help you."},{"Patient":"My daughter of 6 years, very healthy, has been having stomach cramps and throwing up since Thursday.

Please type your query here...Hello, in May 2009 my daughter then aged 21 started experiencing sever pain to her chest in the area where the ribs join the sternum. The incident occurred whilst lifting heavy weights at work and took the form of a very sharp and significant pain to the point where it was thought she was experiencing a heart attack. It was subsequently diagnosed as Costa Condylitis. Since that time she has remained in pain in the chest area and has now been further diagnosed as having Fybro Myalgia to the joints. We have seen 2 separate consultants at our local hospital, she has undertaken Cat scans, MRI scans, 2 hydro cortisone injections and had loads of different tablets to try and relieve the pain. Just recently we attended the National Hospital for Arthriic dieases in Bath but unforunately after 3 days they decided they could not help her and sent her home. She has not been able to work since May 09 and I wonder if you give any suggestions to help?","Doctor":"Hello, You should see a rheumatologist as he is better qualified for such things.

It is my left ring finger and it is all swollen at the top of the finger and purple and red, however close to the nail it is green. She put me on an antibiotic called cephalexin 500mg two in the morning and two at night. Ive had two doses so far and ive soaked my finger in warm water, warm epsome salt water, and made a past of baking soda and epsome salt and let it sit for about an hour.

In women, inflammation in the vagina or in the region around the vaginal opening (called vulvovaginitis) can be painful when exposed to urine. Inflammation that results in burning or pain is usually caused by infection but sometimes by noninfectious conditions.Overall, the most common causes of burning or pain during urination are-Bladder infection (cystitis)-Infection of the urethra (urethritis) due to a sexually transmitted disease (STD)If you have oe of these symtoms you should cosult with the local doctorThey include-Fever-Pain in the back or side (flank pain)-A recent history of insertion of a bladder catheter or other instrument-Immune system disorders-Repeat episodes (including frequent childhood infections)-A known urinary tract abnormalitySome tests that you should have if the symtoms dure more than 3 days are:-The first test is usually urinalysis.-a urine culture to identify organisms causing infection and determine which antibiotics would be effective.The cause is treated. Often the cause is an infection, and antibiotics provide relief in a day or two.

The most common causes of bumps are harmless and don’t require medical treatment, unless you have discomfort. Here are some of the possible reasons for raised skin bumps:-Acne is the most common skin condition-Allergic eczema is an allergic skin reaction that produces an itchy, red skin rash. The rash may consist of raised, red bumps that ooze, drain, or crust.-Boils are infected hair follicles that look like red, raised bumps on the skin. They can be painful, but they eventually go away once they burst and release fluid.-Molluscum contagiosum are small, flesh-colored bumps with a dimple in the center that often form in all parts of the body. They can arise from skin-to-skin contact with someone affected with them.-Psoriasis is a skin disease that causes scaly, itchy, red patches to form on the skin. It can affect any area of the body.-Seborrheic keratoses are round, rough spots on the surface of the skin.  They may be skin-colored, brown, or black.Treatment for raised skin bumps depends on the underlying cause. Most of the common causes of skin bumps are harmless, so you probably won’t need treatment. However, if your skin bumps are bothering you, you might be able to have them removed for cosmetic reasons.In cases where additional medical treatment is required, your can take medications that can help eliminate your skin bumps and the underlying cause. For a bacterial infection, you may need antibiotics.You should see a doctor in case:-skin bumps change or worsen in appearance, or last for a long time-you are in pain or they cause discomfort for many days-you don’t know the cause of the bumps-you suspect you have an infection or skin cancerThe doctor will perform a physical examination and inspect the skin bumps. The doctor may also perform a skin biopsy to test if it is necessary.Hope my answer helped you,thanks!"},{"Patient":"I have what looks like a blood clot on the bottom left side of my lip.

But when a sore throat persists and you can't find relief and after two antibiotics treatment as you have , it's something to be taken seriously. Some possible causes of a chronic sore throat include infection of the tonsils, strep throat, allergies, mononucleosis, inhaling air pollutants, smoking ore inhaling through the mouth instead of the nose.To successfully treat a sore throat, you have to know what is causing it. What I suggest for you is dong a physical examination by an ENT doctor to see in detail  the local situation of your throat and ears, full blood count and throat culture test to do a differential diagnosis between some the most probably of above mentioned causes ( non treated well tonsillitis or strep throat, mononucleosi and allergies) .I hope my answer help you.I wish a quick recovery."},{"Patient":"I am a lactating mother of my baby who is approx 3.5 months, and she is suffering from lose motion for about 2 months now.

But remember you have to drink plenty of water since you are sun exposed and swimming in sea water. At least you have to drink 3.5l of water for the whole 24 hours. Not only that, you should wear clean swim suits. Don't wear wet swim suit for whole day. When you are finished swimming remove wet clothes and wash your body including perineal area with a soap free pH balanced shower gel or a body wash thoroughly and dry well. Continue with antibiotics. Wash your swim suit well and dry before using it in next day. Don't just dry (without washing) the swim suit and use it on next day.

Last night I noticed another incision site further up my leg was red all around it, warm to the touch, and a hard bump underneath the skin. So now I have 2 different areas that are red all around it, warm to the touch. Are they related? What do I do?","Doctor":"Hello!I have been through your question.According your concern I think the diagnosis for the two cases is erysipelas.  It is an infection of the upper and deeper dermis and superficial lymphatics, usually caused by Streptococcus bacteria on scratches or otherwise infected areas. It appears as a red, swollen, warm, and painful rash, similar in consistency to an orange peel. More severe infections can result in vesicles , blisters, and petechiae. The infection may occur on any part of the skin, including the face, arms, fingers, legs, and toes,but usually it tends to favour the extremities. You should know that people with immune deficiency, diabetes, alcoholism, fungal infections, and impaired lymphatic drainage,ulcers in the skin,surgical incisions are at  increase risk to have erysipelas. So, what I suggest in your case is a physical examination by an Infection Disease Specialist to find the proper reasons  of this situation, to do a differential diagnosis with cellulitis and in the same time you should start antibiotics (usually I prescribe ampicillin or amoxicillin, or penicillin if you aren't allergic) prescribe by your doctor. Furthermore, you should try to rest as much as possible with the leg elevated above your hip (you may support your leg on some cushions while lying down). It is also important to drink plenty of fluids and to get up and walk around from time to time and taking ibuprofen if you have pain.I hope my answer help you.I wish you a quick recovery."},{"Patient":"i have been itching constantly for almost a month now. my primary care physician thought i had an alergic reaction to a change in laundry detergent but the itching hasn't stopped. the redness/bumps associated with the visit to the physician have healed but now new bumps are forming all over.","Doctor":"Hi..Welcome to HEALTHCARE MAGIC..I have gone through your query and can understand your concerns..As per your complain eruption of recurring bumps all over the body which  are itchy can be due to common causes like:-CONTACT DERMATITIS that is an allergic reaction which occurs when skin comes in contact with certain agents that your body is allergic to like skin cosmetics, detergents, soaps, fragrances,leather, latex, poison ivy etc..-FOLLICULITIS or generalized hair follicle infection caused by Staphylococcus bacteria leading to formation of painful bumps over different parts of the body..-Another cause can be food allergy or side effect of medicines..Consult an Allergist or an Infectious Medicine Specialist and get evaluated and a thorough clinical evaluation and investigations like  blood tests to rule out allergies and infection, micorscopic examination of scrapings from lesion can help..As of now you can take anti allergics like benadryl for relieving itching and do cool compresses over bumps..Once the cause is ruled out it will be treated accordingly..- In case of Contact Dermatitis you will be advised anti allergics, topical steroid ointment application and also avoiding exposure to allergen when it is ruled out...In recurring conditions Immunotherapy will be advised to you..-In case of folliculitis antibiotics oral and topical and topical steroids can be advised along with anti allergics to control itching..Hope this information helps..Thanks and regards.Dr.Honey Nandwani Arora."},{"Patient":"diagnosed as reactive (1-16) to valley fever. office just called to tell me to reduce dosage to 200 mg per day. pharnacy just called to tell me that long time use of simbastatin may be issue and waiting for dr retrun call. just recovered from pnuemonia on left lobe. little confused and dr nurse could not tell me how severe VF is on me.no signs like rash or cough. help!!","Doctor":"Hello!I have been through your question.Valley Fever (Coccidioidomycosis) usually causes a primary pulmonary infection (as I think you have based on your history) which often resolves without therapy.  In some cases a chronic  pulmonary infection or, rarely, disseminated disease (extrapulmonary infection) may develop. Primary pulmonary cocci usually may not need treatment but it depends from risk factors , illness severity indicators, and findings on follow-up of patient’s symptoms, exam, and serology every two to four weeks. Usually it  treats with fluconazole 400 mg daily or itraconazole 200 mg twice daily until titer is stabilized at ≤ 1:4 and asymptomatic. The  infection  could be clear  when the  titer is usually 1:2, 1:4 or undetectable. Persistence of titer > 1:4  as you have (1-16) may indicate active infection includingdissemination, but to be sure I want to ask this titer result is after starting  the treatment or in the beginning. I think is a good news that your symptoms are improved  but you need to do a physical examination by an Infectious disease specialist,every two weeks titer, lab test  and chest radiography as well to define better your situation. I hope my answer help you.I wish you a quick recovery."},{"Patient":"Hello! I am a female who has been experiencing vulva itching for about a week.

Bradycardia does not explain chest pain, but may lead to fatigue and shortness of breath. I would like to review his ECG report for a more professional opinion.

Anyway, I would recommend performing some further tests: - a fibrogastroscopy for possible GERD or esophageal spasms - a chest X ray study and pulmonary function tests - complete blood count, PCR, ESR for inflammation - a exercise cardiac stress test to investigate for coronary artery disease. You should discuss with his doctor on the above tests. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further. Regards, Dr. Ilir Sharka, Cardiologist"},{"Patient":"Hi. About 2 weeks ago, I started to itch along my arms and hands. I noticed about two bumps on my hand and several on my arms. I thought they were mosquito bites. They were very itchy and hurt just a little but went away after a couple of days. They left dark spots however, which I thought a bit odd, as a mosquito bite usually would not leave such dark marks on me. Then about last Thursday, I started to itch under my chin. A swelling that made me look like I had a double chin developed but by Monday, it had gone down and has left a dark mark.

She was 8.5 years old at that time. She underwent initial treatment at TMH in Mumbai . She underwent rest of the treatment at Bhopal Cancer Hospital under DM Oncologist . Protocol 841 was followed. She completed the initial Induction successfully in 2006 end itself and started the consolidation phase in 2007 . During the consolidation and induction phases she had 4-5 packed RBC transfusions and 8-10 platelet transfusions .She completed the entire consolidation phase medication including spinal taps except the last leg of ARAC . At this time her platelets had dropped down to levels of 30,000 to 40,000 and were not recovering .This was around June of 2007. We were advised to wait and watch for the marrow to recover. At this time , my daughter underwent a 2 month course of ayurvedic medication given by Dr (Vaidya) balendu Prakash of Dehradun and in a month her platelets came back to normal levels . This medication was stopped then. At this time, her local oncologist then advised us to let her stabilize and after a month start maintenance phase under Protocol 841. We started this in September 2007 and the maintenance medication ended on 1st June 2009. It is now 1 year and six months since she is off oral chemo and she has completed 4 years from diagnosis in November 2010. During the last 18 months she has had her share of Cough/cold and virals like any child and has been treated with appropriate antibiotics under guidance of her oncologist. She is now 12 years old and full of energy like any school going child. She has been having CBC done every month in the last 18 months and her reading span is as below ( tables also appended below) • Platelets – 1.7 Lacs to 3 lacs - Recent ones are between 2.1 lacs to 3 Lacs • WBC – 10000 – 13500 - Neutrophils and Lymphocytes are in normal ranges unless she has a infection or fever. • HBG – 11.5 – 12 .5 The area I needed advise on was the range of WBC – You can see from the chart below that it is almost constantly above 10000 and has even gone up to 13400 after which it has again come down. Most of the time she has had no fever. Even the last reading which you see of 13800 wbc, she has had only cough and cold with no fever.I have personally spoken to the pathologist who confirmed he has examined peripherals and smear carefully and morphology of cells Is absolutely normal. Her oncologist has suggested it may be a infection and not to worry . He also said he did not see the need of a marrow examination. I have had her throat and ears examined and they seem to be fine. I was slightly worried about this trend of WBC and wanted to consult you. Needed your expert advice on how we should take her case at this time and way ahead.

Allergies or eczema of the penis usually cause itching. so change you soap to a ph treated unperfumed soap. If you are using condoms latex allergy  also has to be considered.    If you are having red penile head only with milder other symptoms im thinking of psoriasis also. for that steroidal topical cream is better.

Then 4 weeks after that ago I woke up in the middle of the night with Chest pain, racing heart. I went to A&E again and I had an ECG, and full blood tests and everything came out normal again. I went to my GP and he said it could have been an SVT.

What are the chances of getting shingles myself?   I had chickenpox in my childhood.  Should I get the shingles vaccine.    Will rinsing my hands in peroxide prevent the spread?","Doctor":"Hi,Shingles are basically reactivation of chickenpox virus,anyone who had chickenpox may develop shingles. Shingles are contagious but less so than the chickenpox,but its important to note that the varicella virus (chickenpox virus) is contagious not the shingles. That means direct contact with shingles blisters, would cause chickenpox in someone who has never been infected with the virus or someone who never been vaccinated against chickenpox.In simple words shingles cause chickenpox in close contacts and shingles never cause shingles in close contacts. Coming to your case,since you had chickenpox in childhood you are immune to virus and you never develop chickenpox virus and you can safely take care of your mother.Since you have chickenpox in the childhood you may develop shingles in adulthood and it can be prevented by vaccination. So its better to take vaccine.Rinsing your hands will definitely decrease the chance of contamination to others, so you should maintain good hand hygiene by frequently washing both hands.Finally one more thing, once the blisters scab, shingles are no longer contagious.Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further.Regards,Dr. Shinas Hussain"},{"Patient":"I have these sores coming up on and around my stomach. There will be one or two at the same time.

You haven't mentioned the age of your mother or any other medical problems (diabetes, immune suppressed drugs, etc) she has. These factors increase surgical site infections.

I WAS just about 1 ms. pregnant. I am a recent Cancer survivor with previous low immunity, but have only had 1 case of the flu & 1 case of strep in the last 4 1/2 ms since my thyroidectomy. By Sun, afternoon I had lost the pregnancy. By Tues afternoon I had a Rash bright red at the bottoms of my feet & now there is a rash all under my pubic hair. Is it possible this is 5ths ? Could it have been living on surfaces in that house ? They had a younger child who did not yet come down with it who was 4. I have been very heat intolerant all day.","Doctor":"Hi,Usually by the time a child develop fifth disease rash he is no longer contagious. He spread the disease to others before the rash develops.  When he is having runny nose, sore throat, cough and few days before he develop those symptoms. so it is unlikely he infect you with the virus. Also to develop the 5th disease it would take 4 to 14 days after contacting an infectious person. so it is unlikely your miscarriage on Sunday is due to  the infection you contacted on Saturday. Other thing is adults don't develop a distinctive rash as children. Most importantly feet and palms are spared in fifth disease. What I can say is it unlikely you have developed 5th disease or miscarried due to that.  You might have developed some other viral fever with rash. Hope this helps.

This more commonly occurs: (1) When the virus has been recently acquired(2) If the immune system is impaired or not working well in some way(3) Fever or excess sun exposure(4) If there is another infection present.You should consider holding off any steroids because these reduce the immune system and may increase the frequency of outbreaks in some persons.If you recently got this infection then this is likely the reason for the frequent outbreaks, they should decrease with time.If this is not the case, then you should also be screened for diabetes, infection, HIV and, very rarely, any cancers that may be affecting your immune response. This would require physical examination and blood tests as well.I hope this helps.

Looks like white spots inn the redenned area.  I gargled a little with hydrogen peroxide.","Doctor":"Hi,Well, white spots on the reddened area of gums can be due to healing tissue post gum surgery but in case if they are appearing as pimple like blisters then they can be most probably due to infection at the surgical site. A clinical examination is a must for ruling out what exactly the white spots are due to. As of now you can take another 5 days of antibiotics and also add empty stomach Pantoprazole to prevent gastric upset due to antibiotics.Along with it you can gargle with antiseptic mouthwash solution.

From your question I gather that both you and your partner have been diagnosed with Ureaplasma urealyticum and that you both have been prescribed the appropriate antibiotics. Yes, the infection can be transmitted through saliva, but since you are both infected, there wouldn't be any point in holding off kissing for the time being. If, however, you have completed your treatment and your partner has not yet started his, or is in the process, kissing and intercourse could lead to a reinfection, so it would not be advised until both of you are symptom free and have completed your treatment course.Wishing you both all the best. Hope I have answered your query.

This means it is not common for bleeding to occur during a cold or if a person is prolonged allergies. Treatment would involve the use of antihistamine/decongestant combination of medication which would be over the counter that is zyrtec d, allegra d, claritine d, benadryl d.A topical decongestant such as otrivine or normal saline can be used to help decrease the congestion. If there is any cough, then a cough suppressant can be added to reduce the cough that is dextromethorphan. This is also over the counter.Hope I have answered your query.

And Yesterday a stray dog again pinched my knee with his teeth. Wound is very tiny. Do I need to get vaccination again? Please also give quotes about the validity of the vaccination. Thanks.","Doctor":"Hi,1. Since you have completed the earlier post exposure regime in January 2006 and the duration of immunity afforded to humans by the course was found to be between two to three years,  and if one is  working/living in a high risk environment,  the British NHS recommends a booster shot one year after the last shot, and after that every three to five years intervals.2. If someone has been bitten by the dog [in between], only two doses of anti rabies Vaccine are to be given on day 0 and 3, whatever is the interval from primary vaccination.Hope I have answered your query.

Scratch can cause transmission of the rabies virus. Rabies is very fatal disease. If the dog did not appear ill during the 10 days of observation or after, then the dog is healthy and without rabies. The person who was bit does not need any rabies vaccination. But it is very difficult to trash stay dog. I wold suggest to follow appropriate anti rabies vaccination schedule according to your doctor advise. Make sure that there is no infection and pus formation at bite site. If infection occur topical antibiotic will help.Hope this may help you.

I have reviewed your query and here is my advice. If there are a number of persons with the similar symptoms then leukemia is highly unlikely because this is not contagious and only develop in a few persons in a population. Ebola is contagious but it is highly unlikely as well since it is a rare condition that has mostly died down recently. Fatigue can occur with any illness, from a common cold to more serious illness because the body is using its energy to try and get well. Headache and rash are also common symptoms, these can also occur with many viral illness. Rash associated with viral illnesses is called viral exanthem, this normally resolves as the illness improves. Mono is a viral illness and this can be the cause but there are also a lot more viral illnesses that can occur. Most persons improve from mild viral illnesses within 7 to 10 days.Hope I have answered your query.

I had an unusual episode of vertigo for a week 2 years ago - woke up running into walls, dizziness & nausea. It finally passed after a week, so this may be unrelated to present. 10 months ago I developed a sudden subtle itching in my scalp. It then moved to severe itching in my hands & feet, then torso, back & finally arms, legs. The itching comes on worst at night. Went to multiple drs. & was finally told I have dermatographism/chronic pressure urticaria with an unknown idiology but was an auto immune response. About 2 months ago I started feeling deep in my right ear like I was going to get an ear infection when I laid down to go to sleep but I never woke with one. Both ears started to take turns sharing this sensation at nights. Then, 3 weeks ago I woke up with the sensation radiating down my jaw on the right. I figured I had finally gotten the ear infection. I went to the dr. & he said ears were fine but throat looked like had infection. I did not have a sore throat, sinuses or any issues to suggest this. I was put on augmentin. 2 days later I started spiking 104+ fevers & got very weak barely able to walk/talk & got rash on legs. Went back to dr & tested positive for strep & mono both & antibiotic was switched to azithromycin & our on methylprednisolone & told to keep temp down for next 24-48 hours to reduce infection risk. 2 days later fever was gone all day. Around 9pm I laid down to watch a movie & immediately felt like I was burning up from the inside out, not like a typical fever. I became concerned because did not feel right. I made some calls & was told was just infection & to take ibuprofen & go to sleep. I woke with itchy legs at 4am, which I was used to with the urticaria. Itched it out & went bsck to sleep. When I woke up in the morning, my cheeks were flush, skin was bright red & hot & had a rash all over my body. Went back to dr & was told had scarlet fever. Antibiotic was switched for a 3rd time. After ther steroid, the radiating feeling down my jaw stopped, but the ear pain is constant in one or both ears still & ranges in severity. There has been a lot if light tingling in my temporal area, left side of cheek more than right, top of head to the point I became concerned again & went to ER. Blood tests had some low/high levels but not enough to be remarkable. MRI was done & my braces threw artifact on the scans so difficult to read. Frustrated, felt dumb & still had no answers. A couple days later I had ringing in my right ear a few times for a few seconds then light drumming in my left ear once for a few seconds. I went to ENT-pa last week, recited whole story, checked ears, nose, throat & stated all clear must just be the alignment of my jaw. This did not sound right to me as only effected my jaw once for a few days. Left frustrated again. My ears sensations are getting worse when I lay down it seems. I have also had an area in my right side in the same place & 2 areas on my left side that have had twinges of pain on & off but not severe. I did have a few days of high stomach pains that would last 30-60 mind but hen go away. I noticed tge past couple days tiny muscle spasms in my left hand, left leg & right foot. My neck on both sides has had little twinges of pain but not severe & comes & goes. My heart has started to feel discomfort past couple days, especially if I try to lay on my left side. Tonight, I m just afraid to go to sleep & developing a light flushing in cheeks it feels & little rashes that come & itch then fade some but still have a speckle presence. No fever. I. Really tired & want to go to sleep & just feel something is wrong but cannot get any answers.

Anxiety is the body’s natural response to danger, an automatic alarm that goes off when you feel threatened, under pressure, or are facing a stressful situation.In moderation, anxiety isn’t always a bad thing. In fact, anxiety can help you stay alert and focused, spur you to action, and motivate you to solve problems. But when anxiety is constant or overwhelming, when it interferes with your relationships and activities, it stops being functional—that’s when you’ve crossed the line from normal, productive anxiety into the territory of anxiety disorders.Some tips i would like to suggest you :1. Connect with others: Loneliness and isolation set the stage for anxiety. Decrease your vulnerability by reaching out to others. Make it a point to see friends, join a self-help or support group, or share your worries and concerns with a trusted loved one.2. Practice relaxation techniques: When practiced regularly, relaxation techniques such as mindfulness meditation, progressive muscle relaxation, and deep breathing can reduce anxiety symptoms and increase feelings of relaxation and emotional well-being.3. Exercise regularly: Exercise is a natural stress buster and anxiety reliever. To achieve the maximum benefit, aim for at least 30 minutes of aerobic exercise on most days.4. Get enough sleep: A lack of sleep can exacerbate anxious thoughts and feelings, so try to get seven to nine hours of quality sleep a night. If you struggle with sleep, adopting smart sleep habits can make a big difference.5. Be smart about caffeine and alcohol: If you struggle with anxiety, you may want to consider reducing your caffeine intake or cutting it out completely. Same with alcohol, which can make anxiety worse.6. Train your brain to stay calm: Worrying is a mental habit you can learn how to break. Strategies such as creating a worry period, challenging anxious thoughts, and learning to accept uncertainty can significantly reduce anxiety and fear.7. If you have anxiety that’s severe enough to interfere with your ability to function, medication may help relieve your symptoms. You need to visit a psychiatrist who will help you with medicationsHope i have answered your question. Feel free to contact me if you have any more questions. I ll be glad to help you.

Pls advise what are your thoughts on this and what i need to do now","Doctor":"Hello Dear. You are probably having hypersensitivity pneumonitis. I will tell you in briefl about the condition and what precautions you need to take.Hypersensitivity pneumonitis is inflammation of the lungs due to breathing in a foreign substance, usually certain types of dust, fungus, or molds.Causes:Hypersensitivity pneumonitis usually occurs in people who work in places where there are high levels of organic dusts, fungus, or molds.Long-term exposure can lead to lung inflammation and acute lung disease. Over time, the acute condition turns into long-lasting (chronic) lung disease.Hypersensitivity pneumonitis may also be caused by fungi or bacteria in humidifiers, heating systems, and air conditioners found in homes and offices. Exposure to certain chemicals, such as isocyanates or acid anhydrides, can also lead to hypersensitivity pneumonitis.Examples of hypersensitivity pneumonitis include:Bird fancier's lung: This is the most common type of hypersensitivity pneumonitis. It is caused by repeated or intense exposure to proteins found in the feathers or droppings of many species of birds.Farmer's lung: This type of hypersensitivity pneumonitis is caused by exposure to dust from moldy hay, straw, and grain.Symptoms:Symptoms of acute hypersensitivity pneumonitis often occur 4 to 6 hours after you have left the area where the offending substance is found. This makes it difficult to find a connection between your activity and the disease. Symptoms might resolve before you go back to the area where you encountered the substance.Symptoms may include:1. Chills2. Cough3. Fever4. Malaise (feeling ill)5. Shortness of breathSymptoms of chronic hypersensitivity pneumonitis may include:1. Breathlessness, especially with activity2. Cough, often dry3. Loss of appetite4. Unintentional weight lossExams and Tests:Your dostor may hear abnormal lung sounds called crackles (rales) when listening to your chest with a stethoscope.Lung changes due to chronic hypersensitivity pneumonitis may be seen on a chest x-ray. Other tests may include:1. Aspergillus precipitin test2. Bronchoscopy with washings, biopsy, and bronchoalveolar lavage3. Complete blood count (CBC)4. High-resolution CT scan of the chest5. Hypersensitivity pneumonitis antibody panels6. Krebs von den Lungen-6 assay (KL-6)7. Pulmonary function tests8. Surgical lung biopsyTreatment:First, the offending substance must be identified. Treatment involves avoiding this substance in the future. Some people may need to change jobs if they cannot avoid the substance at work.If you have a chronic form of this disease, your doctor may recommend that you take glucocorticoids (anti-inflammatory medicines). Sometimes treatments used for asthma can help people with hypersensitivity pneumonitis.Outlook (Prognosis):Most symptoms go away when you avoid or limit your exposure to the material that caused the problem.Possible Complications:The chronic form of this disease may lead to pulmonary fibrosis. This is a scarring of the lung tissue that often is not reversible. Eventually, end-stage lung disease and respiratory failure can occur.When to Contact a Medical Professional:Call your health care provider if you develop symptoms of hypersensitivity pneumonitis.Prevention:The chronic form can be prevented by avoiding the material that causes the lung inflammation.Hope i have answered your question.

But if the blister is large or bursts there is a chance of it getting infected,  then you have to have antibiotics. Clod compression on blood blister is a good mode of relieving pain and reduce size of blood blister at acute stage. Hope this helps.

I have been suffering for about 8 weeks with what my remote healer says is a severe case of streptococcus which has struck my entire system.. My legs, feet especially very swollen and pinching, agonizing pain, cannot wear shoes as per swollen feet. I have done everything holistic, nothing really working. Cayenne pepper was recommended by my remote healer, I am also drinking organic liquid fresh rosemary which is anti-bacterial, anti fungal, and much; usually these remedies work well on many cases. Taking also kyolic garlic, echinacea, pau d arco.. Soaking in lavendar epson salts, sea salt.. Using healing beach rocks to massage.. Eveything helps a little, but this is intense, nasty and too prolonged. I am miserable with this and have never had anything like it my entire life.. The throbbing, pinching pain is unbearable.. Ankles feel like tight ruff rope around them.. The pain shows up in other areas also, like back, neck..it is all over. I do GH3 shots, pills..lipotropics.. Everything that would address excess water. Tried homeopathic apis mell 3 five times per day.. Morinda and parotid PMG Are you familiar with energetic, psychic attacks as this is what I believe it is because the physical level remedies are not curing this and I usually respond quick to healing with correct support. So I have done everything including sea water soaks at beach. Soothing and cools heat but not swelling and acute soreness. This is no joke. When it first showed up, had it few days and I cured it seemingly; then a few days later, it came back with vengence and has not left since.. Way too much suffering, incapacitates me and do not know what else to do; have tried everything.. My remote healer usually gets rid of stuff like quick but in this case he has not accomplished..may need to see him in person, but he is in Colorado, me in Calif. so not able to do that. Hardly can walk around; worsens at night, full moon and with stress.. I massage often with the rocks in the evening and morning.. If I lay them all over my lower legs, it relieves pain, heat and I see water coming out on to the rocks at times. If I keep rubbing, I can feel water slightly bottom of feet.. I rub with isopropyl alcohol and wintergreen isopropyl rubbing alcohol; helps cool, soothe but cotton pad turns black every time on clean skin. If this is not energetic attack/psychic I know it would have been gone by now with what I have done.. Apple Cider Vinegar as well. I am extremely tired from discomfort; painful to even sit here and type on this computer. Driving me nutz, have to take bath soak just to calm down but this is rediculous.. I know the person sending this negagtive energy that causes such intense physical dis-ease.. My healer removes it, I start feeling a bit better, but it comes back and intensifies as the day goes on.. SICK AND TIRED of this.. I am normally very healthy.. Ankles are really crawl pinch and sharp pointed pain shooting all over. MUST SOAK NOW.. It hits me in upper back area under the neck and into shoulder area. It is an intense burn-feeling pain as well.. and horribly in the toes and foot pad near toes. Please assist.. I must resolve this soon, as I work a lot, busy in my career and this basically put pretty much a stop to eveything..Clothing too tight due swelling, excess body weight all WATER..","Doctor":"Hi, Thanks for your question.

I impaled the sole of my foot about 3 weeks ago on a metal belt-buckle tine ( about 1/4 in in diameter and 3/4 in long). There was no bleeding so I initially didn t think it pierced the skin although I could feel and hear it enter, like an awl through leather. After looking at the wound under a microscope light I could see a clear + shaped entry. It produced a rather large bruise on the top of my foot for a week or so but that was it. I didn t think anything of it at the time but since have had weird symptoms including: sudden lump in throat and trouble swallowing ( went for dinner with my girlfriend last week and coudn t eat - thought I was going to choke so got a doggie bag) - I thought maybe strep so got anti-b s for that yesterday. Trouble is the swab won t be accurate as I self-medicated with some penicillin I had in the house for a couple of days prior trying to relieve my symptoms. Also, a severe and sudden onset of back pain lasting several days, x-rays showed nothing and it eventually subsided. Slight temp for several days now and also I have frequent ( every 15 - 30 min ) of flash heat/sweating and I know its not menopause as I just had my hormones checked and all is normal. I thought after 6 doses of anti-b s all would be fine but no. I feel like crap, can t get up in the morn and just want to know if I should be thinking of tetanus as the culprit. I don t think I ve had a tetanus shot for about 8 years or more. Had stitches about 7 years ago and remember telling the ER staff that I had had tetanus a couple of years prior so didn t get another at that time. Should I be concerned? The initial wound on the sole of my foot is pretty much healed, no infection that I can tell...a little tender but I am walking on it...just a 1/4 in scab under the skin. Do you think I should go back to the doc? I meant to ask about the foot injury at my last visit but thought it would sound silly. thanx","Doctor":"hello. tetanus is a fatal disease without life suport caused by a bacterial toxin. initially toxin is formed near wound area and later toxin spreads to whole body. features are irritability, restlessness, locked jaw, fever, initial muscle spasm in the throat and jaw later spread to whole body including respiratory muscles.         So until toxin is removed using antitoxins patient has to b put on respiratory support.          According to your discription difficulty of swallowing is only one episode. tetanus is a progressive disease so you cant have only one episode of muscle spasm. fever and chills are may be due to the throat infection. some of your symptoms are related with anxiousness too.         anyway it is better to get your blood tests done as soon as possible complaining your worries to the doctor. hope this helps. thank you."},{"Patient":"i was bit by something about 5 days ago and its left a really hard black/red/purple bump on my leg. its really hard about an inch around and is really hot to the touch. recently i was in the shower and i noticed something sticking out of it so i put a little pressure on it and this black and brown puss literally sprayed the shower wall and so i kept squeezing to get it all out and it took about 3 minutes to get it all out until it just started to bleed. my question is, since i dont have insurance to see a doctor what can i do? just clean it? also, do you have an idea of what could have bitten me?","Doctor":"hello there.i have gone to through your history,the description of it is bit vague,but i will definitely help you outmost likely you would have been bitten by beetle belonging to a classs called meloidae which is also known as blister beetle(since you have not described any obvious animals that you noticed) and is fairly commoni would diagnose you to have an infected abscess at the bite site ,which is basically the body's response to foreign chemical which got into your body through the biteSince you have squeezed the pus out,the swelling might have subsided,but i warn you to never squeeze such lesions as there is high chances of recurrence and spread and causing an even bigger infection.i would recommend you to wash it twice or thrice daily with lukewarm water and soap and keep it clean all the time and then apply mupirocin ointment over the lesion for a week.Also take antibiotic ciprofloxacin 500mg twice daily orally for 7 days and a multivitamin tablet daily for 7 days.all this will help in healing.if it recur, or it spreads to other sites,or have a high fever,do visit a doctor immediately and dont squeeze it on your ownin normal scenario,above regimen will clear you of the same.Hope i have clarified your doubt.followup if you have doubts.good day"},{"Patient":"I m Mark!

To discover the treatment for the cyst, I highly suggest you first discover the makeup and what is in the cyst as to treat with the correct medication, dose and or intervention. A cyst is defined as a abnormal membranous sac or cavity containing fluid. Often times it contains infection, and the treatment is merely drainage and antibiotics. Other times however, the contents may be more serious or even benign. There could be simple fluid, drainage being the treatment as well, or a neoplasm, cancerous or otherwise, in which treatment is more complicated and very dependent on many factors. I highly suggest you obtain a formal workup from a physician in which you can obtain a biopsy, study of the histology of and or workup discovering exactly what is in that cyst. Afterwards, you and your physician can determine a proper course of treatment.

I am so much worse during the full moon. lymph are affected & rash under armpits & inner thigh near groin in left leg. my body is having trouble handling the die off...went into kidney failure...lowered my dose of ceftin to 500mg 2X a day","Doctor":"Hello Dear. Lymes disease is related to painful rashes on armpit and thigh, but may not be related to brain scarring. Lyme disease is usually curable with antibiotics. This is so true that some authors of Lyme disease research have stated that the most common cause of lack of response of Lyme disease to antibiotics is a lack of Lyme disease to begin with! The type of antibiotic depends on the stage of the disease (early or late) and what areas of the body are affected. Early illness is usually effectively treated with medications taken by mouth, for example, doxycycline (Vibramycin), amoxicillin (Amoxil), or cefuroxime axetil (Ceftin). These generally result in a rapid cure of Lyme disease.Therefore, if a person finds a typical bull's-eye skin rash (described above) developing in an area of a tick bite, they should seek medical attention as soon as possible. Generally, antibiotic treatment resolves the rash within one or two weeks with no long-term consequences. Later illness such as nervous-system disease might require intravenous drugs; examples are ceftriaxone (Rocephin) and penicillin G. There are no home remedies to treat Lyme disease.In those people with two or more episodes of erythema migrans rash, even years apart, it is felt that the episodes represent different infections or reinfection rather than persistence of the original infection.For relief of Lyme disease symptoms, pain-relieving medicines might be added. Swollen joints can be reduced by the doctor removing fluid from them (arthrocentesis). An arthrocentesis is a procedure whereby fluid is removed from a joint using a needle and syringe under sterile conditions. It is usually performed in a doctor's office. Rarely, even with appropriate antibiotics, the arthritis continues. It has been suggested by researchers that sometimes joint inflammation can persist even after eradication of the Lyme bacteria. This complication has been explained as an ongoing autoimmune response causing inflammation of the joint that was initially stimulated by the original bacterial infection. Oral medications such as ibuprofen (Motrin, Nuprin) can also be used to reduce inflammation and improve function. There is no evidence that nonspecific fatigue that persists after treatment for Lyme disease is related to persistent infection. The risks of prolonged treatments with antibiotics are far greater than any benefit in this situation.Of note, recent research was done to study whether longer-term antibiotic treatment of persistent symptoms of Lyme disease led to any better outcomes than shorter-term treatment. The study found that longer-term antibiotic treatment did not have additional beneficial effects on health-related quality of life beyond those with shorter-term treatment. Specifically, the researchers determined that this longer-term antibiotic treatment had no more beneficial effect on fatigue, or musculoskeletal, neuropsychological, or cognitive symptoms and disorders from Lyme disease than placeboHope i have answered your question.

I need to see the lesion myself in order to give a final opinion. The ankle rashes can be due to a possible infection, autoimmune conditions, and other causes like lichen planus, Golfer's vasculitis and troubles with veins. Try to remember any insect bites or other things affecting the interested area.It is quite usual that the rash expands to upper parts of the legs. As keflex is working the skin infection soon will disappear and  the red patch too.Soreness of legs indicates the presence of infection but not only this. You need to do a check to identify any problems with your leg veins like varicose veins or any rheumatologic conditions. Other health systems must be checked too especially kidney, liver and heart.

I also grew up with herpes on the my mouth, contracted as a child. I have no diseases or major allergies that I know of otherwise. I have had one sexual partner for several years. Our house is averagely clean, we eat organic food, I live in Portland, OR. Recently, at night I felt like bugs were biting me here and there. I thought maybe my skin was just dry and itchy. Then on my arm, the next day, a tiny mark that looked and felt like a mosquito bite appeared and I scratched it, the sore filled up with clear fluid and took at least a week longer to heal than it should have. Another one appeared next to it. Then later some on my jowl appeared. They became very crusty and seepy, not like a scar from scratching a bug bite. It reminded me greatly of the herpes I used to get on my mouth, but there were Not lots of little bumps like with herpes. Then they left a scar and faded away. I got some on the lip of my nose and they still have not healed because they keep getting reinfected by a cold weather nose drip. I got two on my left hand. One was on a finger joint and one was not, the joint one is incredibly painful and looks infected even though I keep putting antibiotic ointment on it. I have been putting antibiotic on all the sores and little is happening. I m very concerned. What is happening!!?? I barely ever go anywhere to contract diseases. I do the same thing every day and nothing carrying disease has been introduced into our house. Please tell me what this is and what to do! Thank you!","Doctor":"Hi,seems like reactivation of herpes. Herpes virus tend to hide in our nerves and reactivates when our immunity lowers. Eg. Cough any cold. Old age. Cold weather. According to your history most likely herpes. If you get frequent recurrences you should go for prophylactic therapy.other wise taking only treatment from ur GP is enough. When people under go stress.

I have copd advanced stages, but this only started when I had received radiation 10 mo ago for prostrate cancer and put in hospital for pneumonia then the staph infection. All the doctors say it is my lungs but I think it is something else. Very weak in lower back while pain is there","Doctor":"hi and pleased to answer you.All signs You are describing are found in COPD. Indeed, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a chronic inflammatory disease of the bronchi most commonly associated with other diseases. It is characterized by progressive narrowing and permanent obstruction of the airways and lungs, resulting in respiratory discomfort. More than 80% of cases are caused by smoking. But as you say it radiation can be the cause. COPD is characterized by non-specific clinical signs: chronic cough, sputum, shortness of breath (dyspnea) and pain. These symptoms are often underestimated by patients. They appear gradually, insidiously, and worsen over time by increasing dyspnea. Some daily activities become more and more difficult to achieve and physical activity decreases, sometimes very importantly. This progressive degradation is punctuated by exacerbations, that is to say episodes of aggravation of cough, expectoration and dyspnea. These episodes may require unscheduled visits or hospitalizations.best wishes"},{"Patient":"My grandma got some kind of contagious bugs that can t be seen about 10 years ago. She transferred them to my parents and sister by being in their home, cars, touching, etc. They used permethrin, dandruff shampoo, etc. If you got to them right away you could wash them away with a shower and washing your clothes. However they spread through my parents house where my sister lives and she can t get rid of them. My mom sent a fur trimmed coat over here 5 years ago and it stayed in the closet until I put it on March 23, 2014.

Patients can have different antibody responses suggesting that they have active TB even when they do not. Antibodies may also develop against other organisms which again could wrongly indicate they have active TB. In addition, different organisms share the same antigens, making tests results unreliable. These factors can result in TB disease not being identified or wrongly diagnosed.A blood test for diagnosing active TB disease is bad practice \\"In the best interests of patients and caregivers in the private and public health sectors, WHO is calling for an end to the use of these serological tests to diagnose tuberculosis,\\" said Dr Mario Raviglione, Director of WHO Stop TB Department. \\"A blood test for diagnosing active TB disease is bad practice. Test results are inconsistent, imprecise and put patients' lives in danger.\\" For that I urge you to do a prostate ultrasound (endorectal ultrasound) in a RADIOLOGIST office, and a total PSA blood test.Chronic prostatitis can be your diseases and can be the reason of your complaints.I would give you as a treatment:CIPRO 500 twice daily for 30 days.For tuberculosis suspected by urologist, I think that tuberculosis when it happen, multiples signs must be found and the most important are Anorexia, asthenia, slimming and sweating at night.best wishes"},{"Patient":"My son donated blood on 12/21/10.

My son is 20 and is a college sophomore. I m not sure at what age he became sexually active. He claims that he has known his partners and has always used protection. If he were your son,what would you do to protect him? Should we have further blood work done? The American Red Cross Counselors said this was likely a false positive . About 5 days prior to donating blood my son had the flu vaccine. I m just nervous. I feel it must be serious if they are putting him on the deferred list. Please advise this worried mother. Many thanks!!!","Doctor":"Hello Dear. There are tests to detect antigen directly rather than antibodies. Like P24 antgen tests, PCR test etc, which detects viral antigen. So you need not worry about false positive or negative results. These tests are bit costly, but it will give you conclusive evidence. Hence discuss about these tests with your doctor and ask your son to get it done.Also talk to your son about safe sex. Sex education is very much required nowadays for teenage children. It is better to avoid sex till you find a very faithful partner and then stick on to her and do not have anyone else. Better to get married at that time. Hope i have answered your question.

I am on my 4th day of antibiotic. the cough aid I am not able to take due to it giving me diarrhea and headache. The diarrhea went away, but the headache has persisted. It is not really a pain but more like a sensation that someone has a clump of my hair on the upper right back of my head and has a constant tug on it causing a burning like sensation. This hurts more when I do cough? I was told I did not have ear infection but my right ear also hurts.","Doctor":"GreetingsWelcome to Healthcaremagic.Upper respiratory infection is a very common problem. Especially as the winters have arrived. Therefore there is nothing to worry about as long as you take the right medication . Your medication seems to be good enough to relieve the infection . But i think there are few medication missing .These medication will help relieve the headache and the ear pain.Upper respiratory infection also involves the nose and the ears if they speared further. This usually results in headache due to acute sinusitis and ear ache due to infection spreading to the ear. But this is nothing serious as long as it is corrected quickly. The antibiotic is right . If i had known your weight i would have correctly mentioned the dose of Azithromycin. With this antibiotic it is always advisable to have antihistamine like ebastine 10mg at bed times and pain killer such as acetaminophen. This will reduce the ear ache and headache and  shorten the duration of recovery from the infection .I hope the answer was helpful .

This would have neutralized the infection. As far as the vaccine is concerned , you have to have 5 injections in total. a day of delay usually doesn't cause much problem and the time that has passed is a good sign ,because the risk of rabies remains for a few days . If there was no problems related to the rabies then you are in the safe zone. And let me tell you here that pain around the wound is not linked to the rabies. It shows either the wound was very deep damaging the muscles , which will take some time to heal or the wound is infected by some other organisms also. Easily available antibiotic will be enough to take care of this problem. But for that you need to visit your clinician , who will examine the wound and refer to surgeon if the wound required some cleaning. I hope the answer was helpful.

I ve heard of doctors telling women that its not common, but now that I have spent alot of time researching this, I have found I m not the only one. Antibiotics with adderall is not something to be mixed. I don t want to take antibiotics anyways, because prior to taking adderall I had chronic yeast infections; I was rx antibiotics many times and the result has been that I have developed a super resistant yeast infection. The infection has been impossible to kill. I m open to just going off the adderall for a couple weeks to doctor my yeast infection with antibiotics and being persistant in taking probiotics after I (hopefully) kill it. However, I m concerned about what to do after that. I m not going to go off my adderall permanently. Adderall has changed my life for the better, I m not even the same person, and I m in love with the new person I ve become: I even got a 3.9 GPA, with the help of adderall. Things I have tried: I drink at least 3 bottles of water a day, I typically stay away from dairy (I might have cheese on things, but I never consume lots of milk, ice cream, yogurt, etc.), I ve tried to do the probiotic yogurt to help good yeast grow (however I only helped the super yeast bug come back and become much worse). I have had success with taking garlic pills (natural supplement that kills yeast), but it also kills good yeast. How can I maintain a healthy vaginal chemistry while on adderall? Is there a combination of garlic supplements and probiotics (pills, yogurt) that I could take on a regular basis?","Doctor":"Buddy I appreciate your concern.I know few people who come to clinic use ADDERALL.I generally prescribe it for ADHD(attention deficit hyper active disorder) or in cases of Narcolepsy(excess daytime sleepiness,loss of muscle tone suddenly).But the drug components of ADDERALL(amphetamine and dextroamphetamine) are having abusive property.I think you are going through the phase where adderall made you worried and the yeast infection is nothing to do with it.So please follow the suggestions1.Take FLUCONAZOLE (150) twice a week for first week,then once a week for subsequent 4 weeks.Alternatively ITRACONAZOLE(100) capsule can be used once daily for 10-12 days.2.A complete blood work is needed to review any underlying condition.Like COMPLETE HEMOGRAM,LIVER FUNCTION TEST,FASTING AND PP BLOOD SUGAR,HIV 1 & 2.3.If you are on steroid,get rid of it in a slow manner.4.Use alternative drugs,which boost your memory,make you think clearly,your academic performances.MODAFINIL(200/400) is a very good alternative with minimal side effects.5.Do a lab test to confirm yeast infection.Bacterial vaginosis can also leads to vaginal discharge.And do a culture sensitivity test(c/s).The c/s result confirms the sensitive antibiotics.Hope this will help.STAY HEALTHY,STAY BLESSED.THANK YOU"},{"Patient":"Dear Doctor, This has reference to my 33 yrs old daughter.

A dermatologist was suspected of melanoma last night, but did not recommend biopsy. my left big toe looks to have less colorful,slimmer sreaks,too. what is your view on this? I appreciate your answering the question","Doctor":"Hello,First of all I would like to tell that the streak you explained is unlikely to be a melanoma. Melanoma's to explain in general terms would be a mole growing without no control. You might monitor closely for growing size of the lesion progressively and irregular margins. If the lesion is constant then the chances of melanoma are low.Moreover you mentioned that the streak goes away when you use vinegar, a melanoma doesnt go away.Secondly, if you are prone to fungal infections then there are chances the lesion a result of that. I would advise you to start with oral antifungals alongside topical. Maintain feet hygiene. If your nails appear broken then it can be a sign of iron deficiency as well.Follow up with your doctor if the lesion grows or if additional signs like fever develops."},{"Patient":"I have cvid and have been on IvIG for a little over four years i frequently run a temperature as well as constant nausea and diarrhea at least 1 migrain a week most recently I have experienced chest pain I don t think this is a heart attackand lower back pain lightheadedness and some difficulty breathing","Doctor":"Treatment for CVID-1)Ig may be administered intravenously or subcutaneously. Solutions of 3-12% intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) can be used on a regular basis to maintain a trough level of 400-500 mg/dL in adults. A dose of 400-600 mg/kg every 2-4 weeks is usually required. In patients with structural lung damage, a trough level of 700-800 mg/dL is required.2)Cyclosporin A has been successfully used in patients with CVID and lymphoid interstitial pneumonitis. The administration of anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody has been used to treat autoimmune thrombocytopenia and neutropenia.3)Antimicrobial therapy should be initiated at the first sign of infection. A narrow spectrum of drugs should be used when culture and sensitivity results are available. The prophylactic use of antibiotics should be avoided because of an increased risk of infection with fungi or other resistant organisms.Specific therapy is often necessary to target the organ system involved. For instance, patients with chronic lung disease often develop airway obstructive disease that requires treatment with inhaled corticosteroids and other asthma medications4)Surgery is required to treat the complications of common variable immunodeficiency (CVID). Chronic sinusitis may require endoscopic sinus surgery. Severe autoimmune thrombocytopenia or hemolytic anemia can be treated with splenectomy. Biopsy should be considered to exclude infection or malignancy in enlarging lymph nodes.If you have any doubts  let me know.Thanks"},{"Patient":"On 27-05-2016, I got operated my broken left ankle and its supporting small bone.Doctor has inserted screws at the ankle and plate with screws to the small bone.

You seem to have done the right thing as it needs to be taken within 72 hours of unprotected intercourse to prevent pregnancy from happening. Since the pill is hormonal preparation it may cause certain side effects temporarily like abdominal cramps and vaginal discharge, which should settle down over a period of time. The pill would prevent pregnancy by causing withdrawal bleeding within 3 weeks from the day of its intake. In case the bleeding does not happen by 3 weeks, you need to take a urine pregnancy test and seek medical attention promptly. Hope the information provided would be helpful.

I am already on 25 mg atenolol for tachycardia arrhythmia, and I am wondering if there is a chance that i have cardiotoxicity due to the chemo protocol. When my feet get very cold my toes stay numb for hours. I have had a blue nose for the past month or so and my family keeps pointing it out... What is wrong with me?","Doctor":"thank you and pleased to answers you.Most cancer patients are treated with some form of chemotherapy, and because patients are now surviving longer, the long-term effects of chemotherapy have become a major issue. A common long-term toxicity for patients is fatigue, for which there is no magic pill or simple solution. One potential remedy is exercise. Survivors with profound long-term treatment-related fatigue might benefit from testing for autonomic dysfunction by an electrocardio physiologist. Chemotherapy, can result in damage to the peripheral nerves, which in some cases can become permanent. Peripheral neuropathy can cause weakness, numbness, tingling and stabbing or burning pain, normally in the hands and feet. Some patients treated with chemotherapy experienced peripheral neuropathy one to three years after treatment. A recent study presented at the annual meeting of the American Society of Clinical Oncology showed that about one-half of cancer patients with chemotherapy-induced neuropathy had symptom relief from duloxetine (Cymbalta), an antidepressant drug.  In another hand, studies have shown that behavior modifications, yoga or acupuncture could be helpful for a subset of patients. “Anything that is good for a patient’s overall health such as exercise is certainly worth encouraging. For cardiovascular toxicity, there is no treatment that can repair heart damage induced by chemotherapy and patients are treated similarly to patients with traditional heart disease.may this help you and best wishes"},{"Patient":"I have suffered Eagle Syndrome symptoms including syncope for the last 10 years.

After about 10 weeks the wound doctor attempted to close the wound from the bottom up and two drains. Within 5 days MRSA developed, or was already present when the wound was closed, and another surgery to open the wound and clean the infected tissue. After a week’s hospital stay IV antibiotics, and then home IV Vancomycian for 3 weeks, and a 14 day Zyvox dose the tissue cultures are coming back clean, at least as of 3 weeks ago. The wound is at last almost closed, with small amount of Seroma fluid still occurring. It is packed daily with gauze and Tobramycin solution (sp) and dressed by home care nurse. For the past 2 weeks the pelvic area below the wound has developed a pocket” or edema and is causing pressure pain in the pelvic area and now in the legs and feet. My temp is not elevated, in fact it is somewhat low, around 96.2 at periods during the day, and then will go to around 97.0 F. My question is how is it determined if the pocket which is getting larger is edema or more built up fluid due to the wound closing. Can the MRSA still be present with a low body temp? Can the pain, more of an aching pain going down the legs to the feet be caused by the fluid building up? What should be the next steps to determine what is going on?

But nowadays fortunatly we do have medications that are really effective in hep C. Detailed investigation needs to be done in order to see what type of medications are needed and to check the effect of the medication once they have been started. For that you will have to get PCR quantitative for Hep C virus in order to find out the quantity of the virus present in the body. At the same time you also have to do Hep C virus genotyping so that the type of virus is identified and specific drugs are started .i have seen many people  see the benefits of these medications . Sofosbuvir and Ribavirin are one of the combination that can be used , but there are many others which have to be given according to genotyping.As far as the value 244/85 is concerned i think it stands for 85 as AST and 244 as Alk Phosphate . Which shows the level of effect the virus has had on the liver. Therefore to avoid permanent damage or other complications , time is very important . An ultrasound must also be done to find out the status of liver before starting medications .I hope the answer was helpful .

Lymphocyte counts are of no value for distinguishing between viral and bacterial infections. Nodules can be scarring, granulomas, infection, fungus, virus, and cancer. Here in Morocco, nodule let us always suspect tuberculosis caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis agent, but there are others mycobacterium type less agressive than mycobacterium  tuberculosis but they can give such things like Mycobacterium avium.

During the early weeks of gestation, developmental abnormalities in the brain and spinal cord can happen, and will cause Primary arachnoid cysts. Secondary arachnoid cysts more uncommon as primary cysts, are seen as a result of brain diseases (meningitis, tumors), or head injury, or as a complication of brain surgery.  Surgery depends mostly upon the size and the location of the cyst.As untreated, arachnoid cysts may complicate to neurological damage in case of size expansion of the cyst, I propose to you new surgery: microneurosurgical techniques and endoscopic tools allowing minimally invasive surgery (surgically remove the membranes of the cyst or open the cyst so its fluid can drain into the cerebrospinal fluid and be absorbed)."},{"Patient":"Hello, Doctor. I am a 45 year old diabetic with severe neuropathy (have taken a nerve test given by a neurologist), and I ve lost 3 toes already. I am currently in wound care to treat a large ulcer and osteomyelitis on my remaining big toe--treatment includes hyperbaric and IV meds thru a picc line. I also see a pain management specialist. He prescribes me Lyrica, Morphine ER 60mg 1-2 every 12 hrs., and Oxycodone 15mg for breakthrough pain. I am thinking about relocating to Rhode Island due to family issues and because I d be living with a nurse with 20 years experience who could help me manage my condition. However, I am fully aware that this country (perhaps with some reason) has developed a paranoia about prescribing pain meds and we ve let the government take over what SHOULD be a doctor s job. I am very anxious about making this move, because you can t just call doctor s in another state and say: Hi, I need Morphine and Oxycodone. Is that okay? and you ALSO can t pay for a round of consultations to see who the right doctor is.

The essential component of treatment is the management of chronic neuropathic pain.  Many analgesic neurogenic drugs are available in this indication. These drugs come fromSeveral families:  antidepressants (tricyclics: LAROXYL, serotonergic-noradrenergic:EFFEXOR, CYMBALTA) neuroleptics (RIVOTRIL, NEURONTIN, LYRICA). All these treatments Have notorious adverse effects and should be initiated at low doses (especially if renal insufficiency is present), Then adapted very gradually according to the clinical response.So you have several medications choices with a high response rate, you should definitely consult a neurologist."},{"Patient":"I am Charmaine, 45 female, 1,54m tall and weight is 70kg.

Sulfonamide containing antibiotic Cotrimoxizole which is commonly prescribed to treat urinary tract infection appears to be the cause for his skin problem which occurs during the first 4 weeks of antibiotic therapy, usually between 1 and 3 weeks.

But none of these people explain the exact symptoms I am experiencing. I get these tiny little bubbles or blisters along the more sensitive skin on my feet (only the soles).

They are normally no larger than about 2mm at the most in diameter. And the only way that they stop itching is if i pick them open and drain the fluid inside them. The fuild that is secreted when i pick them open is a clear odorless fluid. It seems somewhat sticky. I do not have athletes foot. I have used anti fungal ointments for treatment of athletes foot, and it has not stopped whatever this is.

So now should i worry about it and see neurology?will this cause infertility since we are just starting trying to conceive.","Doctor":"Dear Madam, Hi & Welcome.Based on the history and the lab tests done you seem to be suffering from hyperprolactinemia (increased prolactin level in the blood) due to small tumor (microadenoma) in the anterior pituitary gland.Hyperprolactinemia can cause infertility due to amenorrhea or irregular menses, breast engorgement and galactorrhea (increased milk secretion).You need to consult a gynecologist who is specialized in fertility treatment.You may be given treatment in the form of dopamine agonists like Bromocriptine or Cabergoline which are effective in decreasing the prolactin levels and they may also shrink the tumor.Cabergoline is usually preferred over since it is more effective and causes fewer adverse effects than Bromocriptine.The response to therapy should be monitored by checking fasting serum Prolactin levels and checking tumor size with MRI. Most women (approximately 90%) regain cyclic menstruation and achieve resolution of galactorrhea. Therapy should be continued for approximately 12-24 months (depending on the degree of symptoms or tumor size) and then withdrawn if prolactin levels have returned to the normal range & no adenoma (cyst) is seen on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). If drug therapy for prolactinoma doesn't work or you can't tolerate the medication, surgery to remove the tumor may be an option. Hope the advice given above would be useful.Best wishes."},{"Patient":"I have been having these spasms in my diaphragm, It feels like I need to cough all the time. and it feels like i cant get a full breath of air.

I had a temp of 99.9 last night, and today I am getting sharp pains in the area of the red spot. Aslo the spot is hot and tender to touch.","Doctor":"Hello,I read your message and understood your problem.I think that the infection with Mycobacterium marinum has re-occurred. If you are exposed to the bacteria you tend to get re-infected time after time especially now after 3 surgeries and antibiotic therapy that have weakened your immune system.You must stay way from nonchlorinated water, from pools and swimming. If you have an aquarium at home get rid of it. Exposure to seafood markets or aqueous environments predisposes for the infection.  It is very important to eliminate the chances of reinfection because a long lasting infection may damage the soft tissues and cause complications.My advice is to see an infectious disease specialist and do some tests. We need to be sure if it is a reinfection with Mycobacterium marinum or a co-infection with some other organism.The antibiotic therapy is a little bit long lasting. Usually, patients need to take antibiotics for 4-6 weeks but sometimes they need  a very long treatment 25 months or more. See your doctor again for a proper physical examination and test. If you are still on antibiotics continue them as long as the infection will vanished.Hope this will be helpful for you.Dr.Albana"},{"Patient":"My skin is swelling everywere and causing discomfort,itching and numbness in my hands,feet, and face, also forming tough lumps & fluid pockets in some places,its worse at night.

About 76 hours ago, before my girlfriend took him home for the night I remember him telling me he was itchy.  about 15 hours after that, 67 hours ago she saw him at a local store picking up medication.  When she asked what it was he apparently said, \\"oh, my doctor said I've got chiggers or something\\" and she looked at the medicine he was prescribed and called me at work to look it up.  The medication was Permethrin Cream, 5%.  I looked it up and found out it was for scabies treatment.  Within the next day, he was apparently very badly broken out; within the next day and a half following that his girlfriend, my girlfriend's daughter with whom he's had considerable contact with, was broken out and my girlfriend  had complained the night before had an itchy bump on her hip.  That evening my girlfriend and her daughter went to the doctor and were tentatively diagnosed with also being infested with scabies. A skin scrape was done on each but the labs haven't come back yet as it was a Thursday and they were told it would be at least 3-4 days before the lab results came back.  Both have lived in the same apartment since the news and have been in contact with many things in the apartment.  Since it was immediately after/during the move-in many thing were still yet unpacked.  A lot of the large furniture had been moved around (many times to see how it looked) by the boyfriend and two other people at the same time, as well as me and my girlfriend separately on the last occasion (the one he told me he itched badly as he left).  For three nights I slept with my girlfriend there.  The night before they went to the doctor we had about 20 minutes contact where she manually stimulated me with lubrication and held each other off and on throughout the night.  I was home very little after the initial move to help move things around and touched very few things after I got home late at night after waking up, but I did move the furniture (suede-like cover) and only wore clothes that the original infested person did not touch.  There were, however, things (clothes and otherwise) in our bedroom he did carry that were on the carpet.  I showered in a hot shower, as I always do, every morning before and after this became evident.  As soon as I found out I have never returned to the apartment, have not had any physical contact with my girlfriend or anyone else for that matter.  I am still showing no signs and used about a quarter tube of Permethrin cream on myself the day we all found out.  I'm staying at my parents' house at the time, as the doctor my girlfriend saw advised, for a week or longer.  I still can't really tell any signs but am getting ready to give myself a second treatment of the Permethrin cream as I was not aware I should wear full covering clothing and not wash it off for 24 hours.  I applied the cream fairly thinly except my hands, arms, feet, ankles and genitals (as we had had prolonged contact at that point the night before).  My girlfriend has sprayed things in the apartment down with anti-lice spray after vacuuming but has just nearly three days later gotten to wash all the clothes that were on the floor in bunches of hangers because they were not yet put away.  Mine have been washed in hot water and dried on high heat, as hers have (considering neither of all have been done yet); mine have been delivered to me without her ever touching them (had her wear long rubber gloves) and I have also washed and dried them at my parents' house without me ever touching them.  I have never had scabies before and read that symptoms may take 4-6 weeks to manifest.  My girlfriend and her daughter have both had them within the last year for the first time and have manifest symptoms soon after exposure.  What are my chances of being infested, infesting my immediate family (with which I've had fairly minimal contact now) and what is my best course of action?  --  Thank You for Your Advice -- Travis","Doctor":"Hello ,Thank you for your question .  (Scabies )Scabies is a condition of very itchy skin caused by tiny mites that burrow into your skin. The itching is caused by an allergic reaction to the mites.Scabies spreads very easily from person to person. It can affect people of all ages and from all incomes, social levels, and living situations.With treatment, the scabies mites die and the itching goes away over a period of days to weeks. Without treatment, the mites continue to reproduce under the skin, causing more sores and itching.Scabies has two main symptoms:Severe itching that is usually worse at night. Small children and older adults tend to have the worst itching.A rash with tiny blisters or sores . Children tend to have worse skin reactions than adults.How is it treated?you need to use a special cream,These products contain permethrin.Permethrin 5% cream (Elimite) is the treatment of choice for scabies. Permethrin 5% cream is applied to clean, dry skin. For best results, clip and clean all fingernails and toenails. Permethrin is usually left on the skin for 10-14 hours and then washed off in the shower. It is best to apply permethrin at bedtime and then wash it off in the morning.Lindane 1% cream or lotion is an older medication that is rarely used because it is potentially toxic to the nervous system (leading to symptoms such as dizziness or seizures). Some scabies have become resistant to Lindane.Ivermectin pill(s) (Stromectol) is an oral medication that is active against several parasites. It is not FDA-approved for use in scabies but has been used in cases with very heavy infestations. Ivermectin is not used in small children or in women who are pregnant or breastfeeding.Malathion 0.5% lotion (Ovide) is usually used for head lice and is not approved by the U.S. FDA for the treatment of scabies. It is irritating to the skin. It must be used only as directed and should be kept out of the reach of children because ingestion may cause organophosphate poisoning.Benzyl benzoate lotion is an older treatment for scabies. It can be irritating to the skin, especially in people who have eczema.Crotamiton lotion or cream (Eurax) is approved for use in adults with scabies. Treatment failures with this drug are more common than with permethrin.Sulfur-based lotions, creams, or soaps have been used but are less effective than other options. They should not be used in people who are allergic to sulfa.Most creams or lotions are applied to the entire body from the neck down. In most cases, you leave the medicine on for 8 to 14 hours and then wash it off. Be sure to read and follow all instructions that come with your medicine.To make sure that all the mites are killed:Wash all clothes, bedding, and towels that you used in the 3 days before you started treatment. Use hot water, and use the hot cycle in a dryer. Another option is to dry-clean these items. Or seal them in a plastic bag for 3 to 7 days.Clean and carefully vacuum the room or rooms used by the person who had scabies.After treatment, the itching usually lasts another 2 to 4 weeks. It will take your body that long to get over the allergic reaction caused by the mites. Antihistamines (such as Benadryl), steroid creams, or, in severe cases, steroid pills can help relieve itching.If you still have symptoms after 4 weeks, you may need another treatment. and visit doctor.I wish was helpful for  youBest regardsDr. Ahmed Habib"},{"Patient":"i went to my gyne i thought i had a yeast infection because it was itchy n when my boyfriend would stick his penis in it would hurt until we started going and it would burn when he would cum in me i left that part out the first time i went she told me she couldnt tell if i had a yeast because i was on my period she gave me pills anyway it all stoppes the pain the itching and burning it was fine for a few months now its all happening again i went back thinking i had the same thing a yeast i told her she looked said she didnt see anything gave me diff medicin anyways again n it didnt fix the problems this time its been going on for a little over a month now n i dont know what it is ive been testes last time was DEC. when i went in when this problem the 1st time and everything was fine","Doctor":"HiThank you for asking HCMI have gone through your query.

For the past 11 days I have been taking doxycycline(100 mg daily) as I am in a malaria infected area of the country.  Yesterday I began having symptoms of strep throat, which I have been prone to get my whole life and I am in constant contact with a large group of children.  Today my symptoms worsened, I have a fever of 102 degrees, have a bright red throat, and swollen lymph nodes; and without thinking I took amoxicillin(500 mg) this evening-about 10 hours after I took doxycycline this morning.  So my first question is what should I do, continue taking doxycycline to prevent getting malaria or take the amoxicillin to get rid of strep throat? Obviously I would rather have strep than malaria, but is there some other antibiotic I could take?  My second question is about the side effects of doxycycline.  As I was concerned about the previously stated drug interaction, I began looking online and also discovered that vaginal itching is a side effect of doxycycline as well.  I only started noticing vaginal itching this morning and I don't know if this is a serious side effect and what you would recommend for me to get rid of it.Thanks!","Doctor":"Hi there,I understand your predicament when you have limited access to medical care.  To answer your first question, yes continue taking both antibiotics.  They are from different groups of antibiotics, and tackles different kinds of infection.  The only catch is that doxycycline has been known to reduce the effectiveness of amoxycillin, but I would not have you stop the doxycycline and expose you to the malaria risk.  Go ahead with the amoxycillin if that is what you have on hand, and make sure to complete the full course.  If you find that indeed the amoxycillin doesn't work so well this time (you will be able to tell after 2-3 days), see if you can get antibiotics from another group, like erythromycin or cefuroxime.The answer to the second question is that no, it is not a serious side effect.  It is probably just a yeast infection, also called candida, and is a common side effect of any antibiotic, because it kills off the natural bacteria in the vagina.  You will need to get some antifungal pessaries like clotrimazole to insert into your vagina, or if you prefer oral medication for any reason at all, something like fluconazole will help.

I have been diagnose last yr with UTI so im afraid that it will come back, isn t fever a sign of infection in the body?","Doctor":"HI, thanks for using healthcare magicFever is part of the body's inflammatory response which means that it can occur with infection, allergies or trauma though infection is the most common cause.Viral, bacterial, fungal or parasitic infections can cause fever.Cough and colds are usually due to viral infections though in some cases, the symptoms can be due to bacterial infection requiring antibiotics.It is quite possible that the fever is due to your cough/cold.Infections can affect the menstrual cycle so this may be the reason for the irregular bleeding that you noticed. At this stage, it can be monitored.I hope this helps"},{"Patient":"Dear Sir, i have a question in distinguishing a heart problem and deconditioning...i am 29 years old, previously professional athlete for 10 years but limited my activity due to arrhythmia episodes which were PSVT mostly but many many many PVCs as well...my functional class also reduced to III class...now i am apparently in calss I but i have two questions which i am not able to answer...i have started jogging on tread mill with 6th speed for 20 min daily...during jogging not any problem max one or two PVCs but about an hour after stopping the sports my heart beats becomes irregular...many PVCs as if even simple movement triggers it, chest discomfort and it may even linger to many hours if i get really tired...i am not able to distinguish whether this is deconditioning or still my heart is not doing well?","Doctor":"Hello, I passed carefully through your question and would explain that your symptoms could be related to an electrolyte imbalance or dehydration, probably caused by jogging. Coming to this point, I would recommend checking your blood electrolytes. An ambulatory 24-48 hours ECG monitoring would help exclude possible cardiac arrhythmia. Hope I have answered your query.

He is one year out from having the whipple for pancreatic cancer. His recent scans revealed a small soft tissue area around a vein next to where his tumor was removed. Not 100% sure it is recurrence, but they think it is. He was supposed to start radiation two weeks ago, but just before that he started the blood in stool. At one point he had to be infused with two units of blood. He has now had an endoscopy, 2 colonoscopys, and an endoscopy done with the camera pill you swallow. All have come back negative. Everything looks good. So, where could the blood be coming from? Can it be related to the small spot they see around the vein? What other possible cause could there be for the bleeding. The uncertainty and unknowing is unnerving. We want to know where the blood is coming from. Any ideas?","Doctor":"Hello,Since all the tests you mention have been negative it is most likely coming from somewhere in the small intestine. The best test to detect bleeding like that is a nuclear medicine bleeding scan. It can find the source of bleeding in most cases.Regards"},{"Patient":"I have some red spots on my chest area that have appeared about a few weeks ago.

Possibilties for your condition are allergic rash to some thing you exposed or hair bed infection. If allergic rash then it goes and come. In that case taking anti histamines like cetrizine ( zyrtec ) and applying hydrocortisone cream for local application will be helpful. But if it is on hair bed or it appeared after shaving hair then it can be most likely hair bed infection. In that case washing with warm water and applying povidone iodine or brilliant green will be helpful.Hope this may help you.

The cut is over 2 cms long, uninfected and the sides have remained apart for this time. She has been offered further surgery under a general anaesthetic but really does not want to go down this route after being told there is no guarentee that this will work either. She is fourteen, has been using crutches for this time and not been enjoying life. Her consultant just says come back in 6 weeks when we visit and suggested I take away a crutch, leaving her in agony when she puts weight on the wound. Please can I have any advice?","Doctor":"GreetingsWelcome to Healthcaremagic.Wound remaining open for 5 months is a very long time indeed and i completely understand how much pain you daughter much be feeling .Well here it is important to know here what surgery was done initially so that the underlying problem can be identified which could be causing the wound to remain open . Secondly to really find out if the wound is uninfected you will have to visit you doctor because infected would doesn't necessarily mean lots of pus . As far as the advise of you doctor is concerned to under go a surgery , i say it would be a wise decision because no matter what medication your daughter takes or how clean you keep the wound , the wound will not heal if the ends of the wound have not be approximated . This will quickly start the healing process with very good antibiotics with broad spectrum coverage . She might be reluctant ,but if you counsel her that surgical intervention again has good chances of healing your wound , i am sure she will be ready. After all its going to be under general anesthesia and she wouldn't feel a thing. I hope the answer was helpful . In case you have any further questions feel free to contact in writing . Regards. Dr Talal Hussain."},{"Patient":"Hi. I had a housemate who had this grotty blistery thing all over his feet, which I seem to have caught. I had hoped that when he moved out it would have cleared up, which is not the case. Between the toes, and on the side of my foot I've had several outbreaks, and when the blisters burst it seems to spread. The blisters and sites in general are very itchy. In the last week I had a large one of these blisters develop on the bottom of my foot, and when it burst it has become quite painful and red and seems to be infected. The skin around this area is also very itchy and is painful to walk on. In the last two weeks I have been working in a very dirty workshop, which would include exposure to dust, dirt and chemicals, and since my work boots are old and full of holes it is more than possible that some of this stuff has gotten into my shoes and to the infected site.Now, I'm planning on going to the free university doctor on Monday, because as a student I can't afford to go to one of the emergency weekend docs, so I would like to know if there is anything I can do to reduce swelling or fight infection in the meantime.Thanks muchly :)","Doctor":"Hi there,As you have rightly concluded, we need to deal with the wound infection first, and deal with the blisters later when your university doctor can have a look at it.  What I would recommend right now is some anti-inflammatory tablets like diclofenac or even ibuprofen to help deal with the swelling and pain on walking.  For the infection itself, if you could get your hands on some antibiotic cream like mupirocin or fucidic acid it would be useful to apply it twice a day to help control the infection.  If you are not able to get the antibiotic cream, find yourself some antiseptic cream with chlorhexidine or iodine to just help kill off whatever surface bacteria is there.  Try to clean the wound twice a day with some antiseptic solution to just get rid of any discharge and bacteria that is collecting on the surface.  Keep it as dry and aired-out as you can when you are not at the workshop.Your university doctor would reassess it on Monday and be able to prescribe you oral antibiotics if needed, and further treatment for the blisters itself.Hope this helps.Regards,Dr. Teh"},{"Patient":"Hello I have know for over 20 yrs i have had hsv that cause cold sores.

Control of sores with anti-viral agent like aciclovir is very effective.Hope this information will helpWish you good health"},{"Patient":"k..here it goes. A little over a month ago.I. had sex with a friend of mine that was staying with me from out of town. Have known the girl for a while. It was unprotected. Then on may 20th. I had unprotected sex with another friend at her bday party.again have known the girl for years. A few weeks later I was having diaherra and was a little tired. I had also recently started a new job and was working a lot of hours, for sometime 6 or 7 days in a row. Like a dumbass I went online to start researching and came across HIV. I went to the dr and they told me it was nothing. Last Sunday I decided to take one of the home access hiv tests whichis approved by the FDA..etc...on that Monday while I was waiting on the results..I noticed three nasty marks. On on my leg.one on my inner thigh opposite leg.and one on my chest..it was like a shot gun blast to the gut...lesions? I rushed to the ER..where the dr told me they were bug bites. The next day the results from the at home test came back negative. Since then I've still been a nervous wreck..I've notice dry skin on my hands and feet..which I don't know if its flaky skin\\" or what. There are what looks to be acne around my mouth and my throat which I had previously dismissed as acne or razor burn. Ii think my left armpit may be swollen..I don't know...and todya I have noticed really tiny red or purple dots.. in a couple. Places/on my body..I'm gonna take another test in a few weeks.","Doctor":"Short answer: No choice but to wait and retestLong answer:Hi there,From your query, I gather that you are worried more about whether you have contracted HIV from your two unprotected encounters, than you are about the various symptoms that you have described.  However, since you have mentioned it, I will provide some simple solutions.  The bug bites can be managed with a simple hydrocortisone cream to bring down the swelling and discomfort.  Acne is common in areas you mentioned, and is usually managed with topical creams like benzoyl peroxide.  If you are unsure as to whether there is a swelling in your armpit, you should show it to your regular doctor, as it could be a sign of other infections.Regarding the HIV per se, as you may have learned, HIV seroconversion is very vague and non-specific, and we usually do not proceed with extra steps other than to caution you on avoiding further sexual contact while waiting for the testing.  You should be pretty safe if your HIV test was done at least a month after your last encounter.  Be sure to repeat one last test 3 months from your last exposure risk to ensure the accuracy of even the oldest testing methods.I would advise you to refrain from any sexual encounters until the final test, and stress the need for responsible safe sex in the future.  There are many other sexually transmitted diseases that you need to protect yourself from, like the far more common chlamydia and gonorrhea.Hope this helps.  Let me know if you have further questions.Regards,Dr. Teh"},{"Patient":"Hi, I'm 38 yrs old.I have a very itchy clit and sometimes the labia too.There is no abnormal discharge nor smell.

If it was as a result of the cat scratch, it would have appeared within 1-2 weeks.The current medication you are on, Supraben 500g, if the contents of it were available, it would be more helpful.Right now I can think of the following possibilities:1. A sprain in the right leg - either in near the knee or ankle, which was caused by an injury subtle enough for you to have not noticed it.2. An abnormality of the bone - infection or any malignancy (unlikely if you are more than 30yrs of age) 3. An infection of the skin or cellulitis - likely if you have had any injury or even without an injury especially if you have diabetes, with uncontrolled sugars.4. Varicose veins - if your job involves prolonged standing or are very overweight or have any other condition affecting the valves of the veins of the legs.You need thorough examination of the leg and blood tests like a complete blood count, an HbA1c, random blood sugars - mainly in addition to other usual tests that your doctor may ask for.In addition to this, a venous doppler or ultrasound of the leg and Xray if necessary may be required.Hope this helps.

Rash on the skin is commonly associated with an infection or allergy but before I come to my results I need to see photos and if is possible the lab test results in photos. The bright orange urine could be due to highly concentrated urine most probably because your son was not consuming too much fluids recently or losing fluids with sweating.

I am having some what seem to be Petechiae on my right leg now, and sometimes they are darker than others, seem larger or smaller, etc. They've been worrying me, and I've not had other symptoms, until recently, when I got a slight cough with phlegm and slight hard stool and light rectal bleeding. I'm worried they could be the start of something bad! What do you think?","Doctor":"Hello.Thanks for writing to HCM.Petechiae especially extensive ones like you describe, indicate some dysfunction of the platelets. Platelets in the blood help in stopping bleeding, alongwith other factors. Your rectal bleeding may directly be a result of this while your cough may or may not indicate bleeding into the lungs. A complete blood count will demonstrate your platelet count as well as the WBC count.If you are not experiencing fever or swelling of the glands, it is unlikely that you have any infection like dengue which causes drop in platelets. We then have to think of other causes - most of which are liver disorders or spleen disorders.Liver disorders like cirrhosis of the liver due to any cause, decrease the platelets. Confirmation will be by a liver function tests and an ultrasound of the liver.Spleen disorders like ITP may sometimes cause such extensive bleeding manifestations, even though generally they just cause asymptomatic drop in the platelet count. Confirmation is by exclusion of other causes. An abdominal ultrasound may show an enlarged spleen.You need early investigation for this as it indeed may cause serious bleeding if left untreated.

Unable to find in local directory nor remember name.","Doctor":"Hello.Welcome to HCM.The treatment of ulcers is generally by regular cleaning and dressing the ulcer and removal of any dead tissue if present. Antibiotics may be given if the ulcer is infected.However, treatment of the cause is more important.The most common causes which I have seen in my practice are1. Improper and ill-fitting footwear - Try to wear more comfortable ones.2. Varicose veins - cause ulcers mostly near the inner side of foot. 3. Diabetes - diabetes by itself does not cause ulcers but increases the chances of developing them by decreasing the sensations over the skin. These ulcers take a long time to heal, hence early treatment is important.Apart from these common causes there are other causes affecting the arteries and veins which may cause ulcers.Diagnosis is helped by clinical examination, history and by tests like Doppler of the legs.Since you have not mentioned the other conditions you have or the duration of the ulcers, I have given a generalised overview for you. However, I am afraid I cannot help you with the medical supply stores in your area.Wishing you good health.Regards,Dr Geeta"},{"Patient":"Hi, Last year I had the TB skin Test done and tested positive, but since my chest xrays were fine, the Dr. said it was surely latent TB. I didn't question it at the moment, so went on the INH treatment for 8 months. After finishing my treatment, I kept wondering how could I ensure that I no longer had TB, so I asked my Dr. that I wanted to take a blood test to see if I was now \\"cured\\". He said that once I was tested positive, I would always continue testing positive, regardless of the INH treatment, but after several times of me insisting, he agreed to do the QuantiERON gold blood test for me. The results came back and they were negative. Since he won't clarify, my question is, does this mean I never really had latent TB and was a \\"False Positive\\" in the beginning, or, the possibility of me being \\"cured\\" after the treatment exists? Thanks so much in advance.","Doctor":"Hello.I can understand your concern. The Mantoux or the TB skin test is mainly done to ascertain whether you were exposed to or infected by the TB bacteria. The infection may be anywhere in the body, the reaction of the body can be seen on the skin area where the Mantoux test solution is injected. It does not mean you have skin TB.Since your chest Xray was clear, I assume you had TB of some other organ (TB can affect almost any organ in the body). This is called extra-pulmonary TB.In some countries where TB is not endemic i.e. commonly found, treatment is given based on the Mantoux test. In countries where TB is commonly found, many people may test positive for Mantoux since they may be exposed to the bacteria. Most of the times, if immunity is good, the TB bacteria cause a small infection of the lungs or elsewhere which gets controlled by the body. The bacteria then sometimes continue to lie there dormant, causing what is caled latent TB. Again, latent TB is sometimes treated, sometimes not, according to the local guideines.I assume you had a condition which tested negative for all the common causes in your place, hence the TB skin test was done as a last measure. Since it was positive, it was assumed that this TB infection was the cause of your current symptoms and hence was treated. With treatmnet, you will test negative for TB bacteria.Hope this helps.

You seem to have been started on AKT 4 on the suspicion that you have/ had genital tuberculosis. But, it is a bit confusing here - if at all you have been carrying tuberculosis for 12 yrs without treatment it would've had spread to different places and been much more severe by now.However, if it is genital tuberculosis indeed, taking AKT-4 will definitely help in normal conception, if both your fallopian tubes are patent and ovaries are working fine. This is because, tuberculosis is known to cause blocked tubes and unfavorable changes in the lining of the uterus.If there are any changes in the reproductive organs i.e. ovaries, fallopian tubes or the uterus, I am afraid you may have to go for IVF again.Your gynaecologist must have already checked the patency of the fallopian tubes i.e. they should be hollow. If at all they aren't, options are IVF or surgical reconstruction (with very less chances of success).Hope this helps.Regards,Dr Geeta"},{"Patient":"Hi, last weekend i got two pimples on my upper arm that were very itchy, so i started to pick them and intill they bled and got bigger.

These glands secrete fluid that helps lubricate the vagina.Sometimes the openings of these glands become obstructed, causing fluid to back up into the gland. The result is relatively painless swelling called a Bartholin's cyst. If the fluid within the cyst becomes infected, you may develop a collection of pus surrounded by inflamed tissue (abscess).This is exact what happened to you.When obstructed(cyst) or infected(abscess) the best treatment is marsupialisation.After this act, antibiotic may help prevent further evolution of infection.However, the germ in cause may be resistant to the antibiotic given.This may explain the poor response you had on treatment.I will suggest you see the Doctor for a pus culture and antibiotic sensitivity test.From the results, a more objective antibiotherapy may be prescribes.You will also have to see the Hospital for regular drainage and dressing.Hope this will helpBest regards"},{"Patient":"Hi, may I answer your health queries right now ?

It is important to complete the entire course of the treatment.Tuberculosis can affect the lining of the uterus, damaging it, or can cause adhesions that lead to blockage of the fallopian tubes which cannot be reversed. If the TB is diagnosed at an early stage and the infection is treated, the damage to the uterus or fallopian tubes may heal completely.The Anti Kochs treatment (AKT) is given in two phases. In the first phase (active phase) of the treatment AKT4 (Isoniazide, Rifampicin, Pyrazinamide & Ethambutol) is given for 2 months. This is followed by administration of AKT2 (Isoniazide & Rifampicin) for 4 months in case of 6 months regimen. After the first two months of treatment) you can start planning for a baby. After the course is completed, you can go for a laparoscopy & hysteroscopy to know whether the uterus, fallopian tubes & ovaries are normal or not. Also, your husband's semen analysis should be done simultaneously, your hormonal tests which include FSH, LH, TSH, Prolactin, OGTT & Pelvic ultrasound scan should be done if your cycles are not regular.

I was admitted and treated with antibiotic injection for eight days followed by a oral course of seven days. After one month i was feeling tired and a pain in left side rib portion. I consulted a doctor and gone for USG and found a enlarged spleen as well as lever. Doctor insist me to take rest and this is due to your previous Typhoid. Still I am suffering from pain in my left back rib side. I want to know that how much time is required to cure spleen enlargement and also want know whether required a treatment.","Doctor":"Enlargement resolves on successful treatment of causative disorder. You have been successfully treated for typhoid, so there is no need to worry. Regression of enlargement spleen occurs slowly after clearance of infection. Sometimes it takes long time for complete resolution of enlarged. Advice 1.     Ibuprofen 600 mg per oral after meal if pain in intolerable. Otherwise avoid it2.     Take bed rest for few weeks3.     Avoid strenuous physical activity as strenuous work can cause rupture of enlarged spleen which is a life-threatening condition4.     Have patience and eat high protein diet such as egg yolk, fruits, meat and cheeseI hope this information will help you.

Since then he has developed swollen red splotchy ankles that hurt quite a bit. It seems the more he is on them the worse the pain is for him.  The splotches are on the top of the feet, ankles and run about 6 inches above the ankle. The left is definitely worse than the right one.  He is not overweight and is a manual laborer so used to that kind of work.  He seems to think he got some weird kind of athletes foot, but I haven't seen athletes foot like that before.  He also has lumps under the skin that feel for lack of a better word, knots and they are between the top of the foot and ankles. To me it looks like a bad case of hives.

Allergic and irritant contact dermatitis.The symptoms of allergic contact dermatitis include:1. dry, scaly, flaky skin2. hives3. oozing or dry blisters4. skin redness5. skin that appears darkened or leathery6. skin that burns with or without sores7. extreme itching8. sun sensitivity9. swelling, especially in the eyes, face, or groin areasIrritant contact dermatitis may cause slightly different symptoms, such as:1. blistering2. cracking skin due to extreme dryness3. swelling4. skin that feels stiff or tightened5. ulcerations6. open sores that form crustsTreatmentAvoid scratching your irritated skin if you think you may be experiencing contact dermatitis. Scratching can make the irritation worse or even cause a skin infection that requires antibiotics. Instead, clean your skin with soap and lukewarm water to remove any irritants. One way to soothe the rash is to mix two tablespoons of baking soda in cool water. Soak a washcloth in the cool water, wring it out, and apply it to the skin. Other anti-itch treatments include calamine lotion or hydrocortisone cream. You can purchase these items at most drugstores. Your doctor can prescribe a more potent steroid cream if these creams don’t soothe your skin.Taking an antihistamine drug such as diphenhydramine can help to cut down on itching and reduce your allergic response.Avoid scratching your irritated skin if you think you may be experiencing contact dermatitis.

Your general practitioner thought your falls were due to ataxia and hence referred you to a neurologist.Since, your neurological tests were normal and there were no abnormalities in the brain like a blood clot or tumor in the cerebellum part, the next cause to be ruled out was syncope due to any heart issue. Hence your neurologist referred you to a cardiologist.Syncope is temporary loss of consciousness which may be caused by temporary decrease in the blood supply to the brain. This might be the cause of your falls. Heart issues like inadequate pumping or irregular heart beat may cause syncope. The pericardial effusion on echocardiogram suggests that you have some fluid in the space between your heart and its covering i.e. pericardium. This fluid if sufficiently large in quantity may compress the heart and prevent enough blood from filling inside it. It may also be the cause of your syncope. However, if it was minimal fluid, it causes no symptoms.The tilt table test is done to basically reproduce the symptoms of syncope while continuously monitoring your heart beat and blood pressure and other vital signs. It was positive in your case as it caused syncope i.e. decreased the blood supply to your brain for a short time - which caused the dizziness and near loss of consciousness. The tightness in the chest is also a symptom of decrease in the blood supply to your heart. Your cardiologist must have deduced that something similar might have happened which caused your falls i.e. your blood pressure must have been below that which is needed for blood to reach your brain especially when you stand up (this is called orthostatic hypotension). Hence, he changed your BP or heart medication from toprol xl (metoprolol) to pindolol to reduce the variation in BP. The new medication might cause lesser reduction in BP so that the brain will get enough blood supply.This new medication should not cause any adverse effects so you need not worry.Hope I have cleared your doubts. Wishing you good health.Regards,Dr Geeta"},{"Patient":"My 27year-old daughter has what appears to be coxsackie virus.  It starts 8 days ago.

She has been running a fever.  For the last couple days it has fluctuated from normal to mid-99s.

Yesterday I got a another small scratch from her on my neck . I got her treated for foam vomiting and direa then she was fine. But I never got her vaccinated until yesterday. Then I let her go. Are there any chances of me getting rabies. Last week I got a mild  swelling in my tongue my left eye had also swollen up even my right eye was starting to swell up. I went and took a tettinis injection and showed my eyes to a eye doctor. Now the swelling in tongue is gone. The swelling in my eyes are also much better. Today I took one vaccination against rabies. The particulars of the bill say that I took one VAXIRAB amount-338.00 and INJ.GIVING CHARGE amount-5.00. I plan to complete the remaining three doses that they have sheduled for me they are on 11, 14 and 21 of may. Please I just want to know wheter I am safe. Are these vaccinations safe and sufficient for me.","Doctor":"Hello.I can understand your concern. The incubation period of Rabies in humans i.e. the time taken from the virus to enter the body and produce symptoms can vary from anywhere between 1 week to 3-4 weeks. The same incubation period in cats is lesser i.e. from 1 day to a couple of weeks. Once the virus enters the body, the disease progression is very fast and death may occur within 10 days to 2 weeks. Since you have been scratched by your unimmunised pet over a period of 4 months, it rules out rabies infection in your cat as she did not show any symptoms during this period like aggressiveness or decreased activity. Another very common symptom of rabies is hydrophobia i.e. fear of water which from the information you provided, was absent. Hence, the chances of your cat transmitting the infection to you is also ruled out.Rabies virus mainly affects the nervous system and initial symptoms include pain at the bite site, generalised muscle aches, etc. which may rapidly progress to serious symptoms like change in behaviour, aggressiveness, mental changes, hydrophobia, fear of light and eventually death. It is not known to cause swelling of eyes or tongue.Since you have already started the vaccination schedule for rabies, you can complete the entire course to be on the safer side. Rabies vaccinations are generally safe and sufficient for superficial scratches or bites. In case there is bleeding at the bite site, rabies immunoglobulins are generally given alongwith the vaccines.Hope this helps.Regards,Dr Geeta"},{"Patient":"I am suffering from bone TB with infection and inflammation in my left sacral bone. The diagnosis was done after open biopsy. Therapy: Taking antibiotics from last two months. Started with Rifampicin, Isonizid, Pyrazinamide and Ethambutol. As the organism was found as fully sensitive/susceptible, Ethambutol was stopped after two weeks and the therapy continued with three medicines mentioned above. As, I have completed two months, now the plan is continue with Rifampicin and Isoniazid and stop Pyrazinamide. Observation: I felt a lot of improvement in the first two weeks of treatment but the condition detoriated rapidly after discontinuation of Ehambutol. Pain retuned back and much higher this time. However, new MRI and CT scan showed that the infection was not spreading. So, I was advised that the TB therapy is correct and I should continue with the three antibiotics. Now after completing two months of therapy, I am still in pain and way behind the improvment I was noticing after first two weeks of treatment. Bone abscess: Abscess is formed at the infection site, which is supposed to be treated by the immune system of my body and no external interference is done. Nerve involvement: I have severe pain and weakness in my left leg due to the pressure on the nerve roots caused by the inflammation at the infection site (left saclral bone). I took a lot of pain killers and was on a steroid (prednisone) course also for 20 days but pain and weakness returned back once I stopped taking the steroid. Can you please tell me whether the TB therapy is correct and how long will it take to get relief from pain? Also, how long the bone inflammation will last so that my nerve can get a relief and my left leg will feel better? Thanks a zillion in advance.","Doctor":"Hello.I appreciate the way you have explained your symptoms in detail, it is very helpful for a physician.The regimen for TB of the bone (which comes under extrapulmonary TB) is 2 months of Isonizid, Rifampicin, Pyrazinamide and Ethambutol. This is called the Intensive phase. This is later followed by the maintainence phase of 4 months of Isonizid and Rifampicin only. Total duration of therapy is 6 months. This is the regimen recommended by WHO in DOTS and is also followed in India where TB is very prevalent. We have observed very good results with this regimen in patients with bone TB.Though Ethambutol has side effects affecting the vision, we donot generally stop it only after 2 weeks. Even though it does not kill the TB bacteria but only stops it from multiplying, it is considered an important drug. Since it was stopped for you, I presume that it was according to the guidelines which are followed in your country. Generally, it would not be significant, but in the light of reappearance of your symptoms, I would consider it significant.Abscess which is formed due to TB bacteria is called a cold abscess as it does not have any active inflammation. It will gradually disappear with the same treatment. Surgical intervention like drainage is associated with other effects like formation of a sinus at the drainage site and non healing ulcer. Hence, it is not generally attempted if the abscess is small and is not causing any pressure symptoms. If your abscess is quite big in size it might be another reason for the pain as it might be pinching on the nerve fibres as they come out of the spinal canal. In this case it might need surgical drainage. TB also erodes the bone and causes it to collapse upon itself - which may also cause the trapping of the nerves. Surgery becomes the only definitive treatment in this case. Since the new MRI and CT did not show any nerve trapping and bone collapse, we can rule this out.Apart from this at present I would advice continuation of the TB therapy and an additional one month of intensive phase of the 4 drugs. Since the organism is susceptible, it may prove to be very helpful. You may again have to continue the short course of steroids for a period of atleast 2 weeks for control of inflammation till then. Please consult your physician for the same.Hope this helps.Regards,Dr Geeta"},{"Patient":"Hello Doc s...I have normal blood pressure here at home, 125/90 (i guess) but my pulse is 138.
