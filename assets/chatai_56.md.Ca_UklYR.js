Visit ER and get blood tests done to see the RA factor and advancement of arthritis. You may need a surgical intervention. To help alleviate pain and to reduce inflammation, you may need injections, eg., Lidocaine local anesthetic along with some anti inflammatory medication.

Gastroenteritis is usually accompanied by these symptoms, but if the symptoms continue for more than 4 days and you haven't taken probiotics and oral rehydration solutions you should go to the ER for IV therapy and further treatment.

Lower back pain is quite COMMON among middle aged individuals. Back muscle strain is one of the MOST common causes of acute to severe lower back pain. Lifting a heavy object, twisting, or a sudden movement can cause muscles or ligaments stretch or develop microscopic tears. Some other underlying causes like Sciatica, Spondylitis, Lumbar herniated disc, Degenerative disc disease, Isthmic spondylolisthesis etc should be ruled out through clinical examination and radiological investigation (like X- ray, CT scan, Myelogram, MRI etc). Kindly, consult with Orthopedic surgeon regarding this for proper management of the case. TREATMENT: Some general guidelines can help you to reduce lower back pain. These are as follows: 1) Take adequate bed REST with maintaining posture. Individuals who do not regularly exercise to build strength and flexibility are more likely to experience recurrent or prolonged lower back pain. 2) Alternate Hot water bottle or Ice pack can help to relieve most types of low back pain by reducing inflammation. 3) Non-Steroid Anti-Inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs) are quite useful to reduce inflammation and back pain. You need proper prescription from your doctor. 4) Exercise for Lower Back Pain : It is a key element of almost any lower back pain treatment plan. You may contact with Physiotherapist regarding this. It includes 3 components: aerobic conditioning, stretching, and strengthening. The exercises are done through a controlled, progressive program to build more strong and flexible spine. 5) Epidural Steroid Injections - deliver steroids directly into the painful area of the lower back to reduce inflammation. It doesn't heal the components of the back, but often provide enough pain relief to allow patients to move, exercise and heal. Hope I have answered your query.

Lower back pain is quite COMMON among middle aged individuals. Back muscle strain is one of the MOST common causes of acute to severe lower back pain. Lifting a heavy object, twisting, or a sudden movement can cause muscles or ligaments stretch or develop microscopic tears. Some other underlying causes like Sciatica, Spondylitis, Lumbar herniated disc, Degenerative disc disease, Isthmic spondylolisthesis etc should be ruled out through clinical examination and radiological investigation (like X- ray, CT scan, Myelogram, MRI etc).

I still continue to have back pain . what can I do?","Doctor":"Hello and Welcome to ‘Ask A Doctor’ service. I have reviewed your query and here is my advice. Scoliosis is better diagnosed in weight bearing position or functional position since it becomes apparent only while standing. Mild varieties or those without bony deformities tens to disappear on lying down. So for assessment of scoliosis it is standard practice to do x rays in standing position. After back surgeries sometimes the problem is muscle imbalance or change of bony alignment leading to scoliosis. Back pain associated with scoliosis is generally due to muscular imbalance and needs muscle imbalance correction by adequate and related physiotherapy. Sometimes support in the form of braces is also required. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further."},{"Patient":"Hi, I've been experiencing a tingling on my back.

Lower back pain is quite common among middle aged individuals. Back muscle strain is one of the most common causes of acute to severe lower back pain. Lifting a heavy object, twisting, or a sudden movement can cause muscles or ligaments stretch or develop microscopic tears. Some other underlying causes like sciatica, spondylitis, Lumbar herniated disc, degenerative disc disease, isthmic spondylolisthesis, etc., should be ruled out through clinical examination and radiological investigation (like X- ray, CT scan, Myelogram, MRI, etc). Kindly, consult with Orthopedic surgeon regarding this for proper management of the case. Treatment: Some general guidelines can help you to reduce lower back pain. These are as follows: 1) Take adequate bed rest with maintaining posture. Individuals who do not regularly exercise to build strength and flexibility are more likely to experience recurrent or prolonged lower back pain. 2) Alternate hot water bottle or ice pack can help to relieve most types of low back pain by reducing inflammation. 3) Non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are quite useful to reduce inflammation and back pain. You need proper prescription from your doctor. 4) Exercise for lower back pain: It is a key element of almost any lower back pain treatment plan. You may contact with Physiotherapist regarding this. It includes 3 components: aerobic conditioning, stretching, and strengthening. The exercises are done through a controlled, progressive program to build more strong and flexible spine. 5) Epidural steroid injections - deliver steroids directly into the painful area of the lower back to reduce inflammation.

Lower back pain is quite COMMON among middle aged individuals. Back muscle strain is one of the MOST common causes of acute to severe lower back pain. Lifting a heavy object, twisting, or a sudden movement can cause muscles or ligaments stretch or develop microscopic tears. Some other underlying causes like Sciatica, Spondylitis, Lumbar herniated disc, Degenerative disc disease, Isthmic spondylolisthesis etc should be ruled out through clinical examination and radiological investigation (like X- ray, CT scan, Myelogram, MRI etc). Kindly, consult with Orthopedic surgeon regarding this for proper management of the case. TREATMENT: Some general guidelines can help you to reduce lower back pain. These are as follows: 1) Take adequate bed REST with maintaining posture. Individuals who do not regularly exercise to build strength and flexibility are more likely to experience recurrent or prolonged lower back pain. 2) Alternate Hot water bottle or Ice pack can help to relieve most types of low back pain by reducing inflammation. 3) Non-Steroid Anti-Inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs) are quite useful to reduce inflammation and back pain. You need proper prescription from your doctor. 4) Exercise for Lower Back Pain : It is a key element of almost any lower back pain treatment plan. You may contact with Physiotherapist regarding this. It includes 3 components: aerobic conditioning, stretching, and strengthening. The exercises are done through a controlled, progressive program to build more strong and flexible spine. 5) Epidural Steroid Injections - deliver steroids directly into the painful area of the lower back to reduce inflammation.

I have been a very ill women, 63 yrs old and just recently moved to Southwest Mo with my husband, as he cant let me be alone. So we moved here to retire and i have been disabled since 2005. I have so many pain issues and have been being treated by a very caring and smart Dr. of Pain Management. I can not get any medical help here, where we moved to. Yes, i am on opiates, and i take them as directed on the bottle. I do not abuse my meds, one bit. I am hearing that, if you take opiates, your an addict. That is so wrong, if i am a addict, so be it. I refused to live in pain as i was terribly in, in 2004 & 2005. It took years to get me on a pain regiment that actually let me live some quality of life. I was bed ridden for years afraid to even take any kind of pill, I just couldn t take the pain I suffered with any longer. So, with much discussion with my husband, my Primary Care Dr said i should see a pain management Dr and see if he could help me with the terrible pain i was having. I was already in terrible back pain from a bad fall i had at 44 yrs old. I have herniated and bulging discs in my lower back. I cant even compare it to labor pain i had with my three children. I had natural child birth. I didn t want to affect my babies with any medication for pain, so i refused any help for the pain. But to live with that pain every day, is so depressing and no will to live. I was young and full of life, now i am 63 and with my TWO pain meds, One ER and the other break thru pain. any other meds that they felt would help me, i said, if this does t help me, then thought of surgery for the back. NO,one would touch me, because they couldn t tell me it would work, and to be ridden of pain. NO, we cant promise you that. In fact, they said it could be worse then it was already. Just couldn t even think what that would be like. Then i fell at age 50, at Graceland, and broke my leg. I was casted till i recovered. Then I had to have knee surgery due to a torn meniscus. After 4 months of therapy I was still in horrible pain. I went to 9 Ortho Specialists in San Diego, after every one of them said i had RSD. What the heck is that? I asked. If your a Dr. you should know what that is, then my husband wrote a letter to the Surgeon General of the United States, asking why i couldn t be seen at Naval Hospital San Diego,? As he is a retired Navy Chief for 22 yrs. A letter came and authorized me to see the TWO Ortho Specialist, thinking they wouldn t be covering a mishap during the knee surgery. After them seeing me on many appointments, they both came in the room and diagnosed me with RCPD I guess it wasn t all in my head. Well hello, I have better things to do then see Dr s the rest of my life. So, now to this day i am writing to you wondering what i am going to do, the rest of my life? Yes, my pain is real, and its bad. Why wouldn t i not want to take a pill to alive ate the pain i have every minute of the day. My meds help me, I just cant understand why we pain sufferers have to be punished due to people that don t value their lives. I value mine, and i take what helps me feel less pain, so that i can have some quality of life. Why would anyone with a heart want to take that away from a person. I have had MRI s Scans, X-Rays, you name it, I have had it done. It doesn t stop there, I have of late, been diagnosed with Fibro pain, and rheumatoid arthritis in my right hand, Broke my left foot last year, and have now got the RCPD in my left foot. All i want from a Dr here in Southwestern MO to help me not be in pain. It doesn t have to even be opiates but something for pain that will help me? Please reply what i am supposed to do? Please answer my plea, Would you want to be in pain everyday? I would think not. I hope you wouldn t. Can you help me or not? It seems moving here was a big mistake. As it was the last thing I was even worrying about. But, guess what, No Dr will help me here. What do I do?? I need medical help and cant even get it. I know for a fact if i run out of the two meds i take, things will be horrible as like any medication to quit cold turkey, could kill me. Do those deaths warrant a percentage as well? Probably not. I cant even go to a emergency room, without being labeled. Who will believe me? I am new to the area and moving from the west coast, what would you do, if i was your patient, and i came to your ER. Thank you for listening, the president just said on TV that I should be able to retain my previous illnesses. I believe this is ONE.

All of this treatment followed. Pain has changed to radiating thru buttock and leg down to ankle. Also spot on lower back feels spongy like gel filling, unstable. Throughout recovery have done gentle stretching physio at home recommended for lower back pain. I am presently scheduled to see Orthopedic Dr. On Wednesday. Questions: 1. what is most likely trouble, pinched nerve, slipped disc, or other? Can this be a result of muscle spasm only? 2. do you think MRI likely? 3. Any MRI necessary, what treatment might help alleviate pain in meantime?","Doctor":"Hello and Welcome to ‘Ask A Doctor’ service. I have reviewed your query and here is my advice.

It was difficult to breathe (due to pain) and hurt worse when I take in deep breaths or suck my stomach in. It does not feel like it is muscle as touching, pushing on, and rubbing does not make it worse or better, and it is almost like you can t actually touch where the pain is. The pain feels deep in and hurts inside a lot worse with breathing, sucking in stomach, certain movements – however pain will quit if I bend over and lean forward, or certain ways that I twist or turn.. The worst pain is from laying or sitting and raising up, or sucking my tummy in. Ibuprofen is not very helpful and I am on the third day of feeling like this. I turn at night and am awakened by the pain, which is not getting any better or worse. The pain is way above my kidney area and my heartbeat, and bowel and bladder are all normal with no changes. Appetite is still good, and it does not get any better or worse with eating or drinking. I am just concerned because I have no idea what it could possibly be - no injury or use of my back to make the pain start. I literally was standing at a counter sprinkling cheese on a plate when it hit.","Doctor":"Hello and Welcome to ‘Ask A Doctor’ service. I have reviewed your query and here is my advice.

Each time I try to straighten my body up to stand, it grabs me again with a very sharp pain right across my upper back and I struggle to breathe . After 2/3/4 minutes it starts to subside and goes away. It comes out of the blue from nowhere at all. It happens every few days or so but I just can t work out what triggers it. It feels like my whole mid section is paralysed for a very short period. In 2003 I fell 20feet down concrete stairs and landed on the floor with my body at right angles to my legs - I was hospitalised for a week with what was initially believed to be a broken back but was ultimately diagnosed as muscular damage ( I was super fit physically at this time ). I then got lower back pain, worsening consistently and 5 years later in 2008 I got up to get ready to go to work one morning and collapsed in s heap on the floor and couldn t get up. I had emergency surgery on my back and was told that my L1-5 had been crushed and the substance from inside the discs had migrated into my spinal cord canal and had actually touched the cord and I was very lucky to undergo surgery so promptly. It took me 4 years to walk properly again and I now get bladder problems ( leakage ) and occasional period of not being able to move well. I wear a fentanyl pain patch . I m wondering if this is connected in any way ? I apologise for the length of this but I needed to paint a fuller picture for you . Jacqui","Doctor":"Hello and Welcome to ‘Ask A Doctor’ service.

Getting pain in your back and thighs is most likely due to disc problems (disc prolapse). The sciatic nerve, which gives nerve supply to your leg starts from your lower back and descends to your back of the thigh. Feeling back pain associated with thigh pain means that something happens at the root of the sciatic nerve and the pain in your thighs is just radiating pain. You should perform MRI on your lumber rejoin of your back (lower back) and to be assessed for the grade of that bulging. Analgesics are temporary but not cure. You may need physiotherapy on your back or surgical repair of the bulged disc. Whatever happens, it is not that danger thing to worry about but you have to visit your doctor soon.

Hot pack and sesame oil massage on your back before bedtime give you relief from pain. In case your pain is constant your problem can be most likely due to urinary stones.

I am Dr Shareef answering your query. If I were your doctor, I would after an initial clinical examination would advise you for an ultrasound abdomen to rule out a gall stone disease and if positive, would advise you for a definitive treatment (cholecystectomy) which would give you a cure.

Till then, you could go for an anti spasmodic drug for a symptomatic relief.I hope this information would help you in discussing with your family physician/treating doctor in further management of your problem.

I was about to write a note to him tonight as I continue to have chronic back pain following 3 back surgeries over the past approx 10 years. I have been to pain management clinics and do all I can at home with exercises, stretching, etc but have been fairly successfully treated with Oxycodone 20 mg, 2 tabs, tid (by Dr. H) for the past several years. We have a pretty good relationship regarding this, however I know he is very watchful and must be careful regarding the prescribing of opioids. The difficult part for me is that some months the prescription is enough to control the pain and other months, depending on activity - it is not enough. I honestly don t feel I have side effects after being on the meds as long as I have and infact, if the pain is controlled I am so fortunate to be able to do the things I love, i. e garden and travel and hold my grand children!! Its a bit depressing not to be able to live a full life when the pain is not controlled, especially because I am lucky to be healthy in every other way. I m always embarrassed if I have to tell my physician I ve run low on the medication and it puts him in a tough spot prescribing meds sooner than scheduled. I do not above the meds. I m careful with the timing of them and am quite aware of the risks involved. Basically, some months are just much easier than others.

Some occur to me today this may not be a disc problem but a kidney problem.","Doctor":"back pain is a common symptom in middle and older age population. there are various pain producing structures in the lower back. although i do not know  know your age , the fact that the pain is more while turning in bed indicates a spinal instability pain pattern.

Hence I would suggest you to atleast have a discussion with you Physician and after clearance, you can consider neurotin.

It s the lower right side. It does not go down in the my legs it s just isolated to my back. I have no nausea or no blood in my urine. Any idea on what it could be?","Doctor":"Hello! Welcome to HealthcareMagic! Lower back pain may cause by right lumber disc prolapse which compresses the nerve. but exact other causes are diagnosed by physical examination or by MRI. Common causes of lower backache and leg pain is a lumbar ruptured disc or herniated disc. Symptoms of a herniated disc may include dull or sharp pain, muscle spasm or cramping, sciatica, and leg weakness or loss of leg function. Sneezing, coughing, or bending usually intensify the pain.Rarely bowel or bladder control is lost, and if this occurs, seek medical attention at once.Sciatica is a symptom frequently associated with a lumbar herniated disc. Pressure on one or several nerves that contribute to the sciatic nerve can cause pain, burning, tingling, and numbness that extends from the buttock into the leg and sometimes into the foot. Usually one side (left or right) is affected.

Li and l-2 in 2009 and l-3, l-4 amd l-5 in 2011. Back never recovered after 2nd surgery. As I stand up my back loclks up and feels like bone on bone scraping. The pain is intense and makes it hard too breathe. Both SI joint areas hurt as it alternates from one side to the other with the right side being the constant area where I get hip flare ups, pain down leg and down to my big toe. I have had multiple MRI s and at one toime in 2014 was told by surgeon I needed surgery as the disk was chipping on opposite side of where he had performed prior surgery. He decided as I waired for wifes insurance to kick in and he changed his mind. I went to new surgeon in the same office and he saw nothing on the same MRI that showed a problem in 2014 and didn t think the current MRI warranted surgery. The pain is incredible about 5-7 months out of the year and not so bad the rest of the time though I am on opiates for pain and they help keep the pain to a dull roar during the better months. Nothing helps much when I have the stabbng sensations like I am feeling at the present time. There seems to be no particular thing that sets it off. I had been seeing a pain dr up until the first surgery and even for 2 years after the second surgery. Trigger point shots stopped helping at all. Is there any type of surgery, such as cageing mt lower vertabre, which would help or will this continue to get worse as time goes by? Setting upright seems to put a lot of pressure on lower back and exacerbates the problem.","Doctor":"Hello! Welcome to HCM! I have studied your case.You may need to do MRI spine again with contrast to see for nerve compression.

The symptoms you have mentioned may be seen with a systemic or local cause that causes the muscles to contract. This can be seen when toxins in the area are affecting the muscles and causing them to remain tetanised. Also, one may notice that the catch in the muscle persists for some time.

Acid reflux (GERD).Upper Back Pain Treatments:-Pain relievers and anti-inflammatory medications may temporarily reduce pain and inflammation, but they do nothing to heal strained muscles or malfunctioning joints. They wear off after a few hours and the pain returns. Meanwhile, they’re interacting with other medications you may take and creating unwanted side effects!Moderate exercise is certainly beneficial in helping prevent back pain; however, once the pain is present, that’s a sign that something’s not right. Exercising strained areas puts further stress on the muscles and joints, creating additional nerve irritation and potentially worsening the underlying problem.Trigger point injections are shots of local anesthetic such as Lidocaine administered directly to areas of acute pain. Like other pain relievers, they simply reduce pain temporarily without addressing the underlying problem.hope this was helpful.have a healthy day."},{"Patient":"hi. my son is 36 yrs old. he has had chronic pain in the lower right side of his abdomen for a few years.

Possible causes are-1. Poor Hip Mobility:-With every step we take our hip and pelvis move in three planes of motion.  If we have any lack of motion in our hip it will cause the spine to move more than it is designed to move.  Overtime this increased motion can begin to create inflammation and compression of the nerves that exit the spine.  This leads to sciatica and lower back pain.2. Limited Foot and Ankle Mobility:-Every time our foot hits the ground when we are walking studies demonstrate that the body needs to absorb 2-3 times our body weight in forces.  Those forces end up traveling up into the spine. If the foot is stiff and does not flatten when we walk like it is designed to do it will cause an increase in forces transmitted into the spine.  The increased forces cause increased compression and can irritate the joints and nerves in the spine.3. Decreased Hip Strength:-It is very common to see people walking with a slight lead to one side when the foot lands on the ground.  This is an indicator that the lateral part of the hip is weak (glute medius).  When this happens, the body compensates by leaning to that side.  When the body leans to that side is causes compression of the nerves on the same side of the spine.4. Stiff Upper Back:-With every step we take we also have an arm swing in the opposite direction. This arm swing causes our upper back to rotate.  If we have limited upper back rotation it will cause increase rotation in the lower back.  This increased rotation can lead to increased compression and irritation to the joints and nerves in the spine.5. Stenosis or Arthritis in the spine:-Research indicates that if you are over 55 years old, have pain in your lower back with walking or standing and it goes away when you sit, there is a 97% chance you have arthritis in your spine. This arthritis predisposes you to have pain with walking in your spine.  If you fix all of the things we have mentioned earlier then you can walk without pain even when you have stenosis or arthritis in the spine.  Don’t let it be an excuse.  Just know it is one of the 5 reasons why your back may hurt when you walk.Hope it was helpful.Stay healthy,Stay safe."},{"Patient":"I was attending Center for Pain control and was discharge for missing 3 appointment..

Area for pain you described falls in lumbar spine ,  the area where surgery is done. pain has occurred after 4 years of surgery so there are many possibilities. first may be infection of the hardware if it's there. second is implant failure or breakage. third may be instability around fused area.

She swings between faecal incontinence to constipation. She also had an op 6 months ago to tighten muscles to help with the incontinence. A few days before the op her back suddenly became very painful but not a pain she was used to, she felt it was more around the kidney area, but accepted it as scoliosis. She then was diagnosed with an abdominal aortic aneuyrism and is being monitored for that. The change in back pain has continued since.She has complained for 10 days now of constipation and has taken huge amounts of Movicol and sennacot. There has been liquid faeces passed but she feels like there is huge blockage and is complaining of extremely uncomfortable bloating, nausea etc. After reading a little about about AAA could the back pain and bloating be symptoms of that?","Doctor":"Hi.Thanks for your query for your Mother. Read the history of multiple problems she is suffering from and tried to correlate all . The pain in abdomen looks to be due to overdose of Sennacot and Movicol. They are known to cause this sort of pain. If she is still feeling of block, this can be due to impacted fecoliths which can be seen on ultrasonography and a Soap-Saline enema may solve her problem.This is probably not due to Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm.

Take one table spoon of castor oil at bed time until you get relief.2. Develop a habit of drinking water in the morning. Start with 2 glasses of water, and increase intake up to 6 - 7 glasses. It is more beneficial if this water can be stored in a copper container overnight.3. Soak 3-4 dried figs after washing them overnight in water. Eat them first thing in the morning, and also drink the water in which they were soaked. They should also be taken in the evening. Try this treatment for 3-4 weeks.4. Apply 3 to 4 drops of lukewarm castor oil over the navel at night in kids. It will help in clearing the bowel movements in kids (of age 1- 3 years) in the morning.5.

I have been on Soma for many years and it seems to be losing effects. I have four discs in my neck whom i saw a surgeon and he did mri s and ct scans. The doctor began doing facet injections on each disc (C-4,5,6 AND 7) every other week. horrible pain. horrible pain. One last time that i was there i was given an MMB and i thought i would DIE on the spot with the pain. So surgery is not gonna be done as I survived a car accident (head on during a seizure and/or anxiety attack). I had a rollover about 14-15 months and i have had a breast reduction hoping that my back would feel better, and it is still in the healing in process but my neck does feel better, My question is this: having been in a rollover as a very young girl (age 8) and then the two other car accidents, how do I find a good pain doctor who won t automatically ASSUME that I am out just finding drugs. I don t drink or do any medications that aren t mine and I don t know how to talk to my new PCP regarding my medications as well so my doctors are all on the same page. That isn t all that simple to get a doctor that will accept you as a patient if you are already on drugs like Soma and also Clonazapam - both that aren t really working, but I feel like the doctor is going right, we will just dispense anything because she want s drugs). I use only one pharmacy here in our town in Perryville, AR and I don t drive for safety of others. How do I approach either my doctor or a pain management doctor about possibly changing medications? I had a doctor for MANY years in Lonoke Arkansas but I divorced and moved to Perryville. If I hadn t totaled two cars out, I would drive myself to the doctors. I was on Medicaid previously, but had to go to the health marketplace for insurance since my disability just began the end of February this year and it is 84.00 a month. So how do I discuss this with a doctor and should I ask my doctor for a referral and possibly removed from the medication I take now? I also have a hematologist and I have to have iron transfusions and vitamins and minerals done monthly because my body won t absorb them. Today, I am two pints low on my blood. I have seen my hematologist/oncologist for about 15-19 years. How do I approach this going forward? A nurse that I know said that pain doctors will not accept me as a patient and I have a situation with the doctor saying to take ibuprofen and I cannot take that due to the fact that it is a blood thinner for me. Sleep? that is a joke. I haven t slept a solid and normal night in so many years I cannot recall. Sometimes I do get lucky and fall asleep, BUT I will wake within a couple of hours. I had been told I need a sleep study, but again, I don t drive and the hours that someone would have to drop me off for the test is usually in bed by 7pm because he is up at 3am for HIS job. My son just graduated high school and works full time. We have one gas station and one place to really eat so options are limited so I have time to arrange my appointments around other s schedules. Advice is definitely in need. I have Ambetter insurance. My email will be on this but I have things to do before I can lay down, In my recliner, as always. Thanks in advance for any help you doctors who can help me: I take Keppra for prevention of seizures, clonozapam for anxiety, Soma for back pain and spasms which are continuous (again my brother, at age 22 was a passenger in a wreck and paralyzed him until he passed away from sepsis at the age of 34), and the accident that I was involved as a little girl, my dad and I rolled the windows in our big Brady Bunch car from California to Arkansas and blessedly, since we both had our windows open, I got out by being thrown out of the car and alone down the revene, to be found when they took 9 hours to get him from the car and was paralyzed from 1975 and ultimately had to have his legs removed in 1977 from gangrene, so surgery is something I won t consider because I am the worrier in the family. I have two grandsons that I would l play with and trying to keeping eyes on both is almost impossible, considering they are 1 and 2. Again, any response to my email would be gratefully appreciated.

In the past 5 years she has suffered badly with abdominal bloating which has increased in severity this last 12 months.The bloating is so severe she looks as if she is 9 months pregnant and the pain is unbearable.She is normally very active even athletic .Recently underwent flexible colonoscopy and endoscopy that showed no abnormality but fasting lactose tolerance failed to reveal any rise in her glucose level. Her severe reaction following consumption of the lactose substance made it in impossible for her to undertake a confirmation galactose test.She was discharged from her local hospital with no satisfactory explanation for her symptoms. Since then she has followed a strict lactose diet but she continues to get serious and debilitating bloating episodes. Her cholecystic scar is badly keloid and the pain is always located in that region and radiating to the back. When suffering an episode of bloating it is easy to palpate something that feels like tubes in the area of her liver. I would like to point out that her cholecystectomy was not an easy operation as she had badly blocked ducts and she was badly jaundice. Also she has noticed blood in her saliva on a few occasions during a bloating episode. My questions ..could the cause be due to adhesions and has the lactose intolerance be connected.","Doctor":"Hi.Thanks for your query for your daughter , read the history and understood her problems Your noticing : When suffering an episode of bloating it is easy to palpate something that feels like tubes in the area of her liver is highly suggestive of intestinal obstruction. The bloating is due to adhesions for sure. and not due to lactose intolerance. I would advise her the following:Get a CT scan done with water soluble contrast. -Plan for a surgery to get rid of the adhesions and get well soon ."},{"Patient":"Ok so I have had lower back pain since Monday.

Pain may arise from the fall itself, or the impact may have aggravated a pre-existing condition. Back pain that results from a slip-and-fall accident could possibly be very serious, and should not be ignored. Some common slip-and-fall or trip and fall injuries include:Cervical spine injuries – These injuries involve the neck. A bone may dislocate, potentially damaging the spinal cord. This unstable situation generally requires surgical correction.Fracture – A broken bone in the spine causes intense pain. In backward falls, the tailbone is often involved. Fractures range in severity, from simple fractures to those where the bone has burst.Herniated disc – Discs herniate when their soft centers, the nucleus pulpous, push through their harder shells, irritating neighboring nerves. Pain occurs in the affected area, which in falls may include the neck, upper or lower back, legs or buttocks. When the herniation compresses the nerves, tingling, weakness and numbness result. Herniated discs are also known as slipped discs.Soft tissue injuries – Falls often cause strained muscles and/or tendons or sprained ligaments. Besides pain, symptoms include swelling and loss of flexibility. The most serious type of sprain after a fall involves the neck. These injuries benefit from non-surgical treatments, including physical therapy.these may be the reasons why you are facing the issue.i will give some herb to reduce pain take these:-Tab.YOGARAJ GUGGULU 1-0-1 AFTER FOODMAHA NARAYAN OIL FOR LOCAL APPLICATION"},{"Patient":"I am having severe pain in my back, just to the left of my right shoulder blade.

When I first get up, no pain, but it sets in after moving around for about a half hour.  It comes and goes through the day.  If I set in a comfortable chair (like a lazyboy), the pain subsides, but comes back when I start to move around.   Sitting in the car is a little tricky since sometimes I have the pain.  If I lean a little to the right, it subsides.","Doctor":"Dear patient your symptoms points towards diagnosis of mechanical back ache reason being muscle spasm or instability of lumbar spine. I would advise xray of lumbo sacral spine anteroposterior and lateral views to go firm diagnosis. Start tab myoril 4mg twice a day with tab diclofenac sodium 50 mg twice a day for 5 days. Take rest on hard bed. If Xray is abnormal you need to visit orthopedic surgeon nearby you."},{"Patient":"Hi my daughter is in Ghana Africa and has indicated to me today that she feels like she has been hit by a bus...sore stomach and right side of her back is painful, slight fever and very tired.

The waterborne diseases are caused by the water source she is using. The parasites do not develop so early. This looks to be due to gastroenteritis and a course of an antibiotic and metronidazole with symptomatic treatment for pain, Oral rehydration solution, activated charcoal and probiotic will cover her nicely. If necessary she can go for the tests of the blood, urine and stool and also a Standing X-ray of the abdomen and an ultrasonography."},{"Patient":"Hello, I'm looking to confirm that the pain/discomfort I'm feeling in my back is a back strain and if so, how I should treat it. The pain started about a week ago, is moderate and dull, no sharpness or stinging but is ever present and only so far only relief has been lying down. Stretching and taking Advil hasn't helped at all. The pain is in the center-left of my back, not lower back but below the shoulder blades. I am in excellent physical condition but I play golf 2-3 times a week and I am pretty sure I started feeling the pain soon after my round last week. I played again yesterday and it didn't really bother me while playing and didn't seem any worse today. Is there anything I can do other than lying down to alleviate the pain? Would continuing to play golf risk actual damage?

The pain might be originating from the structures of the lower spine such as, vertebral joints and ligaments, muscles and tendons or trapped nerve. 2. It might be due to inflammation or infection in the left ovary or Fallopian tube e.g. pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) etc. Are you sexually active and in a stable relationship?? Any chance of pregnancy??3. Condition of the bowel such as diverticulitis or impacted faeces due to constipation could also cause pain. Are your bowel habits regular and normal??4.

I did, and because I did not have health insurance at the time, and my doctor did not believe it was accident related, returned to work and waited 8 months until I received insurance to. go in and get tested. The first test I was given was a Doppler ultrasound, blood & urine samples. What came back under UA Micro Panel: positive for Leuk sm1.

Unfortunately, I woke up late and missed the meeting. Called the clinic right away to reschedule but not able to get in until 6/23. I m upset because...I m tired of suffering. I ve gone back to work after my accident but have had to work on my feet all day with swollen ankles. I have swelling in both feet, but more so in my right ankle.

To confirm I would advise you the following.:Get X-ray of the abdomen in the standing position.Ultrasonography will help us the most for diagnosis of Pancratitis or left kidney problem like hydronephrosis, or so.Relevant blood, urine and stool tests as per the clinical diagnosis after examination by a Surgeon will help to have a proper diagnosis. Colonoscopy may be needed. The treatment will depend upon the diagnosis hence made."},{"Patient":"I had my mirena removed about 8 months ago and have had severe lower back pain every month during my cycle monthly. It started only lasting 2-3 days and now it lasts 3 weeks and I rarely have time with no back pain. Is this a side effect of removing it?","Doctor":"The detrimental effects of the Mirena IUD to users are many, with the worst being migration of the device, puncturing the uterine wall and damaging organs within the body cavity such as the liver and intestines. Other possible side effects are ectopic pregnancy, fatigue, depression, mood swings, painful cramps and many more. Many women who are opting to have the Mirena IUD removed to avoid complications are experiencing many of the symptoms that they sought to avoid. These symptoms also occur with women who had the device removed after the prescribed duration of five years. These detrimental effects, known as the Mirena crash, or Mirena IUD crash, can occur for weeks or even months after removal of the device. In a great number of women, the symptoms were severe enough to negatively impact their lives.The Mirena IUD is a T shaped device that is implanted in the uterus, containing a reservoir of synthetic progesterone which is slowly released. This synthetic product, Levonorgestral, causes a thickening of the mucous membrane inhibiting the travel of sperm, preventing pregnancy.Mirena Crash after RemovalSo, what is the Mirena crash? The Mirena crash is the name given to the symptoms of pain and discomfort that are prompted when the birth-control device is removed and the flow of synthetic hormones stop. It can be weeks or longer before the body realizes it needs to produce its own progesterone because it has become “lazy”, relying on the synthetic provision. This causes hormone imbalance or estrogen dominance. This same period of time reflects the Mirena crash duration. In many women this imbalance causes severe symptoms similar to those associated with the usage of the device. In some women, Mirena crash symptoms appear recurrently before each period, lasting for months. Some other women suffer for extended periods of time both physically and emotionally at any time, day or night. One sufferer described her feelings as being “smothered with severe despair” at night.How long does the Mirena crash last?Some women have reported the crash only lasting a few days, while others report weeks or months. Medically speaking, there is no way to tell. This is because it all depends on how long your body takes to return to a normal hormonal balance. The sooner this happens, the sooner the symptoms will dissipate.Mirena Crash SymptomsMirena crash symptoms include:Runaway emotions such as anxiety, sadness, anger and depression. Severe cases have produced suicidal thoughts.Frequent mood swings that can strain relationships and effect work performanceLethargyPhysical symptoms such as muscle fatigue, cough, sore throat and even fever which are often misdiagnosedNausea, vomiting and stomach painBreast tendernessDecreased sex drive and painful sex."},{"Patient":"I ve had 4 major back surgeries including A/P Fusion..My surgeon won t do anymore surgeries on me..We were doing the shots,but I don t like having the steroids in them..What is the best over the counter pain reliever to use..I won t take the hard core pain meds","Doctor":"Hello,Thank you for using Healthcaremagic.I read your question and understood your concern.The strongest over the counter medicine is VOLTAREN ( tablets)You can try those but after eating as it may give you stomach upset.Also you can combine with some physiotherapy procedures such as ultrasound.Wish you quick recovery.Dr. Selmani"},{"Patient":"Hi I was in a car accident a year ago.

I hope you feel better soon , It is a kind of allergy or hyper sensitivity reaction may be due to your medication or else maybe  this is a sort of cervical radiating pain due to neuro-vascular compression on nerve endings in your spine at the cervical region .    In most of cases pain may subside simultaneously without medication with rest and avoiding any heavy lifting , over weighing ,vigorous movements and bad sleeping and sitting postures .     For my patients i may recommend advil tabs when needed , hot gentle massaging with topical anti-inflammatory gels , B12 vitamin supplements and muscle relaxants with some neck stretching exercises and spinal straightening exercises will be effective for most of cases .in more severe and chronic cases steroid tabs or injections are prescribed .       If pain persists i recommend MRI scan on cervical vertebrae to exclude any disc herniation and follow them up with your neurologist for better evaluation and management .

The lower back pain on your right lower side could be either a trigger point over a muscle which can be treated easily with manipulation and massaging. Now the nature of pain is what is more important. If you are having a lower back pain which is radiating all along the side then it might need some evaluation, as that is a red flag sign; given the prior history of liver and pancreatic cancer.

You history is so specific that I can tell you that you most probably have a herniated disc in the spine compressing on the spinal cord, causing the local pain as well as the referred pain to the abdomen. The history of 6 months supports this. Zerodol should not be taken for such a long time as it may cause gastric ulcers and related GI disturbances.

Your low back pain and hip pain maybe relted to muscular spasm or sciatica due to nerve compression . in many cases pain subsides simultaneously without medications only with rest .     Try to avoid over weighing , heavy lifting , obesity , vigorous movements and bad sleeping or sitting postures . Physiotherapy is very beneficial you may use hot massages with topical anti-inflammatory gels and take painkillers like advil tab when needed , vitamin B12 supplements and muscle relaxants will be effective in most of cases .

To take the best result from the test you must do the test one week after the missed period. This is the time when the HCG hormone is high enough in the urine to be detected by the test. If you can not wait to do this, the best solution is to go to your doctor a do a blood test for pregnancy.Also, the urine must be taken early in the morning when it is most concentrated. A diluted urine during the day may lead to false negative results. Read the package instructions for the home pregnancy test and wait enough time to see the result.As you have other health symptoms it is possible that you suffer from a gynecologic problem and you must clear this up after seeing a specialist.

For the last couple of days I ve had a sharp pain mostly on my right upper shoulder and back area. The pain comes and goes but is most evident at night. At times it goes away completely but will suddenly come back. It s the same kind of pain that you feel at the onset of the flu but it does not have the accompanying symptoms. It seems to move around from one part of my body to another.","Doctor":"Hi there. Pain over the upper shoulder and back region most commonly is myofascial in nature. That is there are these certain areas of the upper back that are known to act as trigger points. It feels like a dull aching, sometimes cramping pain. Low levels of vitamin D, Improper posture while sitting at work, sleeping on a hard pillow can cramp these muscles of the neck and upper back and can lead to this. So i suggest you get an appointment from a physiotherapist and ask for a trigger point release which is quite effective. Also get guidance for proper sitting posture and get your vitamin D levels checked. If the level is low you might need to take some supplemenation for the same. Local analgesic ointments and sprays can alleviate your pain to some extent. Do look out for any numbness, tingling sensations or weakness in your hands for which you might need to see doctor and get yourself evaluated for a possible spine related problem.

What could it be with my legs its starting to scare me?","Doctor":"Hi there. Its unlikely that you are having any problems with your legs, so you need not worry about that. It mainly looks like you're having a disc related or degenerative problem in your back based on how old you are, and it is causing compression of nerve roots or spinal cord and causing pain over the legs which are supplied by them. Take bed rest for some 3-4 days, oral analgesics, local analgesic spray or ointments might help. You can ambulate to the bathroom to begin with and then increase slowly to around the house as the pain subsides and then resume your normal activities. In the even the pain does not settle at all, then you might need a further evaluation with X rays of your back and a check up to see if you're having any progressive neurological deficits or not. Once you regain your daily activites, try losing some weight and back muscle strengthening exercises that might avoid any recurrences in future.

He exercised (elliptical) Monday night and that seemed to aggravate the symptoms. The pain has been very severe today, He can t sleep, has tried some pain and sleep medications to no avail...","Doctor":"Hi there. It seems like your husband has aggravated an underlying disc problem which he might have been having for sometime. Sudden exercises can aggravate such problems if somebody is not used to it. For a patient having an acute pain i would initially recommend a period of bed rest for 3-4 days until the pain subsides.He can sleep with his hips and knees flexed that will reduce a bit of pressure on the nerve roots that are getting compressed. He can take Aceclofenac 100 mg to add to the initial pain relief and apply some topical analgesic ointments or sprays. During the period he can walk to the bathroom and walk around as tolerated. He would need to avoid sitting for a long time if possible. Then once the pain subsides he can get back to his normal day to day activities. Then he should build up his back muscle strength by doing extension exercises. And if he is on the heavier side he should do a bit of dieting and exercises that for losing weight that will help him in the long run. Any exercise regime should be started with gradual increments in the repeats. Ellipse is a demanding machine and one needs to increase their training gradually. Thank you."},{"Patient":"I have sciatica. I had lumbar surgery 40+ years ago with disc removal. Now at times the sciatic pain is often quite intent and at times I have to urinate right away to relieve the pain and also sit down for a short period of time. I take xaralto for DVT and Plavix, an operation is not recommended. Your opinion please.","Doctor":"Hi there. Back pain and sciatica can be quite disabling at times. Right now with the way your symptoms are going, i'm sure the nerve roots around your vertebrae might be getting compressed in some way due to all the degenerative changes that have happened over the last 40 years. Now when it comes to conservative management, whenever you have an episode of intense pain, take bed rest for some time and ambulate only within your limits, avoid sitting for ling time. As the pain comes down and during those intervals of time when you are asymptomatic or relatively pain free, concentrate on strengthening your back muscles by doing extension exercises. Weight loss by either dieting or going for regular walks will help you a long way by reducing the loads that your spine will be subjected to. Try avoiding excessive manipulation by a chiropractor or a massage therapist as given the prior history of disc surgery already performed on your back, the  pain might worsen. Thank you."},{"Patient":"i have severe back pain I dont know what i did. I was on my knees at work and leaned forward and over and got a severe shooting pain in lower back.

So for that examination of nerves,  reflexes etc should be checked The causes can be.... -ligament,  muscle strain -disc bulging -arthritis -ankylosing spondylitis (if walk by leaning forward) -infection  spine -tumour etc..... Mostly it might be related to strain but examination needed as pain is severe MRI investigation done If needed According to cause further specific treatment given Until then ibuprofen can be taken for five days Take care Hope your concern solved Consult orthopedic surgeon for examination and discuss all these"},{"Patient":"I m 50 years old , thought I had pulled or turned wrong last winter pickin up grand daughter, went to the chiropractor for 2 months , still had the pain , went to the drs ,told it was sciatic in my left side lower back, had xray told severe arthritis ,need advice on pain relief","Doctor":"dear patient.when you didn't get relief from back pain for last 2 years, we need more investigation to confirm diagnosis first. I would like to do your mri of lumbo sacral spine with screening of whole spine. this would help in diagnosing arthritis, disc prolapse , infective pathology and instability. at your age arthritis be degenerative or inflammatory. treatment for both conditions are different.i would also advise radiography of lower spine lateral view in full flexion and extension to rule out instability. please do this investigations as soon as possible so that we can suggest you better treatment. meanwhile you can take tramadol 37.5mg twice a day for pain relief."},{"Patient":"So, my 30 year old son and I were out, at a buffet. He was standing at the buffet, and he explains something popped in his back. It took his breath away, and he was having a hard time standing up. It is about an hour later now, and the pain is still there, not as intense and no effect on breathing. The pain is actually to the far right side of his back...closer to his side (lower back). Any ideas on what would cause that kind of pain...with sudden onset, when he was not doing anything that would strain a muscle?","Doctor":"Hi there. Looks like your son with the prior history of pain over the far right side of back and difficulty in standing up has developed a spasm of the back muscle. These muscle spasms need not be always related to what the affected individual was doing at the time of having the onset of pain, but can be related to any abnormal posturing such as bending for a long time prior to the onset of the pain which would have fatigued his back muscles. The pop sound he heard or felt could be probably a disc problem that may lead to a secondary spasm, so if he is having a persisting pain radiating to the right side alone and not subsiding with rest and pain medications, kindly get a MRI scan of the spine and get him evaluated. So in the acute setting a few days of bed rest, local analgesic ointment, a 3 day course of tramadol should be enough.  In case of pain radiating down the leg or the hip, or any weakness of lower limb on one side, get additional scans and get him checked."},{"Patient":"Ok. I woke up Monday night with extreme pain in my back, arms, legs, and feet. I took 4 Advil and it helped the pain. But I was told I cannot continue the Advil so I was given Tylenol with coding. I get chills when the pain is bad, and it just throbs constantly. So my doctor dosent know what I have. I also get cramps in my thighs and calfs. I am in a lot of pain.","Doctor":"Dear patient thank you for your question.I am sorry you are in so much pain.what i am interested in knowing is why the doctor told you not to take advil. Also it seems strange that he/she has not indicated what condition you might be suffering withIn any case i feel you may have a condition called fibromyalgiaFibromyalgia is a disorder characterized by widespread musculoskeletal pain accompanied by fatigue, sleep, memory and mood issues. It is believed that fibromyalgia amplifies painful sensations by affecting the way your brain processes pain signals.symptoms of fibromyalgia:Pain areas: in the muscles, abdomen, back, elbow, or neckPain types: can be chronic, diffuse, sharp, throbbing, or severePain circumstances: can occur at nightSleep: difficulty falling asleep, sleep disturbances, or sleepinessGastrointestinal: constipation, nausea, or passing excessive amounts of gasWhole body: fatigue, feeling tired, or malaiseMuscular: muscle tenderness, delayed onset muscle soreness, or muscle spasmsSensory: pins and needles, sensitivity to cold, or sensitivity to painCognitive: forgetfulness or lack of concentrationMood: anxiety or mood swingsHand: sensation of coldness or tinglingAlso common: depression, flare, headache, irritability, joint stiffness, nervousness, painful menstruation, or tingling feetTreatment of fibromylagia:Pain relievers. Over-the-counter pain relievers such as acetaminophen (Tylenol, others), ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin IB, others) or naproxen sodium (Aleve, others) may be helpfulAntidepressants. Duloxetine (Cymbalta) and milnacipran (Savella) may help ease the pain and fatigue associated with fibromyalgia.Anti-seizure drugs. Medications designed to treat epilepsy are often useful in reducing certain types of pain. Gabapentin (Neurontin) is sometimes helpful in reducing fibromyalgia symptoms, while pregabalin (Lyrica) was the first drug approved by the Food and Drug Administration to treat fibromyalgia.Alternative treatment:Physical therapy. A physical therapist can teach you exercises that will improve your strength, flexibility and stamina. Water-based exercises might be particularly helpful.To summarize, Fibromyalgia medication can be given by a physician only after a proper physical examination and after finding out your history for allergies or side effects to the above mentioned drugs.Therefore please discuss the fibromyalgia as a possible diagnosis with you doctor"},{"Patient":"Dear Drs, 12 hours ago, i was out drinking and at somepoint i suddenly felt dizzy and fainted. As i lost consciousness i fell on the floor on my side and now have a bump on the side of my head, at the forehead area, right above my ear and also feel a bit sore on my side and hip. I went to the hospital where my blood pressure was low and i had an x-ray of my head, which seemed fine. At the moment, i feel a bit cold and the thermometer says 37.5 and i get occasional abdominal sensation or mild ache.

Also is there something that i can do for the sweeling?","Doctor":"Hi.Thanks for your detailed history.You should see a Doctor once again for 2 reasons:1) to get the vitals , pupils, power of the limbs checked as you had a fall, unconsciousness and related symptoms2) you have to get ans MRI of the brain to see the causative factor or a result of head-injury on fall. -also to get the symptomatic treatment for the dizziness and mild pain in abdomen after the MRI report. -To get admitted if the MRI or clinical examination is indicative of any serious problem in the brain."},{"Patient":"For the past 48 hrs I have had a stabbing pain in my back, I think it is the area of my gall bladder, I also have pain in my abdomen just under my ribs. Which is very painful if pressed, but not as bad as the constant stabbing pain in my back. I suffer very badly from heartburn always and am on medication (lansoprazole) for this. I also have a hiatus hernia. I do not want to bother my dr, but the constant pain is getting me down. My skin and the whites of my eyes do not appear to be yellow, and I do not feel nauseous","Doctor":"Dear patient thank you for your question. Let me start by saying that you have every right to consult your doctor it would not be bothering him/her because you are his/her's patient.In my view you either have a severe case of heartburn brought about by the hernia or a complication known as esophagitis which is also a complication of the hernia. Your doctor will have to increase the dosage of lansoprazole but if it doesn't help you may have to go in for surgery of the hiatus hernia.i would be remiss if i did not tell you that it could be the following possibilities as well1) Stomach Ulcer: A ruptured or bleeding ulcer can lead to a similar sirt of pain. An indication of this is if you have pain while eating, constipation/diarrhoea or black tarry stools2) Gallstone: Flatulance constipation and severe pain on breathing may point towards gallstone. A simple usg bladder will rule it out.3)Pancreatitis: Severe pain RADIATING to the back which is relieved on crouching forward. A pancreatic profile and cat scan should rule it out. I would like to stress again that you should definitely contact your doctor and discuss the above mentioned possibilities as hiatus hernia is no small thing.i hope this helped"},{"Patient":"i have severe lower back pain even when lying on my back it is bad i felt my lower left side of my back due to putting pressure on my back i felt something in my left lower back slipping just went its also painful onmy right mostly left lower back pain is worse am like this five days now using diffene jel some painkillers what could be the problem how long will my back take to heal whats my best option for this .","Doctor":"Dear patient thank you for your question.Before we begin treatment we have to diagnose your condition. It can be tricky to diagnose back problems such as the ones you have described without imaging so my first and foremost advise to you is to get an x-ray/ct scan done.The condition to me seems to be lumbar spondylosis. Therefore while I cannot treat you online without knowing exactly what you have here are some suggestion which should benefit you.1) Take flexon Mr 500mg thrice a day. It contains a muscle relaxant which will decrease your spasms. It is contraindicated if you have a liver disease2) Gels will not have a major effect in this situation so it is useless to use them. I suggest hot fomentation therapy for your back3) I will stress again it is imperative that you show yourself to the orthopedic surgeon at the earliest as a condition like this could progress and result in complications like loss of bowel and bladder movement and pain down your leg etc. I wish you all the best"},{"Patient":"Hello Dr. I have lower back pain on the left side.

The reason you have back pain while sitting in the floor or exercising is because in those conditions the back muscles maximally come into play. To answer your other question yes one of the known side effects of Tylenol is drowsiness.Here are my suggestions:1) switch from Tylenol to flexon MR 500mg twice a day2) Avoid rigorous exercise for 3 weeks3) Ice pack to your lower left back after exerciseI hope it helps."},{"Patient":"I have been experiencing horrible back pain at night time and I did go to urgent care yesterday to see if I had a UTI but it came up negative so I m not really sure what it is and it s getting really bad I ve been experiencing also night sweats and I accidentally Peed myself last night and when I woke up I Felt very very weak like someone you had just pushed me down really hard","Doctor":"Dear patient. Thank you for the question.Let me start by saying that the main reason for your night sweats and loss of bladder control with back pain is nerve impingement. While there are a number of causes of nerve impingement the most common is acute spondylosis where the jelly between your vertebrae protrudes/herniates out.Other causes could be1) Cauda equina syndrome2) ankylosis spondylitis3)TB spine if you are from a developing countryMy suggestion is to go to an orthopedic surgeon and get 1 ) local examination of back2) MRI/ct scan3) complete blood count.in the meantime to decrease symptoms I suggest ibuprofen 800mg twice a day"},{"Patient":"I ve been having a lot of sharp pains on the upper left and right side that go to my back as of lately I ve been finding hard red flakes and even black dots in my poop.

As you have not mentioned the autoimmune disease you have or the medications you are taking I am afraid I will not be able to narrow down the exact pathology.

I have severe back pain daily trouble breathing and cant sleep when its time to but will fall asleep many times through out the day (while driving). Now I am having paralyzing stomach cramps if I move wrong. I have seen the Dr. many times and says all my test come back fine Im Just fat... I feel like I cant deal with fat until I deal with the pain.","Doctor":"THANK YOU FOR YOUR QUESTION.Let me begin by saying that you definitely have acondition called Obstructive sleep apnea. It is common in overweight patients. The neck fat presses on the windpipe and causes snoring and does not allow a good nights sleep and hence the falling asleep during the day. ways to treat:1) Portable bipap at home. Its the best and most recognized treatment2) Surgery: A severe but more permanent solutionThe shortess of breath is also due to the fat which along with gravity restricts chest movement.For your backpain i agree with the doctor that it is mostly due to the weight. U see the spine is like the pillar of the body and takes on most of our weight. As you are overweight the spine is extremely stressed and thus the pain. I suggest U start cycling and see a dietician for your weight.In the meantime Take Flexon mr 500mg thrice a day for the pain.This should hopefully treat the cramps as well. If you have a history of stomach ulcer or heartburn take pantoprazole 40mg as well"},{"Patient":"I am an extremly active 59 yr old female. I have gained 38 lbs or more over the past 3 years.

But, litterally, over night, my hips, the joints, started hurting very bad.Also my lower back & has now moved into the groin area. I m now walking with an extreme limp. After cleaning a house, that same night, I awoke racked in pain like I never experienced before. From the hips, swollen knees, to the groin area & swollen feet, I could not move- at all. It was that painful. It took me at least an hour to lift one leg to the floor. I could not walk at all. I went to 3 specialists with no answer. No rehitoid artritis, no gout. I have been going to a pain clinic 20 years every 2 months due to lumbar facet disease. Plus on opiat medication which does nothing now.

Lumbar facet disease is a type of degenerative arthritis that can cause narrowing of the canal through which your nerve roots pass and depending on the level of the vertebrae that is getting affected. I can understand that a person with a very active lifestyle like you hates being told again and again that they're growing old but that is not the only problem you are having. You're a caregiver and have history of lifting heavy weights which kind of add to the loads that your back is facing and probably worsening the facet problem. Now the various treatment options for this are taking rest, lifestyle changes, weight loss, physiotherapy exercises like core muscle and paraspinal muscle strengthening exercises. For somebody who is having a persisiting problem like you are i would like to recommend a trial of ESI or Epidural steroid injections. These are mainly used for disc related pain but they might prove to be of some benefit in chronic inflammation of the nerve roots which can occur in facet disease. Also please avoid lifting heavy weights, i can understand it is an integral part of your profession but there are certain physiological limits to which you can exert your body. Also, that these injections, even surgery will take care of your pain in the thighs and around the hips and the groin but the back pain may reduce or may even persisit. The reason being that there are numerous pain generators in the back which might contribute towards your local back pain,not just facets alone."},{"Patient":"I am 60 years old.

Chronic analgesic intake is hardly a solution for degenerative diseases of the spine. its a temporary solution which has many associated effects of kidney damage and gastrointestinal ulceration. Imagine this process to be due to natural wear and tear of the body. The anterior lipping of vertebrae is a feature of the same. Lifestyle modification and physiotherapy are the two main modalities of the treatment that can offload your spine and reduce the degenerative process. Weight loss also plays a very important role. Reduce lifting heavy weights and bending down and working for long periods of time. Do some back exercises to help off load the anterior vertebrae. Topical creams over the lower back may be of help."},{"Patient":"I have pain in my right side and back. Over the last 4 months it has grown in intensity and frequency. It used to come 3-4 days a month and now it is almost daily. Pain is 6/10 most days. My medical history includes Lupus and food allergies. Liver enzymes run on the high side but not high enough for my doctor to be concerned.","Doctor":"lupus is an immune disease that can attack many internal organs and tissues. The classic parts of the skeleton that can be affected by the inflammation of lupus are the peripheral joints - the joints away from the spine, such as the small joints of the hands and feet, the wrists, knees, elbows, ankles, and shoulders. Lupus commonly causes arthritis in these joints. The spine is generally spared from the inflammation of lupus.Lupus can cause neck and back pain, however, because muscles can become inflamed by lupus. Furthermore, the muscle pain syndrome called fibromyalgia that can cause pain in these areas is commonly associated with lupus. Moreover, cortisone medications that are frequently needed for lupus can weaken the bones of the spine, leading to breakage (fractures) of vertebrae. Also, a rare complication of lupus that involves inflammation of the spinal cord (transverse myelitis) can be associated with back pain.Finally, neck and back pain most frequently result from injury or wear and tear (degenerative change with aging). This is true in the general population and is also true for patients with lupus. However, there are many causes of pains in these areas, ranging from organ disease (such as kidney problems and others) to disc herniations. It is not possible for me to know what the exact cause(s) of your particular neck and back pain are. For this you must consult your doctor."},{"Patient":"I m having trouble sleeping tonight.

Most of the times the cause of the bloating and burning sensation is related to the stress, anxiety and tensions.You have to continue nexium and get a prescription for anxiety too and you may be fine. If there is no effect you will have to undergo upper GI Endoscopy and other tests to find any other concomitant medical or surgical problems ..."},{"Patient":"I have severe back pain in my lower back. This was not a surprise because I broke my back 4 years ago and had lingering pain, however it has gotten worse in the last few weeks. Along with that I have noticed my penis has changed. It has a noticeable bend that I have never had. Any suggestions what this could be.","Doctor":"The history is a little less on this one. However it seems that you either have  a Peyronies disease or an intertrochantric fracture of femur which is rare than the former.In case of Peyronie's u may have noticed plaques or pain on erection or narrowing/shortening of penis.If so i recommend you see your doctor as the treatment icludes:Corticosteroid injections into the fibrous band of tissuePotaba (a medicine taken by mouth)Radiation therapyShock wave lithotripsyVerapamil injection (a medicine used to treat high blood pressure)Vitamin E"},{"Patient":"I live in TORONTO Ontario Canada. I am have chronic back pain that has become unbearable. I am now up to taking 8-10 80 mg. tablets of oxyneo daily...and I am still suffering with excruciating back pain. My family doctor has sent out some referral letters to spine surgeons but they are not taking on anymore referrals. I feel hopeless! Can you help me? Thank you!","Doctor":"Hi there. Back pain can be really severe and incapacitating at times. Now the first question I should ask you is this: is it a pain which radiates down your thighs and legs, and do you have any associated difficulty in passing urine or stools? if so you may be having features of spinal cord compression and need urgent evaluation by spine surgeon. If you're having back pain alone, then a majority of it can be treated with changing your lifestyle, avoiding lifting heavy weights, or bending down and working. For acute onset pain analgesics may be helpful. Bed rest only for 3-5 days maximum. Prolonged bed rest is actually harmful as it causes wasting of your back muscles which are  important stabilisers of your spinal column. So a gradual starting if physio is more useful. There are exercises for core abdominal muscles and paraspinal muscles which can help. Surgery for back pain alone might not give you expected results all the time. it is useful mainly if there is associated cord compression going on."},{"Patient":"Sir I am 50 years old male suffering with upper back pain severly since 3 months and all of sudden onset aggravate by body movements and better by rest and pain killer medicine and x-ray says larger ostyophytes seen & my vit D is 5 only. Please suggest me what kind of treatment I should adapt and since one month I am consuming tab sazo 1gm no improvement","Doctor":"Hello. You have what appears as degenerative disease of the spine along with Vitamin D deficiency. Low Vitamin D levels can aggravate the para-spinal muscle spasm and fatigue which  will worsen your back pain even more. So take a course of Calcirol granules, 60,000 units once every week for 6 weeks followed by once every month for 6 months. At the end of 6 months, check your levels again. The treatment of degenerative disease of spine is mainly with physiotherapy, trigger point releases of the back muscles which can occur in patients with low vitamin D and local application of analgesic ointment.  Try to sit with the back straight while sitting."},{"Patient":"I have a long standing problem in my mid to upper back, aggravated by lifting heavy weights (bench press), or doing things like serving in tennis or throwing a ball without properly warming up. I ve had it for 30 years. Is this just likely a muscle that I injured and that I keep aggravating?","Doctor":"Hi there. The pain you experience in your mid upper back could be due to mainly a faulty technique while using bench press or that you're not giving your back muscles adequate time to rest and recover. This can have possible long term implication on your spine by causing degenerative changes earlier. I suggest that you take enough breaks between each rep and if you're planning to increase the weights do so gradually so your muscles get time to adapt to it. Throwing motion without properly warming up can also harm your back muscles as well."},{"Patient":"I fell on 1/16/17, on the ice and when I fell I landed on my back in a curve. I went to the Dr. because I was in so much pain, She just checked me over and sent me home. Three days later the pain was worse, I went back to the Dr. she just had me do a few exercises, to see how bad it hurt. That had me in tears, she gave me 3 day supply of muscle relaxers. I went back on the 24, and she finally done an X-Ray, which showed that I a very badly bruised back bone. The pain just kept getting worse as I never stopped working, on the 2nd of March they finally did a MRI, showing that I had a compression fracture at T7 and bulging disc and L4 & L5. All this time I had worked making beds and running up and down stairs and running vacuum cleaners. Now the pain is so unbearable and I am losing feeling in my left leg. The specialist just told me to avoid falls. My question is: since worked and kept doing everything that I normally do, could I have messed my back more?","Doctor":"Hi, I went through your history and have identified the following problems;  I have not seen your X rays or MRI films so my opinion of this is going to be a limited one.1. The T7 compression fracture: This fracture must have been a stable fracture, as you have been weight bearing and walking even after the fall. An unstable fracture would have contributed to new neurological deficits that you would have experienced and not allowed you to bear weight at all.And since its been more than 3 months since the injury, the fracture would have healed by now anyway. Since it takes an average of 6 weeks for vertebral body fractures to heal.2. The disc bulge if severe enough at L4-5 can contribute to numbness over the back of your calf. This would signify a neurological compression. If it was a bad disc bulge or disc prolapse as we call it you would most likely need a surgical intervention. So in conclusion, you wouldn't have messed your back more by this. But i suggest you show a spine surgeon who could take a look at your problems, examine you clinically and correlate with your MRI images and decide whether you need any surgical intervention or not."},{"Patient":"My mother is 89 years old and she has been complaining of severe back pain for months.

On 12/29/16 I had diney stones removed, stent placed. 2 weeks later another surgery for a stone they missed. No blood in urine, no cramping. I m just not sure if it could be another stone ( I did not hurt like this the last time) or a kidney infection. Any thoughts?","Doctor":"Hi Tammy, After going through your history my first step would be rule out a urinary tract infection,Firstly since you've already had stones earlier, secondly that women are generally more prone to get infection of the urinary tract. So i would start off with doing a urine analysis. Also get an X ray of your lower back. It could be possible that your back pain may be mechanical in nature due to any spasmodic pain of your back muscle,also that in your age many women suffer from osteoporosis as well. But, i would treat you for that only after doing appropriate lab investigations and x rays.  Thank you."},{"Patient":"Suddenly I felt sick to my stomach, got cold sweats and bad middle back pain.

Take 50 to 60 ml of coconut oil or sesame oil and fry 7 to 8 cloves of garlic in it and fry till the garlic turns brown. Apply this oil when lukewarm on affected area and do gentle massage for 5 to 10 minutes.

You may ask your doctor  or your orthopedic specialist for intra-articular steroid injections  if you could not withstand pain , if that treatment also failed for 6 consecutive month then i recommend a neurosurgeon point of view .   Your neurologist may decide minor endoscopic interventions to free your nerve disc compression , nowadays endoscopic interventions are highly developed and gives good results in more severe cases spinal fixation with rods and plates may be recommended .  So i think you have to maintain your physical profile , use medications when needed and you will feel better soon if not follow up with your neurologist for proper evaluation and management.Please click and consider a 5 star rating with some positive feedback if the information was helpful.

I was supposed to have started my period about 2 days ago. I don t know if that has anything to do with the cause of the pain. What would you recommend me do about the pain???","Doctor":"Hello! thank you for your query, The most common cause of missed menses is pregnancy. First of all, before you take any medications make sure to rule out pregnancy first if you had any contact with your partner. If you have a regular cycle and this is the first time you missed your period then I advise taking a pregnancy test. Other causes of missed menses include hormonal imbalances and stress. Regarding your low back pain, it may only be a muscular, but if your low back pain is accompanied by fever, difficulty urinating, you may do a urinalysis(urine exam) and Kidney Ureter Bladder ultrasound as these may indicate a kidney problem or urinary tract infection. Also, if there is an accompanied unusual vaginal discharge along with fever it may also be due to a pelvic inflammatory disease problem. Please check with your medical doctor for further assessment and evaluation if the pain continues.Meanwhile, I advise you to put hot water bag on the affected area for 15 minutes 2-3x a day, have plenty of rest and drink lots of water. If pregnancy is ruled out, then you can take any painreliever such as mefenamic acid 500mg 3x a day or ibuprofen 200mg every 6 hours for pain.

Sore throat, ear ache, headache, general biody aches. The flue like syptoms seem to come and go","Doctor":"Dear User, Thank You for choosing Health Care Magic,I do understand Your concern.There are many people that experience back pain as part of flu symptoms, but You explained that you had it before the flu. In your case what happened is that you used to suffer from back pain (chronic or acute, I will explain later), and the flu excarcebated it, so made it worse. When the flu will go away (consider Ibuprofen, paracetamol, home remedies for treatment), the back pain will release or will get at the phase that was before you had the flu.If you had this back pain in one side for the first time of your life only three weeks ago, please remember if you injured your hips, or if you are doing exercise that stress your back, or if you are staying sitted in one place for too long.If none of the causes mentioned above is not true, than I would suggest a urine analysis to check the condition of your kidneys.Mean while, I would recommend some topical antiinflammatory cream to relieve the back pain and also any heating pad, or specific belts which you can find in drugstores.I did this explanation to clarify you that your back pain did not cause the flu and there is any other reason beyond this two conditions. The back pain, in your case was strengthed by the flu, and will go on after if you are not accidentelly hurted or stressing your back. To make it go away follow my instructions mentioned above.I wish You all the best,Dr. Eni."},{"Patient":"Hi, may I answer your health queries right now ?

What happened to You may be muscle soreness or muscle injury after lifting weights.In the case of the soreness it means that you muscle are getting stronger in that area.In the case of the injury, which is the most probably situation of your suffer, I will suggest not to worry too much, beacuse the muscle will regenerate itself. Give your organism its own time, helping it with proteins and sugar in your diet. Also consider massaging, or swimming in hot pools. If you can not afford this, please let the hot water run in that area that aches while you are in douche. Cover it up with some topical antiinflammatory cream and consider buying some muscle patches that are sticked in your skin and do not let the muscle move, giving it time to regenerate. I think these are found in your nearest drugstore.Consider drinking Herbal tee like camommille, that together with the topical cream will relieve the pain. If it is too strong you may take some oral ibuprofene.Diet, massage, and the belt or the patch, will help the muscle regenerate.Do not stress, or exercise this period.All the best,Dr. Eni"},{"Patient":"HI!

By that evening it left me in bed completely immobilized in bed exactly where I have been since with the exception of absolute necessary trips to the bathroom due to the fact that it is most painful getting out of bed. Now I have had the mis-fortune of having passed 6 kidney stones over the years and at first I thought it might be that again because the pain can be very much the same to some extent from other lower back pains & kidney pains. But I am urinating somewhat normal and same with bowel movements which both have been affected by the trimmers and spasms that keep coming and going. I m not one for pain medication unless absolutely necessary because it just masks the pain and gives me a reason to accidently mis use whatever it is.

Since you have mentioned that you have as chronically suffered back ache for about 26 years it has to be related with any defect in the spine with nerve compression or due to diabetic neuropathy or lack of nutrients like Cobalamine.This occurs mostly due to our lifestyle habits like usage of computers, watching lot of TV, bending while reading.1) You can use analgesics like Paracetamol/Tylenol to relieve from pain.2) Do not use analgesics excessively. It is harmful to our body when in excess.3) You need to keep an erect straight posture of your back and neck.4) Do stretching exercises, when you wake up lie on your chest then using two hand lift yourself up, in a arc like position and then lie down slowly. Repeat his at least ten times daily. This will surely relieve back pain. You can watch online videos for such exercises.5) Take Tablet Neurokind once daily, anlagesics only if you have severe pain.6) If your problem aggravates you need to get yourself physically examined and investigated through radiological methods like X ray followed by MRI only if suggested by an orthopedician.Since you have chronic pain, it is most probable that you have undertaken radiological examinations.

They cause more trouble.3) You need to keep an erect straight posture of your back and neck.4) Do stretching exercises, when you wake up lie on your chest then using two hand lift yourself up, in a arc like position and then lie down slowly. Repeat his at least ten times daily. This will surely relieve back pain. You can watch online videos for such exercises.5) If your problem aggravates you need to get yourself physically examined and investigated through radiological methods like X ray and MRI.6) An USG abdomen is also recommended in cases for a female, to rule out gynecological problems.Hope these suggestions help you.

There is reduced signal intensity of all the cervical intervertebral discs, suggestive ofdiscal degeneration and oedema. There is posterior herniation of the C3/C4, C4/C5, C5/C6and C6/C7 intervertebral discs. There is anterior indentation of the thecal sac by theherniating discs, without significant spinal canal stenosis or cord compression. Similardegenerative changes are also seen in the visualized proximal dorsal vertebrae.There is irregularity of the endplates of the C6 and C7 vertebrae.No sign of ligamentum flavum thickening or facet joint hypertrophy.There is no abnormal paravertebral soft tissue mass.Myelogram done shows mild reduction of the CSF space around the spinal cord","Doctor":"Homeopathy has a very promising role in the treatment of cervical spondylosis. The long term results of homeopathy are very encouraging. Homoeopathic treatment of cervical spondylosis is dependant upon an important factor i.e. amounts of degenerative changes that have taken place in the bones and the disk. In other words the extent of damage to your spine will determine the speed at which your problem gets cured and also to what extent you get cured. In cases where there are mild to moderate changes in the cervical spine the cure is much faster and the recovery is very substantial. Along with medication we need to realize the importance of prevention of diseaseAs we get more and more absorbed into modern lifestyle like increased working and prolonged driving hours, sitting in front of computer and television for hours together and sedentary life style, it leads to increased wear and tear in our neck muscles and spine. This is what further predisposes us to early and rapid changes in our bones and vertebrae. Thus lifestyle modifications are the first step in preventing the further degeneration and an early onset of cervical spondylosis.Consult me for homeopathic treatment without side effects."},{"Patient":"Hi, so since i woke up today, my lower back hurts.

I have shoe inserts which leveled my hips and legs. I recently pulled a muscle in my lower back. I have been experiencing lower back pain and stiffness, along with sciatic pain.

Movement also provides some relief. The pain moves around between the testicles and base of the penis. Sometimes it disappears completely.

There have also been no physical signs, i.e. discharge, burning/pain while urinating, cloudy or smelly urine, blood in urine/ejaculate, etc. I have had issues with urination for at least 10 years.

In my opinion you may add some muscle relaxants and steroid intramuscular injections and some anticonvulsants that helps you sleep easier with lesser pain attacks. Neck exercises like extension, retraction, shoulder retraction, and isometric hold are highly suggestive in such cases. You may ask your neurosurgeon for further evaluation to recommend you the required dosing according to your condition.Sometimes a surgical solution is better especially after 6 months of treatment by physiotherapy and medications. Spinal surgeons can remove just the protruding portion of the disk. Rarely, however, the entire disk must be removed. In these cases, the vertebrae may need to be fused together with metal hardware to provide spinal stability. Rarely, your surgeon may suggest the implantation of an artificial disk.

Sincerely, George","Doctor":"WELCOME TO HCM!Thanks for the consult on world's best portal for online help. I can realize the health concerns you have and will help you today for the same.Well, it seems to be an issue with the intervertebral disc in the lower lumbar region. When there is a disc herniation(dislocation) or bulge, it causes the misalignment of the vertebral column. There are nerves that are coming out of the vertebrae which get disturbed by being pinched in between the two vertebrae.This causes severe pain that is all what you are having. Painkillers can only temporarily help you relieving the symptoms.For a definitive treatment go to an Orthopedist who will go for complete evaluation and an MRI will tell what actually is going on in there. Treatment then goes according to the cause.Hope I answered all the queries you had today. If you need further assistance, feel free to consult me anytime.Regards!Dr. HanifUSA"},{"Patient":"im a 36 yr old female, i really could do with some new suggestions.... i was diagnosed several years ago with ibs, i have been having severe constipation, bloating, stomach pains, night sweats, itching, lower back pains and a general feeling of unwellness on and off for several years, i have had the usual, colonoscopy and scans which were clear, (apart from gallstones - gallbladder removed 2 yrs ago) ive tried many medications which havn't worked, including many laxatives from my doctor, i can go weeks without bowel movements, when things are that bad the only thing that helps is picolax from the hospital, although im scared even that is not as effective as it once was ( had 1 sat morning another sunday morning and didnt work untill sunday evening!) ive just got back from seeing my gp again and although he's sending me for another scan, i really feel like he just said it to fob me off as he said i should try hypnotherapy, im fed up with constantly feeling so rubbish, its getting me down and its seriously impacting on my life, is there anything you could suggest that may help, i feel like im just being told oh its your ibs get on with it and that im wasting peoples time ....... many thanks for any suggestions you may have","Doctor":"Hi,Thanks for your query, an elucidate history..Since you are a known patient of IBS- C meaning constipating form, the treatment has to be directed accordingly.

Following surgery I had a lot of pain along the incision on my left side but I didn t follow up with the surgeon. Since then I ve had repeat UTI, Yeast and eColi infections, problems with edema and generally feeling unwell. Last summer I developed heat intolerance, and periodic purpuric rashes and worsening edema and painful inflammation. Then everything went over the top a few months ago after a yoga class - after hte first class I developed severe Pelvic pain and and severe inflammation then severe low back pain. I developed breathing problems and a CT showed scarring, mild hyperinflation and collapsing of previously healthy lungs. A PET showed increased uptake in spinal column. A PAP showed candida again, and obscuring inflammation. My urine output has quadrupled since last summer. My blood tests are going off the normal scale, high hemacrit and hemaglobin and I m told that inflammation shows in my liver (equal ratio in liver blood test) Now I have awful chronic diahrea, nauseau and stomach pain. I can t sleep on my lift side due to torso pain. An MRI of my pelvis raised some questions so I had a pelvic ultrasound. The radiologist reported a hydrosalpinx but the technician performing the ultrasound also showed alot of concern over something high up past fallopian tubes close to my (now irritated) scar from lap surgery. I ve been on one antibiotic after another and get some releif immediately after, but then everything comes right back worse then before. The gyn I m seeing wants to perform a salpingectomy and describes it as a small swollen watery mass in my fallopian tube. I can t imagine this tiny little mass can cause all this disturbance in my body a year and a half after my partial hysterectomy. I m very reluctant to take time off from work as my boss is irate over my being absent so often due to sickness and my gyn want me to take a week off followig surgery. On the other hand if this is the cause of all the problems I know I SHOULD DO IT! I keep questioning if this can be possible though?","Doctor":"Welcome to HCM. Probably I agree with her.

Over the last 8 mths my blood pressure has been a little high, mainly the diastolic # (122/95) I ve had a total of 3 kidney stones, but the last one I had was the largest 1.3cm and required lithotripsy to be removed. It was in my kidney for 2 years, without causing any problems. Due to the other random symptoms I was experiencing, I decided to have it removed to eliminate it as a cause to anything that was going on. Every urine specimen I gave had blood and tissue in it. Also, I will mention that I was diagnosed with asthma after my youngest child was born (2009). I had never had any symptoms prior to that. I never was happy with that diagnosis, because I know people with asthma and my symptoms didn t seem anything like theirs. The meds may have made a little difference but not a significant difference. I remember asking my pulmonary dr if there could be something with my heart causing the shortness of breath, because it felt more like my hear or diaphragm was weak and not strong enough to draw in a deep breath. Not sure if that makes sense to anyone but me though…. About 2 months ago, I started experiencing swelling in my feet. About 3 weeks ago I started experiencing intermittent nausea. Last week I started experiencing intermittent sharp chest pains and shortness of breath. I saw my dr and he did an EKG in his office. It looked good. He examined me and said he heard a possible clicking noise in my heart, so he ordered an abdominal ultrasound and ECHO. The echo came back with 1)Left Ventricular systolic function is borderline reduced 2)The estimated LV Ejection Fraction is 45-50%. 3) There is borderline global hypokinesis of the left ventricle. The ultrasound shows 1)The kidneys demonstrate mild increased echogenicity, which may be represent chronic medical renal disease, but are without evidence of suspicious solid renal mass, hydronephrosis, or shadowing stones. 2)There is a benign and simple-appearing cyst seen at the left kidney, measuring 1.5 X 2.6 X 1.3 CM. The left kidney measures 10.9 in greatest dimension, while the right kidney measures 10.1. I had a CT (w/o contract) in May of this year, just before the lithotripsy and nothing was noted or mentioned about anything with my kidneys, other than the large stone. I m worried about about an abdominal aorta aneurysm, for the cause of my heart issues, as that would explain the low back pain. When the ultrasound was done, she focused only on my upper abdomen and didn t go below my belly button. What are you thoughts on the heart impressions ? Are they symptoms of something else (like an aneurysm) or is this a condition/disease/defect itself? My grandfather died from a massive heart attach. We were told he had a thin place in the main artery to his heart, and that it was genetic, but only the males in our family needed to worry about it. Also, your thoughts on my kidney findings would be great. Does an ultrasound show better images than CT, that would explain why nothing showed on the CT I had a few months ago, or is this something that has developed this fast? :-/","Doctor":"All your symptoms suggestive of kidney involvement with systemic symptoms If u have low back ache tell me does it radiate to lower limbs?

When I went in at first they did an xray and said I was fine. I kept having muscle spasms and kept coming into the hospital. I didn t have insurance so they would nt do an mri and they labeled me a drug seeker due to other people going in for drugs. So I finally got indigent insurance and an mri was done and they found the fractures. I received an apology and an explanation. I also received a spinal tap to asparate the fracture area. So about a month goes by and I lose 50 pounds and I m sick every day so I start frequenting the hospital again and they label me as a drug seeker AGAIN! All they do is give me a bag of saline and tell me to go home and I even had to go in by ambulance a couple times because I couldn t even get off of the floor! So about a month after that I go to a hospital out of state almost incoherent and they do an xray and find staph right where the spinal tap was done(MSSA). I get flight for lifed out of state to another hospital where I am on a pick line with antibiotics for 6 weeks until my platelets drop so they had to put me on oral antibiotics for 2 weeks. I barely survived. I came back to my home state and there s obviously no apology this time because they messed up bad. So about a year goes by and my neck starts hurting bad and they mri it and find arthritis as bad as a 60 year old.

Dr. Dan Nicholson, Minesville, N.S. accepted her as a patient after she disclosed all her medical issues. On the next appointment she delivered her list of prescriptions since October 2013. He immediately dismissed her and denied her any medical services because in the past her Dr. Brown (since retired) prescribed narcotics to help her manage severe pain and lack of sleep. Dr. Nicholson did not elaborate and she left crying and feeling unwanted and unworthy. Dr. Isis Dawood who was accepting new patients also refused to accept this patient because she was a patient of a former colleague at Lacewood Medical Clinic that closed down and the doctors all moved to Ontario, including her doctor and Dr. Dawood. When her doctor returned to Nova Scotia he set up in Bedford but did not contact her. Before he left he told her he was moving and could not longer be her doctor. IN the Halifax Metro Newspaper, April 2, 2015, Tony MacIntryre tells his story of being declined by 10 physicians and some declined because he uses narcotics to control his severe pain. My two questions are: If a patient was prescribed narcotics to ease and manage their pain in the past, are there other more effective prescriptions available today that are not narcotics for her conditions? If so, what didn t or wouldn t Dr. Dan Nicholson not explain that alternative and option and try her on those?

I m a 40 year old male, straight, and married. I m in good health and just recently had my physical and my blood and urine tests. All my vitals and levels were good except that in my urine, there was an indication of few bacteria. For a couple of years now, I ve had a feeling that my prostate may be enlarging or something may be wrong. The symptoms I ve been having are as follows (which seem to be classic): 1) General pelvic sensitivity and soreness at times...not always. It comes and goes. 2) Some reduction in urination flow - for some reason I urinate more freely under a hot shower. 3) Some dribbling and stop and go during the end of urination. 4) I have a little lower backbone and back pain occasionally but not always. 5) I have mild pain during ejaculation. 6) There is NO BURNING or PAIN during urination. 7) A couple of times in the past few years, I was awakened by severe aching/pain in the rectum. I told my practitioner about this and he stated that it was due to extremely sensitive nerves in the area that were somehow irritated. But the cause was not given. 8) My body, in the last couple of weeks, has ached a little more than usual. I am still exercising and doing new workouts but I m not sure if that s the reason why. 10) I ve lost weight over the last year. HOWEVER, this has been deliberate as far as I know. I ve worked out very regularly and cut back my portions and modified my types of food I eat (less meats in general, less food in general). I ve tried to gain a little muscle mass but it s not very easy. ITEMS OF IMPORTANCE: 1) I ve come from 162 lbs at my peak in 2005 to 133 lbs now. Until about 4-5 months ago, I was 140-141 lbs but then went down to what I am currently at 133-134lbs. Essentially I ve gone back to what I used to weight when I was 25 years old. The only concern I have about this is that my loss in a few months was far more rapid. Granted, I ve really tried to lose my belly fat...and it s working...but I m hoping it s just a case of me trying and nothing else. 2) I have not lost my appetite but I simply do not eat as much as I used to. 3) I do not smoke. 4) I am a casual drinker. 5) In my family, my father passed away from complications due to diabetes. My mother has mild anxiety and high cholesterol. 6) My sister has thyroid issues and is overweight. 7) My grandmother passed from heart disease and my grandfather from old age. I have an appointment to see a Urologist on May 3rd of this year. I am hoping it s a simple case of Prosatitis and nothing more. Could you give any feedback, suggestions please?

About a year and a half ago, I started to develop a slight tremor in my left forearm/hand. Over time, the tremor has gotten more exaggerated. Just recently I have noticed that my left lower leg/foot has felt heavy and stiff and I cannot move or rotate my foot as well as my right one. I have jogged a couple of times recently and although, while running I was okay, afterwards, this caused lower back ankle/foot pain. When I stand or walk for an extended period of time, I have pain in my lower back and ankle/foot. Sometimes when turning my head quickly, I get a pinching type pain in my neck on both sides of my neck. When I sleep, the tremor goes away. When I wake up with the sensation of pins-and-needles in my arm from sleeping on it, although it is numb, as it normally would be, I have complete use of my hand and fingers, normal dexterity, without the tremor, until normal feeling comes back, usually up to about 5 minutes. The more relaxed I am, it seems, the less the tremor. But the stiffness or lack of dexterity of my fingers stays the same. Also, a drink or two of alcohol suppresses the tremor. As a twelve year old, I had scoliosis surgery, placing rods in my back, from “T-4 to the end plate of T-10 and T-11 through L-3’. Also, about 10 years ago, from a target shooting gun accident, I have a .22 caliber bullet fragments remaining in my upper left arm. At first, we thought the bullet fragments were the cause since only my lower left arm was affected but since the EMG shows normal nerve conductivity and now that my left leg seems to be affected we don’t think this is a factor.. I was told, when I had the scoliosis surgery that possibly, down the road, I could experience problems from my neck. Currently, as stated earlier, I get some neck pain and stiffness and lower back pain. Earlier, in the summer, after doing some strenuous yard work, I had acute lower back pain that lasted for several weeks. I took Skelaxin, a muscle relaxer, which helped. This is the first time I have ever had that extensive pain in my back. We have been to several different neurologists, without much success. I have had a brain MRI done, a neck MRI, 2 different EMG’s, extensive blood work and an EEG done as well. All reports are included. You will see that the Brain MRI shows normal. The EMG shows that the nerves and muscles of my lower arm are normal. The blood work and EEG are normal as well. The Neck MRI is, we believe now is the area of focus, as the report says that I have “significant reversal of the cervical lordosis and a moderate to large, right sided disc herniation at C6-C7. The neck problems seems to have been overlooked to date by doctors as originally, the diagnosis was that I had an anxiety related tremor because when I concentrated on something else, the tremor went away, briefly. Also, there was some concern from just one of the doctors that it may be Parkinson’s disease. However, most of the doctors felt that the frequency of the tremor, 10 Hz doesn’t suggest it. Also, in trying Cararbidopa-levodopa, 25-100MG tablet, which should have stopped the tremor, if it was Parkinson’s, did nothing but made me nauseous. It had no affect on the tremor. Speaking of medicines, to date, I have been prescribed the following medications with literally no results. Starting from earliest date to most recent…      Trihexyphenidyl – 2MG, taken twice daily – (this made me dizzy, headachy,weak.)      Pramipexole Dihydrochloride, (Mirapex) - .5MG, taken 1 tab, 3 times daily – (this caused       diarrhea)      Lorazepam - .5MG, taken one tab, twice daily. (this lessened the tremor slightly for just a day or two but it kept me awake).      Carbidopa-Levodopa – 25-100MG, taken 1 tab, three times daily, (Made me very       Nauseous, with no affect).      Clonazepam - .5MG tab, taken 1 tab, twice daily. (no affect) Amantadine – 100MG, taken 1 tab twice daily. (Lessened tremor for just a day or tow but then made me nauseous, headachy).      Propranolol – 20MB tabs, taken 1 tab daily. Since there was no affect, this was       Increased to 3 tabs, 3 times daily. (No affect at either dosage).      Prednizone – Tried a metered dose pack to see if it would reduce inflammation hoping       to reduce the tremor some. (There was no significant affect).       I am currently not taking any medications other than occasional Advil for pain in my lower back and neck stiffness. Additionally, I tried acupuncture for 8 appointments. While on the table, relaxing, the tremor went away, then, after getting up, the tremor came back. my newest mri of my neck is:c2-c3: unremarkable c4-c5: posterior disc bulge. Mild left uncovertebral hypertrophy. No significant central or foraminal narrowing. c5-c6: Mild posterior disc bulge. Mild right neuroforaminal narrowing. central canal is patent. c6-c7: Small right foraminal disc herniation and eccentric right uncovertebral hypertrophy causing moderate right neuroforaminal narrowing. this effaces the ventral thesal sac. there is no significant central spinal stenosis","Doctor":"hiYou may cosult spine surgeon/neurosurgeon and ask if surgery on neck for mri findings could help in relieving tremors?neck isometric exercises, cervical collar and physical therapy may also help .Fibromyalgia and multiple sclerosis should also be ruled outbest wishes"},{"Patient":"Hi, I was at my cabin this past week-end and suddenly got severe lower back pain and went into my hips and down my legs.

Dear severe lower back pain is a common feature experieced by large number of people . Apparently it  can be  caused by factors such as injury, back strain, arthritis, abuse of the back muscles ,such as from poor posture, a sagging mattress, or ill-fitting shoes , or any of a number of other disorders.  Factors such as stress, overstrain while on work , depression, fear and deep emotions can also play a crucial role. This usually comes due to overstraining of back muscles.  For such condition in my patients I would suggest to  do stretchting exercises  which involve back bending , Pranayam - deep breathing . Some of the Yogic postures like Setu bandh , Naukaasan  Bhujjangasan  are some of the few postures   also help  to  strengthen muscls & alley pain .Applying  muscle relaxants like   Relaxyl for local application. You can also give hot fomentation on back. Rest is also advised  for 3 days . Antioxidants and  vitamin C, D  in natural form , Sunlight , banana ,lemon juice  ,  Turmeric powder a level spoon  with hot milk  twice a day for a week  is helpful in alleveating pain and inflammation  .Avoid fried ,fast food , tea , coffee , alcohol , sleeplessness , dehyderation , worry , constipation .prper rest , over use of limbs without a proper rest can lead to wearing out fast If problem persists ,it is advisale to consult an ortho expertHope this helps solves your query .Take care , All the best .Don't hesitate to get back if have any further query"},{"Patient":"I have a very bad cough for about 2 weeks which has gotten worse. my whole face hurts. my ears are clogged. now my back hurts from coughing. started throwing up from lots of flem.

Also, I have had changing bowel conditions that are obviously not normal for me... ranging from what seems like constipation (albeit I went several times per day but the effort was not norm, also sometimes it felt like I had to have a bowel movement and couldn t) to current loose stool and diarrhea. It feels like the issue (pain) is coming from the bowels. So, I have been to the doctor (GP x 4, ER x 3) numerous times over the past few weeks so I will share the process so as to give you an idea where we are at. At this point (as of today), after you review the details below, I am waiting to go to a GI specialist however my condition is such that I am starting to really worry that each day I delay further treatment I am causing more damage to my body (condition and generally feeling of good health deteriorating)… 1)     4 weeks ago I visit GP for what appeared to be dark urine and or cloudy (vs. normal). Blood tests clear (tested for being anemic along with several other items such as potassium etc.). All clear for blood test. 2)     Due to visit in item # 1 there were 3 urine tests. 1st came back with more blood red cells than normal (just barely over the 0-3 count considered normal as per GP discussion).Two additional tests (one each day for 2 consecutive days) all clear for red blood cells. Due to other visits to GP and ER in notes below I have had another 3 urine tests all clear (3 of the tests were just dips and 3 were sent for microscopic tests) 3)     Due to visit in item # 1 sent for ultrasound of abdominal and chest x-ray (checked all organs except bowel and pancreas). All clear on both tests. 4)     Urine issue cleared up without any treatment. Increased my fluid intake overall so this may be the corrective action. There was discussion with GP that I had kidney stones but none found. 5)     Pain started to build across back (kidney area, I suppose) over several days and became somewhat unbearable. Pain moved around back and sometimes was higher in back and very painful (different days = pain in different locations). Visited GP again and was given pain pills as it was stated that due to the tests done so far it would not be normal to investigate any further. I was sent to physio stating that a back issue could be present. Physio confirmed there was no evidence there were any issues with my back causing bowel issues (stated it was likely the other way around). They stated I had some posture issues which they could help with but were unrelated to my acute issues. 6)     In the interim, while not prescribe by my doctor, I took some muscle relaxer (Robax Platinum) so I could function. Pills did relieve back pain. After 2 days or so taking well below the max dose allowed on package I became very weak, pale and had dropped heart rate (happened after dinner one evening). Went to ER and was put on EKG and had urine test. At visit to ER I have been off the robax for 12+ hours and ER doctor said vitals ok and the pills likely caused the problem (so, I never took another one). 7)     Visited GP the next day she did some more blood tests which were clear (I know CBC but not sure what else was checked). 8)     Pain increased over 2 days and at 11pm one night the stabbing pain in rectal/tailbone area was so back I went to the ER (could not sleep). I had a digital rectal exam done and was clear. Doctors were at a loss as to what was wrong and sent me home. I believe my age, being only 34, is impacting their decision. 9)     I returned to my GP the next day who sent me for an x-ray of tailbone which was clear. 10)     I went to the ER the following morning after another night of unbearable pain) and the ER doctor stated I likely had acute case of diviculitis and prescribed antibiotics (2 of them, taken together, for 7 days). I was also sent for a CT scan in 64-slice scanner and put through with and without contrast (IV). After reviewing the CT scan doctor reaffirmed it was diviculitis and stated “there isn’t a whole lot going on down there” (official report was non-specific inflammation) and said the drugs would wipe out any bug causing problems (albeit he still confirmed diviculistis on official report). They noticed some inflammation of lower colon and rectum but stated not significant. 11)     With the antibiotics given the pain went away and I felt ok (although a bit lightheaded and nauseous – noted on documentation that this is side effect of pills). Also, while bowel movements had now close to the correct form they were very loosely formed. Also, the stool was close to black (not quite, but dark). Since this went away after finished drugs, and my reading side effects info on this drugs, I assume it was the pills and this did not alarm me. 12)     Now that the drugs are done the pain is coming back, but it is nowhere near where it was prior to taking the pills. 13)     I was called by my GP a few days ago who wanted to follow-up on CT scan. She stated that there was wall thickening and/or inflammation possibly showing a bit near the other end of colon (starting end) as well as the rectum/lower colon as stated by the ER doctor who ordered the CT. She stated further investigation required (required protocol). She was not convinced it is diviculitis. She also mentioned something about lymph nodes irritation by inflammation/wall thickening at the starting end of colon and mentioned this was more common with Crohn s disease but didn’t think I had this since this had come on somewhat suddenly. She stated that the CT report only stated “there may be” something showing on the starting end of colon (meaning there wasn’t much showing but there could be something, as my GP put it). Blood tests sent in to check for inflammation (I have not heard back). I was called 3 days after GP visit by nurse who stated I have been referred to GI doctor and they advised them (where I am being sent) it is urgent. When I questioned the “urgent” statement by the nurse and asked if something serious was now considered she stated “no, nothing like that” (same thing GP told me) . As I type this message I am sitting here with mild rectal/tailbone pain, recent onset of bloating (not severe or painful but noticeable – this is a new issue within the last 36 hours or so), back pain (lower and mid). Diarrhea has been issue for 2 days now along with some light coloured stools that are nor formed whatsoever (along with gas). I also feel quite sluggish (although not exhausted) and warm (mild sweaty feeling) but numerous checks for fever (home test) are negative (as have all checks at ER over the past several weeks). Unfortunately, it is true we start to really worry when it comes to our health and can over-think things. Having said that, I know something is definitely wrong and I’m curious if there is more action I should be taking immediately. There is much discussion online regarding cancer and that is obviously scary for a 34 year old that, up to now, has been quite health (6’0’ 185lbs). As a side note I am still able to do my evening run of 3.5km on nights when the discomfort isn’t too bad (went last night and will go tonight). I could not do any running prior to the antibiotics due to pain. Pain seems to be gone during the exercise (or due to all the work my body is doing to run it over-rides the pain, I am not sure how that works). I usually get in 3 runs per week in the evening. Any feedback on what I should be doing to get myself back to good health would be much appreciated.","Doctor":"Hello! Good day! I read your concerns thoroughly and will break down all your problems systematically--1. tailbone pain --anatomically, the rectum (lower colon), is directly sitting on the tailbone.  Any inflammation in that area can cause discomfort or pain in the lower back, especially the tailbone (sacrum).  However, there is also a possibility that it is a separate problem, since previously you have had lower back pains.  Lower back pains can be caused by several problems-- most common is musculo-skeletal strain, other causes are kidney stones, urinary tract infection, slipped disc, scoliosis, impinged nerve.  The best diagnostic to rule out spinal bone problems in your lower back is a plain Xray of the Lumbo-sacral area (AP-Lateral views), an MRI might follow if with problem noted in the Xray.  2.  For your rectal pain, since it was already documented on your CT scan that there is thickening in the area, a sigmoidoscopy or a colonoscopy will give us a direct visualization of the problem, a biopsy of the inflamed/thickened area might also be a good idea to know the cause-- whether infectious, inflammatory bowel, auto immune, or cancer.  3. Diarrhea/constipation/bloating -- this problem is probably caused by the thickening of your bowels.  The main diagnostic that can give us an idea of what is the underlying cause will be the sigmoidoscopy/colonoscopy.4.  Sluggishness might be a symptom of dehydration secondary to your diarrhea.  I suggest you take in a lot of fluids, especially after an loose stool episode, to replenish the losses.I hope I was able to answer your concerns.  Goodluck and may you get well soon!"},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I have being suffering from lowback pain, and some numbness of toes for quite some time. There is an area just above the knees (both), parallel to the hands when when stand with arms hanging down. It is fairly a small area where the feeling is different. i have consulted many neuro and orthopaedic surgeons and taken two to three MRI images along with number of x-rays. But none of those MRI s show a severe damage to the joints L4 L5 or any other area examined. But highlighted there is a slight bulging in L4 & L5, I m a regular Badminton player for the last one & half years. When playing i don t have much of difficulties, but after sitting and doing some work, it is difficult to strighten my back with one go, it takes a while for me to settle down. In addition to that if i put my right arm back of my head or extend above the head and keep resting for a while, i find it very difficult to bring it back without the healp of the other arm. But after few movements it becomes close to normal, but have very pale pain in the shoulder joint area. Would appreciate if you could advice me on the type of problem i have and how to overcome or treat to my problem. Thank you Hussain","Doctor":"Hello Hussain!  I just read your concerns.  The pain on your lower bacj and numbness in your toes is  caused by the bulge in your L4-L5 (lumbar area).  With the description you gave me, it seems you have a nerve root compression in your back.  Nerve compressions are treated initially with physical therapy, analgesics, and warm compress.  For more severe cases, surgical intervention is suggested.  I suggest you go to the nearest rehabilitation for you to start your physical therapy-- it will greatly reduce your pain and discomfort."},{"Patient":"I have been experiencing right side lower back pain. This has been going for a while. Lately it has been severe. I am unable to walk,sit or lay down other than briefly. Pain pills of script strength have no effect muscle relaxers also have no effect.

Ibuprophen is the only thing that relieves the pain temporarily.","Doctor":"Hello!  I read your concerns.  Low back pain is commonly caused by muscle spasms which could be due to posture, heavy activity, or trauma.  However, since muscle relaxants don't work on you, it could be something else-- slipped disc, osteoarthritis, scoliosis, kidney stones, and other causes.  If I was your treating physician, I suggest you do a simple xray of your lower back to rule out spinal causes. I hope you get well soon.

I read your concerns and will try to break it down all your problems systematically.  Fever is commonly caused by an infection, the antibiotics (ciprofloxacin) he took may be not sensitive to the infection he presently has, that is why his symptoms persisted.  Aversion to food is common in patients who are ill, in your husband's case, it could narrow down the where the cause of his infection is coming from-- gut, kidneys, and liver.  The lower back pain in your husband's case is one of the clues where his infection is coming from-- kidneys, bladder, pancreas, liver.  The dark urine could be due to dehydration, since he is not taking anything orally.If I was your treating physician, I will request the following--  complete blood count, urinalysis, blood culture, kidney and liver function tests, a whole abdomen ultrasound or CT scan.  I also suggest he gets admitted during all these test in order for him to get hydrated intravenously with fluids.  Once he gets all the results, he could get treated right away.

Thanks for your question at HCM. In cuurent times, it is quite common to see back pain at young age. Most commonly it can be attributed to bad posture. But since you have back pain for more than 6 months and new onset sensation in your buttocks, I think it needs further work up. The most basic work up will include a thorough physical exam and X Ray of your spine. Further course of action will be decided based on them In the mean time,I would suggest you to go through websites on ergonomics. Ergonomics is branch of science which deals with posture adjustments according your livelihood. It will help you choose a posture most suited for your daily routine.

You can consult physiotherapist for help.Physiotherapy like ultrasound and interferential therapy will give quick relief.Hope this answers your query.

Good morning. I am Dr Shareef answering your query. If I were your doctor, I would first ask you to discontinue the Ibuprofen tab which might by all means have caused severe gastritis and peptic ulcer syndrome which gave rise to such pain.

Go for a regular exercise depending on your medical fitness. In case of no relief, or increasing problem, I am afraid you might have to see a gastro enterologist in your area irrespective of your insurance status.I hope this information would help you in discussing with your family physician/treating doctor in further management of your problem.

T1weighted, T2 weighted and inversion recovery sagittal images were obtained, in addition to axial images. At the L5/S1, there is degenerative disc disease and a large right paracentral posterior disc extrusion. The extruded disc material measures 1.5 cm in diameter and it is compressing and displacing posteriorly the right S1 nerve root as it exits the theca. There is also compression of the anterior theca but no significant compression of the left S1 nerve root. At L3/L4 level, there is a very small left paracentral posterior annular disc tear and bulge. No significant thecal or nerve root compression is seen at this level. The signal intensity and height of this disc are preserved. No abnormality of the remaining lumbar inverterbral discs has been demonstrated. No intrathecal abnormality is seen. There is a mild scoliosis of the lumber spine convex to the left. Conclusion: 1. At L5/S1level, there is degenerative disc disease and a large right paracentral posterior disc extrusion as described. 2. Very small left paracentral posterior annular disc tear at the L3/L4 level. 3. Mild scoliosis,","Doctor":"Since you have persistent numbness and tingling over the feet and you recovered from an acute sciatica, its better to avoid exercising now. You can start spine extension exercises after the pain and everything is gone for at least 3 weeks.

She woke yesterday to some back pain by the time she drove to school it was excruciating. She turned around to come home and threw up on the way. She came into the house screaming for me to take her to the hospital. She has NEVER been in this kind of pain before. She has chronic pain due to Henoch–Schönlein purpura. She was diagnosed with it three years ago and has had ongoing issues with arthralgia, vasculitis, and protein in her urine. I took her to the ER and the Dr on duty did not even physically examine her. Her pain was on her back on left side and a little on the right. She was yelling out in pain and vomited 4 times total. She was given a shot of Demerol and the Dr told us that she had a muscle spasm on the way to school due to the cold weather. He ran a urine test right before we left and it came back that she had a UTI. The dr gave her a three day dose of Bactrim and said that the UTI didn t cause her pain. She isn t hurting as bad today but is still dizzy and nauseated. I have been trying to get her rheumatologist to call me but have not gotten a call back. I m really afraid a three day supply of Bactrim won t be enough or that this is more than just a UTI (she has no pain or burning when urinating and doesn t have to urinate often). Should I be concerned? Should I take her some place else?","Doctor":"Please give her lots of water ( may be with little lemon juice) to flush out any turbidity in urinary tract.As a harmless relief for nausea, give her cardamomum seeds to chew and suck off and on. If 2 cloves are boiled in 100 ml water for sometime, let cool and this water drunk, it also controls vomiting. Mint leaves juice ( by grinding and extracting) few drops to 1/2 tsp also controls vomiting. You have all options open.For pain I would not suggest any antiinflammatory as far as possible since it may cause gastritis and induce vomiting. Try some external massage for muscular pains until its unbearable and internal pain killer has to be taken.Now finally, give her little turmeric powder say 1/4 to 1/2 tsp in warm water or milk( even if she throws it, give again). There are capsules named HARIDRA (which contains turmeric) by Himalaya co., may be arranged instead. It will serve multiple purpose. It's natural anti bacterial, pain killer and anti allergic. It works in purpura too.All these things will only benefit additionally, will not interact with other medicines.When you are clear about tests etc, we may advise further too.

Im just confused.","Doctor":"For treatment of back pain you can take some pain killer like biozobid-plus or osteonac-th only when the pain is worse enough or disturbing your daily work along with some calcium supplements like shalcal-d or toscal-gem once daily. Use volidup or relax gel for local application. Do some exercises after an expert opinion of physiotherapist.

I have nausea vaginal and lower back pain blood tests are elevated and they dont know why","Doctor":"Better, had you informed elevated blood reports to enable me to comment better.For the conditions presented and given scenario, you must have had many medicines. These did not work. It's better option for you to switch to naturals and assess for few weeks. My other patients get benefit by this approach.If I were your doctor, I would have given you turmeric powder to drink 1/2 tsp in warm water or milk for few days irrespective of what your blood reports say. This cures back pain, disinfects. Cardamomum seeds CHEWING will control your nausea. If you get anhydrous alum powdered ( Shubhra bhasm) and wash vagina with it, vagina pain is controlled.No side effects, no interactions with any med. If I get value of blood work, I may suggest few other things too.Hope it helps."},{"Patient":"Here lately I have been feeling really bloated and having really bad nausea.

I have pain in my lower back and my chronic headaches are far more frequent. I just took an OTC test and it immediately came up negative.

If all the factors are normal e.g. hormonal balance, Hb level, proper internal uterine lining i.e. without any lesion, cyst etc the shedding of endometrium is regularly intervened by nature. That's what's called regular periods.If irregular, factors above are tried to bring to normal using the support of drugs or herbs.My recommendation is herbal medicine. Generally I give Evecare and Liquid Ashokarishta to my own patients for 4-8 weeks for regularising the periods. These also replenish Hb level, balance hormones, manage lumbago etc associated with gynae.Hope it helps."},{"Patient":"It seems like everytime I drink a glass of red wine or take the Reversatrol with wine Extract, I have alot of pressure on my lower back a few days later.

I take 1 MG of clonazepam and 1 trazodone TAB 100MG to sleep. I have meloxicam 7.5 MG. tramadol HCL 50 MG. Cyclobenzapaprine 10MG, Gabapentin 100 MG, and methocarbamol 750MG which I don t want to take. I am not sure which I should take. Would it be safe to take the tramadol and the cyclobenzaprine 10 MG together with my sleep medication ??","Doctor":"Hi there.It is better to be cautious of lower back pain as this could result from nerve pinching in the back. Get an Orthopaedician consult and your Doctor may advise you for X-ray or MRI as necessary to find the cause. If you have a pinched nerve, you could get other forms of pain management like Epidural steroid injection as advised by your Doctor. This will offer better long term relief and less need for oral medication. Avoid bending forwards, lifting heavy weights. Wear a lumbar belt for support whle sitting or standing. Apply pain killer muscle relaxant gel. Apply hot water bag carefully over the region of the pain as this helps to reduce pain and muscle spasm."},{"Patient":"Hi, I m suffering so much from a accident 3 years ago!

So get in urine culture for confirmation.However, there are so many other causes of such pain on this side as epididmo-orchitis ( if you are male ) , while if you are female then fallopian tube infection may be the one such cause ( salpingitis ).So in my opinion consult a physician and get his opinion as physical examination as well clinical and history of illness is important.Good luck."},{"Patient":"Hi, I had open myomectomy like 3 weeks ago, I bleed for a few days afterwards and then brownish mucous like discharge, followed by my period 2 weeks after surgery.

No side effects, totally safe.Step 1. Warm water in which Holy basil leaves and little Ginger or ginger powder is boiled. Drink small cups daily 3-4 times.Step 2.

If no  leaves are found -skip it.Step 3. Get Rumalya DS tablets. And Medohar guggul  with warm water. These both for wt shedding and pains.Step 4 Rumalya liniment or gel gentle massage over back.Step 5. Crohns disease. Get BAEL (golden apple, wood apple etc) pulp dry powder, Kutajghan Vati both with warm water daily.if you do not boil ginger at point 1, please add ginger powder 1/2 tsp with BAEL powder.These are very economic. Do not think of insurance cover. Very easy to take once you get it. Try on the net. We may also help you to find if you can't find.Please start it and continue for four weeks initially.
