For positive reals with x>y, we shall write Q(x, y) for the relation:f(f(x)+P(y))=f(x-y)+2 y1. Step 1. f(x) geq x. Assume that this is not true. Since P(0)=0 and P is with non-negative coefficients, P(x)+x is surjective on positive reals. If f(x) < x, then there exists a positive real y such that f(x) = x - y. By Q(x, y), we get:f(f(x)+P(y))=f(x-y)+2 ySince f(x) = x - y, we have f(x-y) = f(f(x)+P(y)) geq f(x) + P(y) geq f(x) + 2y. Therefore, f(x-y) geq f(x). We get f(y) geq f(2y) geq cdots geq f(ny) geq ny for all positive integers n, which is a contradiction.2. Step 2. If c neq 0, then f(f(x)+2z+c^2) = f(x+1) + 2(z-1) + 2c for z > 1. Indeed, by Q(f(x+z) + cz, c), we get:f(f(f(x+z) + cz) + c^2) = f(f(x+z) + cz - c) + 2c = f(x+1) + 2(z-1) + 2cOn the other hand, by Q(x+z, z), we have:f(x) + 2z + c^2 = f(f(x+z) + P(z)) + c^2 = f(f(x+z) + cz) + c^2Substituting in the LHS of Q(f(x+z) + cz, c), we get f(f(x) + 2z + c^2) = f(x+1) + 2(z-1) + 2c.3. Step 3. There is x_0 such that f(x) is linear on (x_0, infty). If c neq 0, then by Step 2, fixing x=1, we get f(f(1) + 2z + c^2) = f(2) + 2(z-1) + 2c which implies that f is linear for z > f(1) + 2 + c^2. As for the case c=0, consider y, z in (0, infty). Pick x > max(y, z), then by Q(x, x-y) and Q(x, x-z) we get:f(y) + 2(x-y) = f(f(x)) = f(z) + 2(x-z)which proves that f(y) - 2y = f(z) - 2z and therefore f is linear on (0, infty).4. Step 4. P(y) = y and f(x) = x on (x_0, infty). By Step 3, let f(x) = ax + b on (x_0, infty). Since f takes only positive values, a geq 0. If a=0, then by Q(x+y, y) for y > x_0 we get:2y + f(x) = f(f(x+y) + P(y)) = f(b + cy)Since the LHS is not constant, we conclude c neq 0, but then for y > x_0 / c, we get that the RHS equals b which is a contradiction.Hence a > 0. Now for x > x_0 and x > (x_0 - b) / a large enough by P(x+y, y) we get:ax + b + 2y = f(x) + 2y = f(f(x+y) + P(y)) = f(ax + ay + b + cy) = a(ax + ay + b + cy) + b.Comparing the coefficients before x, we see a^2 = a and since a neq 0, a = 1. Now 2b = b and thus b = 0. Finally, equalizing the coefficients before y, we conclude 2 = 1 + c and therefore c = 1.Now we know that f(x) = x on (x_0, infty) and P(y) = y. Let y > x_0. Then by Q(x+y, x) we conclude:f(x) + 2y = f(f(x+y) + P(y)) = f(x + y + y) = x + 2yTherefore f(x) = x for every x. Conversely, it is straightforward that f(x) = x and P(y) = y do indeed satisfy the conditions of the problem."},{"problem":"The center of the circle inscribed in a quadrilateral lies on its diagonal, which is equal to 5.

Let's split the problem into two cases.- Case 1: a=bThe equation simplifies into 2^{p} cdot a^{p}=2 cdot p^{a}, and since 4left|2^{p}, 2right| p^{a} which implies that p=2. Plugging this new piece of information into the initial equation yields 4 a^{2}=2^{a+1} so a^{2}=2^{a-1}. If a>1, then a has to be even since 2^{a-1} is even. However, on the other hand, since a^{2} is a perfect square, 2^{a-1} has to be a perfect square as well, so a must also be odd, which is a contradiction. Thus, the only option is a=1 which indeed satisfies the initial equation. Thus, out of this case, we obtain one solution: (a, b, p)=(1,1,2).- Case 2: a neq bSince the equation is symmetric in a and b, assume wlog b>a. Now, the equation can be rewritten as(a+b)^{p}=p^{a}left(1+p^{b-a}right)Therefore, p mid(a+b)^{p}, so p mid a+b. Now, look at the prime factorization of both sides of the equation and consider the powers of p. The right side of the equation is p^{a} times a number not divisible by p, because b-a>0. If (a+b)^{p}=p^{x} cdot y where y is not divisible by p, then p mid x. Thus, we have p mid a, because x=a. Combining this with p mid a+b, we deduce that p mid a, b. Now, to conclude, observe that p^{a}left(1+p^{b-a}right) is a perfect p-th power, and since p^{a} is a perfect p-th power and is coprime to 1+p^{b-a}, we get that 1+p^{b-a} is a p-th power. Write 1+p^{b-a}=z^{p}, and since p mid b-a and b-a>0, we get that z^{p}-p^{b-a}=1 which is a contradiction because the difference of 2 different perfect p-th powers is at least 2^{p}-1>1.

Therefore, the numerator (x_1 - x_2)(1 - x_1 x_2) < 0, and the denominator is always positive because it is the product of sums of squares. Thus, f(x_1) - f(x_2) < 0 Rightarrow f(x_1) < f(x_2).It follows that the function f(x) is strictly increasing on the interval (-1, 1).(III) To solve the inequality f(2x - 1) + f(x) < 0, we can use the following approach, based on the monotonicity we have just established. We are looking for values of x such that f(2x - 1) < -f(x). Given the function is odd, this translates to f(2x - 1) < f(-x).Since f(x) is strictly increasing, 2x - 1 < -x must be true in order for f(2x - 1) < f(-x). Solving 2x - 1 < -x for x, we get:3x < 1 Rightarrow x < frac{1}{3}.Given the domain constraints of f(x), namely -1 < 2x-1 < 1 and -1 < x < 1, we can combine this with the inequality 2x-1 < -x to get the solution set:boxed{0 < x < frac{1}{3}}.Thus, the solution of the inequality f(2x - 1) + f(x) < 0 is the interval left(0, frac{1}{3}right)."},{"problem":"5 cdot 4 natural numbers a_{1}, a_{2}, cdots, a_{49} have a sum of 999, let d be the greatest common divisor of a_{1}, a_{2}, cdots, a_{49}, what is the maximum value of d?(Kiev Mathematical Olympiad, 1979)","solution":"[Solution] Since d=left(a_{1}, a_{2}, cdots, a_{49}right), thend mid a_{1}+a_{2}+cdots+a_{49}=999 text {. }That is, d is a divisor of 999=3^{3} cdot 37.Also, becausethenbegin{aligned}d mid a_{k}, quad k & =1,2, cdots, 49, a_{k} & geqslant d .end{aligned}Therefore, there must be 999=a_{1}+a_{2}+cdots+a_{49} geqslant 49 d,d leqslant frac{999}{49}<21 text {. }Furthermore, since d is a divisor of 999, d can only be 1,3,9.Also, because 999 can be written as the sum of 49 numbers.underbrace{9+9+cdots+9}_{48 uparrow}+567=999 .Each of these numbers can be divided by 9, so the maximum value of d is 9."},{"problem":"If quadrilateral ABCD satisfies overrightarrow{AB} = 2overrightarrow{DC} and (overrightarrow{CD} - overrightarrow{CA}) cdot overrightarrow{AB} = 0, then this quadrilateral must beA: RectangleB: Right-angled trapezoidC: Isosceles trapezoidD: Parallelogram","solution":"According to overrightarrow{AB} = 2overrightarrow{DC},  the opposite sides of quadrilateral ABCD are parallel and not equal, hence quadrilateral ABCD is a trapezoid.

Therefore, the flight path plane is also perpendicular to S_{2}, since the velocity vector (and tangent) at Oslo is in S_{1}, and if a plane contains a line perpendicular to another plane, then the two planes are perpendicular to each other.This means that the projection of S_{1} onto S_{2} is a straight line. Since F is also in S_{1} and its projection onto S_{2} is itself, the projection of the plane's path lies on the diameter of the meridian in S_{2} starting from Oslo (Figure 2).![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_05_02_b5c28cb7f5aafc9c978cg-1.jpg?height=618&width=569&top_left_y=1602&top_left_x=759)Figure 2The plane S_{3} of the Equator, which contains X and is perpendicular to S_{2}, is also perpendicular to the Earth's E ́ F axis and passes through F; thus, the projection of the Equator is the diameter of the meridian in Oslo perpendicular to E ́ F.

The answer did not require the geographical latitude of Oslo, so the same answer would apply if we had mentioned any other point on Oslo's meridian, such as Lübeck, Augsburg, or Cabinda, Angola.2. If the points P_{0}, P_{1}, P_{2}, ldots, P_{n-1}, P_{n} are given on a plane, then by the triangle inequality, it can be shown that the length of the P_{0} P_{n} segment cannot be greater than the sum of the lengths of the segments P_{0} P_{1}, P_{1} P_{2}, ldots, P_{n-1} P_{n}. This is why we say that the shortest path between two points is a straight line. Those who think that by connecting the points P_{i-1}, P_{i} with segments, we implicitly used the statement, should complete the statement by saying that the straight line is the shortest among all paths consisting of (and a finite number of) straight segments. And for those who want to extend the statement to other types of paths, they must first define the length of those paths. And what they want to get rid of, the length of curves is usually approximated by broken lines tangent to them.These are the things to keep in mind for those who are looking for the shortest path between two points on a sphere. We can say that the \\"segment\\" defined by two points is the shorter arc of the great circle passing through the two points - if the two points are not antipodal points of the sphere. (If the points are antipodal, we do not define the \\"segment\\" passing between them.)Let's examine whether the planar statement can be extended to this case. The number of points can be reduced step by step to two, if we have already proven the statement for n=2. This is the triangle inequality, which can be reduced to the fact that in a triangle, the larger side is opposite the larger angle. This can lead to some confusion, as the sides of the triangles are actually angles, arcs, and the angles of the triangles are the angles between the planes containing the sides, which is not easily visible in space. But perhaps precisely because of this, it can be useful to practice thinking through what can be transferred from the geometry of planar triangles to spherical geometry. Those who do this will find that it is more convenient to generalize the theorems to be proven and show that they can be derived from each other without referring to the specific content of the concepts involved, and using more properties of the geometric elements than those provided by the theorems in question.The planar triangle inequalities can be shown by reflecting over the angle bisector: if A C > B C, then reflecting B over the angle bisector t at C, it lands on the segment A C.![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_05_02_b5c28cb7f5aafc9c978cg-2.jpg?height=675&width=637&top_left_y=1039&top_left_x=728)Figure 3If we denote the new position of B by B^{prime}, then we only need to use the fact that the exterior angle at B^{prime} in the triangle A B B^{prime} is greater than the interior angle at A. In space, t corresponds to the half-plane bisector of the angles between the \\"sides\\" A C and B C, and reflecting B over this, we indeed get the internal point B^{prime} on the arc A C.![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_05_02_b5c28cb7f5aafc9c978cg-3.jpg?height=897&width=832&top_left_y=137&top_left_x=625)Thus, it remains to decide whether the statement about the exterior angle is true. In the plane, more is true: the exterior angle is equal to the sum of the two non-adjacent interior angles, and the sum of the angles is 180^{circ}. This is not true on the sphere at all: for \\"small\\", planar-like spherical triangles, the deviation is not large, but we have excluded antipodal pairs so far. It is noticeably the parallel lines that cause the confusion, or rather, the fact that the \\"segments\\" we are considering are contained in \\"lines\\" that intersect at two points (Figures 3-4).This is the point where we stop the examination of the question. Perhaps it is more useful to pose new problems related to spherical geometry."},{"problem":"The Amaco Middle School bookstore sells pencils costing a whole number of cents.

Substitution: Let us substitute ( y = 1 ) into the inequality:   [   f(x cdot 1) le 1 cdot f(x) + f(1) implies f(x) le f(x) + f(1)   ]   This inequality is always true and does not provide new information. However, it does not contradict our claim.3. Non-negativity: Next, we substitute ( y = -1 ):   [   f(x cdot (-1)) le (-1) f(x) + f(-1) implies f(-x) le -f(x) + f(-1)   ]   Let ( x = 1 ):   [   f(-1) le -f(1) + f(-1) implies 0 le -f(1)   ]   This implies ( f(1) ge 0 ).4.

Minimum Parts Scenario: When the three planes are all parallel, they divide the space in a manner similar to how a stack of papers might be divided by inserting dividers. Each new plane adds one additional section to the space. With three planes, the initial space is divided into two parts by the first plane, and then each subsequent plane adds one more part. Therefore, the calculation for the minimum number of parts, x, is as follows:   - Initial space: 1 part   - After 1st plane: 1 + 1 = 2 parts   - After 2nd plane: 2 + 1 = 3 parts   - After 3rd plane: 3 + 1 = 4 parts   Thus, x = 4.2. Maximum Parts Scenario: When the three planes are perpendicular to each other in pairs, they divide the space most efficiently into separate regions. This scenario is akin to cutting a cube into smaller cubes, where each plane cuts through the volume in a different dimension.

From the two equations written, we see that the square of both three-digit numbers is six-digit, so the value of A and C as the leading digits of the bases must be at least 3. According to the condition, different letters represent different digits, and the last digit of the square of A and C as the bases ends in B and F, respectively, so neither A nor C can be 5 or 6. Therefore, the possible values of A and C are3,4,7,8,9the endings of their squares are respectively9,6,9,4,1these give the possible values of B and F.The last two digits of a square number are not affected by the digit in the hundreds place of the base, so in the first equation, we can examine the relationship between BC and FB without knowing the value of A.From the first equation, we see that the value of B is given by the last digit of the square of C, for example, if C=7, then B=9, BC=97. The value of FB can be calculated by squaring: FB=09; then BF=90, which, according to the second equation, is the two-digit ending of the square of BA. However, there is no square number ending in 90, so this cannot be a solution to the problem.Let's take the possible values of BC in order. According to (3) and (4), these are 93, 64, 97 (which we have already examined), 48, 19. The endings of their squares are: 49,96,09,04,61. The reverse order of the remaining 94,69,40 and 16 is that 94 and 40 are not square endings, because if the last digit of a square number is 0, then 0 also stands before it, and if the last digit is 4, then an even digit stands before it.

This is a contradiction for B.In the other case, ABC=419, CBA=914. Similarly to the previous, the last two digits of BA^{2} are BF=96, and the last two digits of BC^{2} are FB=61, which is again a contradiction for B.In summary, the problem has only one solution, as we have seen: A=3, B=6, C=4, D=1, E=2 and F=9.II. solution. The two-digit ending of the two squares is the reverse of each other. Based on this, we can narrow down the number of endings to be examined. For this purpose, we show that after the ending of 25^{2}, no new two-digit ending of square numbers is found, the previously found ones are repeated in reverse order, and after 50^{2}, the segment between 1^{2} and 50^{2} is repeated.Indeed, if x is an integer and 0 leq x leq 25, then 50 geq 50-x geq 25, and the two-digit ending of (50-x)^{2} is the same as that of x^{2}, because their difference is:(50-x)^{2}-x^{2}=50(50-2 x)=100(25-x)on the other hand(50+x)^{2}-x^{2}=50(50+2 x)=100(25+x)both are divisible by 100, and this proves our statements.Among the 22 different endings up to 25^{2}, the two-digit endings formed from different digits and their reverses are 16 and 61, as well as 69 and 96. These first appear in the squares of 4 and 19, and 13 and 14, respectively, so according to the previousldots 16 ends with the ... 04, ldots 46, ldots 54, ldots 96 numbers squaredldots 61 ends with the ... 19, ldots 31, ldots 69, ldots 81 numbers squaredldots 69 ends with the ... 13, ldots 37, ldots 63, ldots 87 numbers squaredldots 96 ends with the ... 14, ldots 36, ldots 64, ldots 86 numbers squared.Among the endings of the bases found this way, more can be ruled out based on the following two observations. In both (1) and (2), the ending of the base is different from that of its square, the tens digit of the base is repeated in the two-digit ending of its square, in (1) in the second digit of the ending, and in (2) in the first digit of the ending.In (5), we marked with bold digits the endings of the bases that correspond to these, the ones marked with ordinary digits cannot provide a solution.

Identify the stopping condition:   Solarin stops picking cards when the sum of the numbers on the cards in his hand exceeds 124. Therefore, the possible sums he can get are 125, 126, and 127.4. Analyze the possible sums:   - Sum = 125:     To get a sum of 125, the sum of the numbers on the cards picked must be 125. This means the last card picked must be 2 (since 127 - 2 = 125).   - Sum = 126:     To get a sum of 126, the sum of the numbers on the cards picked must be 126.

This means the number of male students in the sample is proportional to the number of male students in the entire grade. Let's denote the sample size as n. The proportion of male students in the grade is frac{310}{600}, and this should be equal to the proportion of male students in the sample, which is frac{31}{n}.Setting up the equation based on this proportion, we have:[n times frac{310}{310 + 290} = 31]Simplifying this equation:[n times frac{310}{600} = 31]Further simplifying:[n times frac{31}{60} = 31]To solve for n, we multiply both sides of the equation by frac{60}{31}:[n = 31 times frac{60}{31}]Simplifying the right side of the equation:[n = 60]Therefore, the sample size is boxed{60}.

Substituting the formulas for expectation and variance of xi, we get:- 3np + 2 = 9.2- 9np(1-p) = 12.963. Solving the System of Equations:Solving the system of equations:[begin{align*}3np + 2 &= 9.2 9np(1-p) &= 12.96end{align*}]From the first equation, we can express n in terms of p:[np = frac{9.2 - 2}{3} = frac{7.2}{3} = 2.4]Substituting np = 2.4 into the second equation:[9 cdot 2.4 cdot (1-p) = 12.96]Solving for p, we find:[2.4(1-p) = frac{12.96}{9} = 1.44][1-p = frac{1.44}{2.4} = 0.6][p = 0.4]Substituting p = 0.4 back into np = 2.4 gives us n = frac{2.4}{0.4} = 6.Therefore, we have n = 6 and p = 0.4, which corresponds to statement B being correct.4. Calculating Probabilities:- For P(xi = 0), we use the formula for the probability of getting 0 successes in a binomial distribution:[P(xi = 0) = (1-p)^n = 0.6^6]- For P(xi geqslant 1), we use the complement rule:[P(xi geqslant 1) = 1 - P(xi = 0) = 1 - 0.6^6]Since n = 6 and p = 0.4 match statement B, and P(xi = 0) = 0.6^6 matches statement D, the correct choices are boxed{BD}."},{"problem":"Example 4 In triangle A B C, A B=A C, angle A= 20^{circ}, D is a point on A C, angle D B C=60^{circ}, E is a point on A B, angle E C B=30^{circ}.

From the given conditions, we can set up the following system of equations:1. If each teacher takes 38 students, there are 6 students left without a teacher, which gives us the equation: 38x + 6 = y.2. If each teacher takes 40 students, one teacher is short of 6 students, leading to the equation: 40x - 6 = y.Solving this system of equations, we get:- From 38x + 6 = y and 40x - 6 = y, setting them equal to each other gives 38x + 6 = 40x - 6.- Simplifying, we find 12 = 2x, which leads to x = 6.- Substituting x = 6 into one of the original equations, for example, 38x + 6 = y, we get 38 cdot 6 + 6 = y, which simplifies to y = 234.Therefore, there are boxed{6 text{ teachers and 234 students}} participating in the practice activity.# Part 2: Number of Cars NeededGiven that each car must have at least 1 teacher, the maximum number of cars is equal to the number of teachers, which is 6.

Solving for Each Variable:   - For left(a-16right)^{2}=0, solving for a gives a-16=0 Rightarrow a=16.   - For sqrt{b-27}=0, solving for b gives b-27=0 Rightarrow b=27.   - For |c-2|=0, solving for c gives c-2=0 Rightarrow c=2.3. Substituting the Values into the Expression:   Substituting a=16, b=27, and c=2 into the expression (sqrt{a}-sqrt[3]{b})^{c}, we get:   [   (sqrt{16}-sqrt[3]{27})^{2} = (sqrt{16}-sqrt[3]{27})^{2}.   ]4. Simplifying the Expression:   Simplifying inside the parentheses first:   [   sqrt{16} = 4, quad text{and} quad sqrt[3]{27} = 3.   ]   Therefore, the expression becomes:   [   (4-3)^{2} = (1)^{2} = 1.   ]5. Conclusion:   The value of the expression (sqrt{a}-sqrt[3]{b})^{c}, given the initial equation, is boxed{1}."},{"problem":"Given that the solution set of the inequality ax^{2}+bx+2 gt 0 is {xleft|right.-1 lt x lt 2}, then the solution set of the inequality 2x^{2}+bx+a lt 0 is ( )A: left{{x|{-1＜x＜frac{1}{2}}}right}B: {x|x lt -1，or x gt frac{1}{2}}C: {xleft|right.-2 lt x lt 1}D: {xleft|right.x lt -2，or x gt 1}","solution":"Given the inequality ax^{2}+bx+2 > 0 has a solution set of {x | -1 < x < 2}, we can deduce several things about the coefficients a, b, and the constant term in the quadratic equation.First, since the solution set is between -1 and 2, these are the roots of the equation when it is equal to 0, i.e., ax^{2}+bx+2=0. This implies that the parabola opens downwards because the interval where the quadratic expression is positive is between the two roots, indicating a < 0.Given the roots are -1 and 2, we can use Vieta's formulas, which relate the sum and product of the roots of a quadratic equation to its coefficients. Specifically, for a quadratic equation ax^2 + bx + c = 0, the sum of the roots r_1 and r_2 is given by -(b/a), and the product is c/a.Thus, we have:- The sum of the roots: -1 + 2 = 1 = -frac{b}{a}- The product of the roots: (-1) times 2 = -2 = frac{2}{a}From the sum of the roots, we get -frac{b}{a} = 1, and from the product, frac{2}{a} = -2. Solving these equations gives us a = -1 and b = 1.Substituting a = -1 and b = 1 into the second inequality 2x^{2}+bx+a < 0, we get 2x^{2}+x-1 < 0.To find the solution set of this inequality, we need to determine the intervals where 2x^{2}+x-1 is negative. Factoring or using the quadratic formula to solve 2x^{2}+x-1 = 0 gives us the roots of the equation, which are the critical points dividing the intervals on the real number line.Solving 2x^{2}+x-1 = 0 gives us the roots x = -1 and x = frac{1}{2}. Since the coefficient of x^2 is positive, the parabola opens upwards, meaning the expression 2x^{2}+x-1 is negative between the two roots.Therefore, the solution set of the inequality 2x^{2}+x-1 < 0 is {x | -1 < x < frac{1}{2}}.Hence, the correct answer is boxed{A}."},{"problem":"Example 5.

We took ten consecutive natural numbers greater than 1, multiplied them, found all the prime divisors of the resulting number, and multiplied these prime divisors (taking each exactly once). What is the smallest number that could have resulted? Fully justify your answer.Solution. We will prove that among ten consecutive numbers, there must be a number that has a prime divisor different from 2, 3, 5, 7. Let's count how many of the ten consecutive numbers can have the specified four divisors. Out of ten numbers, exactly five are divisible by 2, and at least one of these five numbers is divisible by 3. (This fact can be taken for granted in the work, but let's recall one possible proof. The remainders from dividing six consecutive numbers by 6 form a set from 0 to 5, i.e., there is a number with a remainder of 0, which is divisible by both 2 and 3.) Further, the set of ten numbers contains at least three and no more than four numbers that are divisible by 3. If there are three such numbers, at least one of these three is divisible by 2 and has already been counted. If there are four such numbers, they have the form 3k, 3k+3, 3k+6, 3k+9. Depending on the parity of k, either 3k, 3k+6 or 3k+3, 3k+9 are divisible by 2. Thus, when considering numbers divisible by 3, we can add no more than two new numbers to the five even numbers already counted. Ten consecutive numbers contain exactly two numbers that are divisible by 5, one of which is even and has already been counted. Therefore, divisibility by 5 adds no more than one number to the seven already counted. Among ten consecutive numbers, no more than two are divisible by 7, one of which is even and has already been counted. Divisibility by 7 adds no more than one number to the eight already counted. Thus, among ten consecutive numbers, no more than nine have at least one of the divisors 2, 3, 5, 7, i.e., there is a number with a larger prime divisor and not divisible by any of the first four prime numbers. Therefore, in the product of ten numbers, there will be at least one divisor different from 2, 3, 5, 7, so the product of all prime divisors will be greater than 210. The smallest possible product is 2 cdot 3 cdot 5 cdot 7 cdot 11 = 2310.","solution":"Answer: 2310.## Municipal Stage of the All-Russian Mathematics Olympiad 2018-2019 Academic Year10th GradeGrading Criteria| Score | Points for || :---: | :---: | :--- || 7 | Complete solution, a correct algorithm of actions for Zhenya is provided, and all conditions are verified. || 6 | Complete solution, a correct algorithm of actions for Zhenya is provided, but it is not verified that the arrangement obtained by the algorithm satisfies all conditions. || 4 | An algorithm of actions for Zhenya is constructed, based on dividing the cells into pairs.

What is the largest possible prime factor of overline{abc}","solution":"1. We start with the given condition that overline{abc} is a three-digit number where a, b, and c are nonzero digits, and a^2 + b^2 = c^2. This implies that (a, b, c) forms a Pythagorean triplet.2. We need to find the largest possible prime factor of overline{abc}, which is a number of the form 100a + 10b + c.3. First, identify the possible Pythagorean triplets where a, b, and c are digits (i.e., between 1 and 9). The possible triplets are:   - (3, 4, 5) because 3^2 + 4^2 = 5^2   - (4, 3, 5) because 4^2 + 3^2 = 5^24. Construct the numbers overline{abc} from these triplets:   - For (3, 4, 5), the number is 345.   - For (4, 3, 5), the number is 435.5. Determine the prime factors of each number:   - For 345:     [     345 = 3 times 115 = 3 times 5 times 23     ]     The prime factors are 3, 5, and 23.   - For 435:     [     435 = 3 times 145 = 3 times 5 times 29     ]     The prime factors are 3, 5, and 29.6.

This implies that a=b because sides opposite equal angles in a triangle are equal.6. Given overrightarrow{CA} cdot overrightarrow{CB}=1, we can express this dot product in terms of the sides of the triangle as abcos C=1. Using the Law of Cosines, we also know that a^2+b^2-c^2=2abcos C.7. Substituting c=2 and a=b, we find that 2abcos C=a^2+b^2-c^2=2. This leads us to conclude that a=b=sqrt{3}.8. Calculating cos C as frac{1}{ab}=frac{1}{3}, we then find sin C using the Pythagorean identity sin^2 C + cos^2 C = 1. This gives us sin C=sqrt{1-cos^2 C}=frac{2sqrt{2}}{3}.9. Finally, the area of triangle ABC is given by frac{1}{2}absin C. Substituting a=b=sqrt{3} and sin C=frac{2sqrt{2}}{3}, we get the area as sqrt{2}.Therefore, the area of triangle ABC is boxed{sqrt{2}}."},{"problem":"Provide a polynomial p with rational coefficients such that p(sqrt{2}+sqrt{3})=sqrt{2}.","solution":"I. solution. According to the binomial theorem:(sqrt{2}+sqrt{3})^{n}=sum_{i=0}^{n}binom{n}{i} sqrt{2}^{i} sqrt{3}^{n-i}Notice that if n is odd, then each term in the above sum is of the form a_{i} cdot sqrt{2} (if i is odd) or a_{i} cdot sqrt{3} (if i is even), where for every 0 leq i leq n, a_{i} is an integer. Expand (sqrt{2}+sqrt{3})^{n} for n=1 and n=3, trusting that from the resulting equations we can express sqrt{2} as a rational combination of (sqrt{2}+sqrt{3})^{1} and (sqrt{2}+sqrt{3})^{3}:begin{aligned}& (sqrt{2}+sqrt{3})^{1}=sqrt{2}+sqrt{3} & (sqrt{2}+sqrt{3})^{3}=2 sqrt{2}+6 sqrt{3}+9 sqrt{2}+3 sqrt{3}=11 sqrt{2}+9 sqrt{3}end{aligned}From comparing the two equations, we getsqrt{2}=frac{(sqrt{2}+sqrt{3})^{3}-9 cdot(sqrt{2}+sqrt{3})}{2}Thus, the polynomialp(x)=frac{1}{2} x^{3}-frac{9}{2} xwith rational coefficients is a solution to the problem, since according to the above, p(sqrt{2}+sqrt{3})=sqrt{2}.II. solution. Since (sqrt{2}+sqrt{3})^{2}=5+2 sqrt{6}, sqrt{6} can be expressed in the form q(sqrt{2}+sqrt{3}), where q is a polynomial with rational coefficients, specifically: q(x)=frac{x^{2}-5}{2}. If x=sqrt{2}+sqrt{3}, thenx cdot frac{x^{2}-5}{2}=(sqrt{2}+sqrt{3}) cdot sqrt{6}=sqrt{12}+sqrt{18}=2 sqrt{3}+3 sqrt{2}Using the equation x=sqrt{2}+sqrt{3}, we getsqrt{2}=2 sqrt{3}+3 sqrt{2}-2 cdot(sqrt{2}+sqrt{3})=x cdot frac{x^{2}-5}{2}-2 x=frac{1}{2} x^{3}-frac{9}{2} xThus, the polynomialp(x)=frac{1}{2} x^{3}-frac{9}{2} xmeets the conditions.Remark. Let's examine which rational-coefficient polynomials p satisfy p(sqrt{2}+sqrt{3})=sqrt{2}. It can be shown by some calculations that the numbers 1, sqrt{2}, sqrt{3}, sqrt{6} are linearly independent over the field of rational numbers, that is, if r_{1}, r_{2}, r_{3}, r_{4} are rational numbers such thatr_{1} cdot 1+r_{2} cdot sqrt{2}+r_{3} cdot sqrt{3}+r_{4} cdot sqrt{6}=0then necessarily r_{1}=r_{2}=r_{3}=r_{4}=0. If p(x) is of degree at most three, then p(x)=a x^{3}+b x^{2}+c x+d, where a, b, c, d are rational numbers. Precisely whenbegin{aligned}p(sqrt{2}+sqrt{3})-sqrt{2} & =a(11 sqrt{2}+9 sqrt{3})+b(5+2 sqrt{6})+c(sqrt{2}+sqrt{3})+d-sqrt{2}= & =(5 b+d) cdot 1+(11 a+c-1) sqrt{2}+(9 a+c) sqrt{3}+2 b sqrt{6}=0end{aligned}if 5 b+d=11 a+c-1=9 a+c=2 b=0. This system of equations has exactly one solution: a=frac{1}{2}, b=0, c=-frac{9}{2}, d=0. Therefore, we have found that among polynomials of degree at most three, exactly one satisfies the conditions of the problem: frac{1}{2} x^{3}-frac{9}{2} x. It can be easily verified that sqrt{2}+sqrt{3} is a root of the polynomial x^{4}-10 x^{2}+1. Let p now be any polynomial with rational coefficients. Divide p by x^{4}-10 x^{2}+1 with remainder:p(x)=left(x^{4}-10 x^{2}+1right) s(x)+r(x)where r and s are polynomials with rational coefficients, and r is of degree at most three. Due to the choice of x^{4}-10 x^{2}+1, we have p(sqrt{2}+sqrt{3})=r(sqrt{2}+sqrt{3}). Therefore, p satisfies the condition if and only if r does. Since r is of degree at most three, this is equivalent to r(x)=frac{1}{2} x^{3}-frac{9}{2} x. Summarizing the above, p satisfies the conditions if and only ifp(x)=left(x^{4}-10 x^{2}+1right) s(x)+frac{1}{2} x^{3}-frac{9}{2} xwhere s is any polynomial with rational coefficients."},{"problem":"For example, if 0<alpha<frac{pi}{2}, 0<beta<frac{pi}{2}, find the extremum of frac{1}{cos ^{2} alpha}+frac{1}{sin ^{2} alpha sin ^{2} beta cos ^{2} beta}, and the corresponding values of alpha and beta.","solution":"begin{array}{l}geqslant 2 sqrt{sin ^{2} alpha} cos ^{2} alpha sin ^{2} beta cos ^{2} beta =frac{8}{sin 2 alpha sin 2 beta} geqslant 8 text {, it is easy to list the above formula to get the minimum value } end{array}The condition for 8 is sin 2 alpha=sin 2 beta=1, at this time alpha=beta=frac{pi}{4}.

Since n is a positive integer (n in mathbb{N}_+), the function f(n) will have its minimum value at the integers closest to sqrt{33}. The two integers closest to sqrt{33} are 5 and 6. We now evaluate f(n) at both of these points:When n=5:frac {a_{5}}{5} = frac {5^2 - 5 + 33}{5} = frac {53}{5}When n=6:frac {a_{6}}{6} = frac {6^2 - 6 + 33}{6} = frac {63}{6} = frac {21}{2}Hence, the minimum value of frac {a_{n}}{n} is achieved when n=6, and its value is:boxed{frac {21}{2}}"},{"problem":"(1) Let a and b be two distinct positive numbers.

Total Number of Line Segments:   Given 997 points, the total number of line segments formed by joining every pair of points is given by the combination formula:   [   binom{997}{2} = frac{997 times 996}{2} = 497503   ]   Each of these line segments has a midpoint that is colored red.2. Distinct Midpoints:   We need to show that there are at least 1991 distinct midpoints. Consider the points A_i and A_j such that the segment A_iA_j has the greatest length among all segments connecting any two points. 3. Constructing Segments:   Construct segments A_iA_1, A_iA_2, ldots, A_iA_{997} and A_jA_1, A_jA_2, ldots, A_jA_{997}. These segments have distinct midpoints because if any segment A_iA_x has the same midpoint as some A_jA_y, then the quadrilateral A_iA_jA_xA_y would be a parallelogram with diagonals A_iA_x and A_jA_y. This would imply that A_iA_x > A_iA_j or A_jA_y > A_iA_j, which contradicts the assumption that A_iA_j is the longest segment.4. Counting Distinct Midpoints:   Since there are 995 points other than A_i and A_j, we have 995 segments from A_i to the other points and 995 segments from A_j to the other points. Each of these segments has a distinct midpoint. Additionally, the segment A_iA_j itself has a midpoint. Therefore, the total number of distinct midpoints is:   [   995 times 2 + 1 = 1991   ]5. Special Case:   A special case with exactly 1991 red points can be constructed when all points lie on a straight line and are equally spaced.

Find all pairs of real numbers k, l such that the inequalityk a^{2}+l b^{2}>c^{2}holds for the side lengths a, b, c of any triangle.(Patrik Bak)","solution":"Solution. Suppose that the given inequality holds for some pair k, l for the side lengths a, b, c of any triangle. If we substitute a=1, c=1 and any positive b>1 into it, we get an inequality that must hold. If k<1, for sufficiently small positive b, this inequality would no longer hold, so we must have k geq 1. Similarly, we must have l geq 1.In an orthonormal coordinate system, let us choose points A[-1,0], B[1,0], C[x, y]; points A, B, C are vertices of a triangle for any real x and any real y neq 0, and up to similarity, any triangle can be placed in this way. By substituting the side lengths of triangle ABC (which can be easily calculated using the Pythagorean theorem) into the given inequality, it transforms into the formkleft((x-1)^{2}+y^{2}right)+lleft((x+1)^{2}+y^{2}right)>4or equivalently,(k+l) x^{2}+2(l-k) x+k+l-4>-(k+l) y^{2}.This must hold for every x and any y neq 0. For a fixed x, we can achieve any negative value of the expression V(y)=-(k+l) y^{2} on the right side of the above inequality by choosing the value of y, since (as we already know) k+l>0. Therefore, for every x, we must have(k+l) x^{2}+2(l-k) x+(k+l-4) geq 0,which, given the positive coefficient of x^{2} on the left side, holds if and only if the corresponding discriminant D=4(l-k)^{2}-4(k+l-4)(k+l) is not positive. The inequality D leq 0 can be easily rearranged to the equivalent condition k l geq k+l.We have thus found that if the given inequality holds for any triple of side lengths of a triangle, the numbers k and l satisfy, in addition to the inequalities k geq 1 and l geq 1, the conditionk l geq k+lFrom the consideration of the discriminant, it follows conversely that if the numbers k geq 1 and l geq 1 satisfy condition (3), inequality (2) holds for every real x. Since for such k, l the value of V(y) is negative for every y neq 0, the validity of (2) for any x implies inequality (1) for all admissible pairs x, y, which is equivalent to the given property. The given condition is therefore also sufficient.The conjunction of the inequalities k geq 1, l geq 1 and k l geq k+l is thus a necessary and sufficient condition. Since the third inequality implies k neq 1 (as well as l neq 1), we can write the set of pairs (k, l) that satisfy the condition as follows:{(k, l): k>1 wedge l geq k /(k-1)}."},{"problem":"Alexis took a total of 243000 steps during the 30 days in the month of April.

Assuming (angle B = 60^circ + frac{1}{3}angle C):   We need to prove that (AI = AE). Replacing (C) with (180^circ - A - B) in the angle condition and simplifying gives:   [   frac{1}{2}angle A + 2angle B = 180^circ   ]   Hence, by considering (triangle ADB), it follows that:   [   angle ADB = angle B   ]   Note that (triangle CDE) is isosceles, so:   [   angle EDC = 90^circ - frac{1}{2}angle C   ]   This means:   [   angle EDI = 90^circ + frac{1}{2}angle C - angle B   ]   However, this expression is equal to (frac{1}{2}angle B) by rearranging the condition (angle B = 60^circ + frac{1}{3}angle C). Therefore:   [   angle FDA = frac{1}{2}angle B = angle ABF   ]   which implies (ABDF) is cyclic. Then:   [   angle EFI = angle DFB = angle DAB = frac{1}{2}angle A = angle EAI   ]   so (AIEF) is cyclic.

Part 2: Optimal Price Reduction for a Daily Profit of 1800 YuanGiven that the business wants to make a daily profit of 1800 yuan, we set up the equation using the new profit per piece and the adjusted daily sales:[(40-x)(30+3x) = 1800]Expanding and simplifying the equation:[1200 + 120x - 30x - 3x^2 = 1800][-3x^2 + 90x - 600 = 0]Dividing the entire equation by -3 to simplify:[x^2 - 30x + 200 = 0]Solving this quadratic equation, we find two possible values for x:[x_1 = 10, quad x_2 = 20]Given the context, where the business is offering discounts, the larger reduction in price would likely be the intended strategy to increase sales and meet the profit goal. Thus, we choose x = 20 yuan as the optimal price reduction.Therefore, the price of each piece of clothing should be reduced by boxed{20 text{ yuan}} for the business to make an average daily profit of 1800 yuan."},{"problem":"19.

What is the maximum number of black cells that the grid can contain after this operation?","solution":"Answer: 5100.Solution. Let k rows be repainted first, then k columns. After the first stage of repainting, each column will contain k black and 101-k white cells. Since 101-k columns will remain untouched, the total number of black cells in these columns will be k(101-k). In each of the repainted columns, there will be 101-k black cells, so the total number of black cells in these columns will be (101-k)k. Therefore, the total number of black cells is f(k) = 2k(101-k). It is clear that the graph of the function f(x) = 2x(101-x) is a parabola with branches pointing downwards. This means that the maximum value of the function f(x) = 2x(101-x) is achieved at the point a = frac{101}{2}, and the function increases up to this point and then decreases. Therefore, for any integer k, f(k) leq f(50) for 0 leq k leq 50 and f(k) leq f(51) for 51 leq k leq 101. It remains to note that f(50) = f(51) = 5100.Remark. The analysis of the behavior of the function f(x) can be conducted using the derivative. From the fact that the maximum value of the function f(x) is achieved at the point a = frac{101}{2}, it does not follow that the function f(k) (for integer k) must achieve its maximum value at one of the nearest integer points to a. Although this is true for our function, in general, there is a counterexample. For a valid conclusion, a reference to monotonicity is needed.Comment.

This is because for each pass, there are 3 possible recipients, and there are 3 passes in total.Step 3: Identify Relevant CasesWe need to find the number of sequences where B receives the ball exactly once. We can categorize the sequences based on the number of people involved in passing:1. Passing to 3 people (BCD, BDC, CDB, CBD, DCB, DBC): None of these sequences meet our criteria because B receives the ball in the first pass and is excluded from the next two passes.2. Passing to 2 people (BCB, CBC, BDB, DBC, DCD, CDC): None of these sequences meet our criteria because B either receives the ball more than once or is involved in a sequence that doesn't allow for exactly one reception.3. Passing back to A or involving A in some way (BAB, CAC, DAD, BCA, BAC, BDA, BAD, CAB, CBA, DAB, DBA, CAD, CAB, DBC, DCA): Out of these, the sequences that involve B receiving the ball exactly once and not immediately passing it back are BCA, BAC, BDA, BAD, CAB, CBA, DAB, DBA, which totals 8 possibilities.

The result of this problem allows for the experimental determination of the number pi by throwing a needle many times onto a grid and counting the number of times the needle intersects the drawn lines (recall that the frequency of occurrence of a given event is approximately equal to its probability). For example, by throwing the needle 5000 times, a value of pi approx 3.159 was obtained (it is difficult to achieve greater accuracy with this method, as it requires an extremely large number of throws). With this, we conclude the series of problems dedicated to the calculation of probabilities. Let us emphasize that the problems presented here belong to the \\"prehistory\\" of probability theory: the solution of such problems is associated with the emergence of this mathematical discipline in the 17th century in the works of Pascal, Fermat, and Huygens. The further development of probability theory in the 18th and early 19th centuries is linked to the names of J. Bernoulli, Laplace, and Gauss; in their works, many probabilistic problems were analyzed, and for the first time, ways to apply the new discipline to questions of natural science and technology were outlined. However, the final formation of probability theory into a major, deep, and extremely important practical science with its own unique methods of research occurred only in the second half of the 19th century and the beginning of the 20th century, thanks to the works of the remarkable Russian scientists P. L. Chebyshev and his students A. A. Markov and A. M. Lyapunov. The development of probability theory has not ceased to this day; currently, as before, leading roles in the development of this science are played by scientists from our country—first and foremost, Moscow mathematicians S. N. Bernstein, A. N. Kolmogorov, and A. Ya. Khinchin. Important research in probability theory is also conducted in several national republics of the Soviet Union: the achievements in this field, obtained by V. I. Romanovsky and his students in Central Asia and B. V. Gnedenko and his students in Ukraine, are widely known.Additional LiteratureB. V. Gnedenko and A. Ya.

Problems on the Mutual Position of Points and LinesProblems 101-107 relate to that part of geometry which deals only with questions of the mutual position of points and lines on a plane, but does not take into account distances between points or angles between lines. This part of geometry developed into a major science in the 19th century, known as projective geometry. The issues addressed in problems 101-107 pertain to a relatively narrow area of projective geometry, namely the theory of configurations; this theory is of great importance in modern mathematics (it is closely related to the recently developed algebraic theory of projective planes, in the development of which Moscow mathematicians have played an active role).The reader may find that the general subheading does not fit problems 101-103. For more on this, see the book by O. A. Volberg.## LiteratureO. A. Volberg, Basic Ideas of Projective Geometry, Chapter IV, M. - L., Uchpedgiz, 1949.D. Hilbert and S.

The position of the needle after its fall on a plane is determined by the distance y from the center of the needle A B to the nearest of the parallel lines and the angle x between the direction of the needle and the direction of these lines (Fig. 89).

The set of all outcomes here can be represented by the set of points filling the rectangle O M N P with sides O M=a and O P=pi (Fig. 90); in this case, the probability of a point (x, y) falling inside any part of this rectangle will be equal to the ratio of the area of this part to the area of the entire rectangle OMNP. Therefore, we only need to determine the area of the part of OMNP corresponding to favorable outcomes of the experiment.From Fig. 89, it is clear that for the needle A B to intersect one of the parallel lines, it is necessary and sufficient that the inequality y leqslant a sin x holds. The curve y=a sin x is a sine wave (see Fig. 90); the inequality y leqslant a sin x indicates that the favorable outcomes of the experiment will correspond to points located below this sine wave. According to problem 147b), the area under the sine wave is 2a. Since the area of the entire rectangle O M N P is a pi, the desired probability isfrac{2 a}{a pi}=frac{2}{pi} approx 0.637## SECTION II## PROBLEMS FROM VARIOUS AREAS OF MATHEMATICS"},{"problem":"A2.

This leads to two cases:- Case 1: h'(x) > 0, which simplifies to x-lambda > 0 or lambda  0 in the domain of h(x), this implies lambda leq 0 for h(x) to be monotonically increasing.  - Case 2: When lambda > 0, h'(x) changes sign, indicating h(x) is not monotonic over its entire domain.Thus, the range of lambda for h(x) to be monotonic is boxed{(-infty, 0]}.

In how many ways this set of points can be divided into two non-empty subsets with non-intersecting convex envelops?","solution":"To solve the problem of determining the number of ways to divide ( n ) points on a plane (with no three points collinear) into two non-empty subsets with non-intersecting convex hulls, we can proceed as follows:1. Understanding the Problem:   - We need to divide ( n ) points into two non-empty subsets such that their convex hulls do not intersect.   - This is equivalent to finding a line that separates the points into two groups.2. Defining the Function:   - Let ( f(n) ) be the number of ways to divide ( n ) points into two subsets with non-intersecting convex hulls.3. Base Case:   - For ( n = 2 ), there is only one way to divide the points into two subsets, each containing one point. Thus, ( f(2) = 1 ).4. Inductive Step:   - Consider adding a new point ( A_{n+1} ) to the set of ( n ) points ( A_1, A_2, ldots, A_n ).   - We need to count the number of ways to divide the ( n+1 ) points into two subsets with non-intersecting convex hulls.5. Case Analysis:   - Case 1: ( A_{n+1} ) and ( A_n ) are in the same subset.     - The number of ways to divide the remaining ( n ) points is ( f(n) ).   - Case 2: ( A_{n+1} ) and ( A_n ) are in different subsets.     - We can choose any of the ( n ) points to be in the same subset as ( A_{n+1} ), and the remaining points will be in the other subset.     - This gives us ( n ) ways to divide the points.6. Recurrence Relation:   - Combining the two cases, we get:     [     f(n+1) = f(n) + n     ]7. Solving the Recurrence:   - We start with ( f(2) = 1 ).   - Using the recurrence relation, we can compute ( f(n) ) for larger ( n ):     [     begin{align*}     f(3) &= f(2) + 2 = 1 + 2 = 3,      f(4) &= f(3) + 3 = 3 + 3 = 6,      f(5) &= f(4) + 4 = 6 + 4 = 10,      &vdots      f(n) &= 1 + 2 + 3 + cdots + (n-1).     end{align*}     ]8. Summation Formula:   - The sum of the first ( n-1 ) positive integers is given by:     [     1 + 2 + 3 + cdots + (n-1) = frac{(n-1)n}{2}     ]   - Therefore, we have:     [     f(n) = binom{n}{2}     ]Conclusion:The number of ways to divide ( n ) points into two non-empty subsets with non-intersecting convex hulls is given by ( boxed{binom{n}{2}} )."},{"problem":"Find the coordinates of the focus of the parabola x=ay^2 (a > 0).","solution":"The parabola x=ay^2 (a > 0) can be rewritten as y^2=frac{1}{a}x, which opens to the right with p=frac{1}{2a}.

For example, 51 is a 7-10 double because its base-7 representation is 102.  What is the largest 7-10 double?","solution":"1. Understanding the Problem:   We need to find the largest positive integer ( N ) such that the digits of its base-7 representation form a base-10 number that is twice ( N ). 2. Base-7 Representation:   Let ( N ) be represented in base-7 as ( overline{abc} ), where ( a, b, c ) are the digits in base-7. This means:   [   N = 49a + 7b + c   ]   The base-10 number formed by the digits ( a, b, c ) is:   [   100a + 10b + c   ]3. Setting Up the Equation:   According to the problem, this base-10 number is twice ( N ):   [   100a + 10b + c = 2(49a + 7b + c)   ]4. Simplifying the Equation:   Simplify the equation:   [   100a + 10b + c = 98a + 14b + 2c   ]   Rearrange terms to isolate variables:   [   100a + 10b + c - 98a - 14b - 2c = 0   ]   [   2a - 4b - c = 0   ]   [   2a = 4b + c   ]   [   a = 2b + frac{c}{2}   ]5. Finding Valid Digits:   Since ( a, b, c ) are digits in base-7, they must be integers between 0 and 6. Also, ( c ) must be even for ( frac{c}{2} ) to be an integer. Therefore, ( c ) can be 0, 2, 4, or 6.6. Testing Possible Values:   - If ( c = 0 ):     [     a = 2b     ]     Since ( a ) must be a digit in base-7, ( b ) can be 0, 1, 2, or 3.     - For ( b = 3 ):       [       a = 2 times 3 = 6       ]       Thus, ( N = 6 times 49 + 3 times 7 + 0 = 294 + 21 + 0 = 315 ).   - If ( c = 2 ):     [     a = 2b + 1     ]     - For ( b = 2 ):       [       a = 2 times 2 + 1 = 5       ]       Thus, ( N = 5 times 49 + 2 times 7 + 2 = 245 + 14 + 2 = 261 ).   - If ( c = 4 ):     [     a = 2b + 2     ]     - For ( b = 2 ):       [       a = 2 times 2 + 2 = 6       ]       Thus, ( N = 6 times 49 + 2 times 7 + 4 = 294 + 14 + 4 = 312 ).   - If ( c = 6 ):     [     a = 2b + 3     ]     - For ( b = 1 ):       [       a = 2 times 1 + 3 = 5       ]       Thus, ( N = 5 times 49 + 1 times 7 + 6 = 245 + 7 + 6 = 258 ).7.

Thus, the integral becomes:   [   b_n = int_{-frac{1}{2}}^{frac{1}{2}} e^{nu} , du   ]   Evaluating this integral, we get:   [   b_n = left[ frac{1}{n} e^{nu} right]_{-frac{1}{2}}^{frac{1}{2}} = frac{1}{n} left( e^{n/2} - e^{-n/2} right) = frac{2}{n} sinh frac{n}{2}   ]2.

For i=1,2,cdots ,n^2-1, the cell containing i shares a common side with the cell containing i+1. Each turn, Bred can choose one cell, and check what number is written. Bred wants to know where 1 is written by less than 3n turns. Determine whether n such that Bred can always achieve his goal is infinite.","solution":"1. Base Case Verification:   - For ( k = 1 ), ( n = 2^1 - 1 = 1 ). This is trivial since the grid is ( 1 times 1 ) and Bred can find the number 1 in one turn, which is less than ( 3n = 3 times 1 = 3 ).2. Inductive Hypothesis:   - Assume that for ( n = 2^k - 1 ), Bred can find the number 1 in less than ( 3n ) turns.3. Inductive Step:   - We need to show that for ( n = 2^{k+1} - 1 ), Bred can find the number 1 in less than ( 3n ) turns.   - Let ( n = 2m + 1 ) where ( m = 2^k - 1 ). The grid is now ((2m+1) times (2m+1)).4. Labeling the Grid:   - Label the grid ((i, j)) where ( 0 leq i, j leq 2m ).   - Let ( f(i, j) ) be the number written in the cell at row ( i ) and column ( j ).5. Initial Checks:   - Bred first checks the middle row ( f(m, j) ) for ( 0 leq j leq 2m ).   - Let ( k ) be the index such that ( f(m, k) = min_{0 leq j leq 2m} f(m, j) ).   - Check whether ( f(m-1, k) < f(m, k) ).6. Case Analysis:   - If ( f(m-1, k) < f(m, k) ), then the number 1 must lie between rows ( 0 ) to ( m-1 ).   - If ( f(m-1, k) geq f(m, k) ), then the number 1 must lie between rows ( m+1 ) to ( 2m ).7. Further Reduction:   - Assume ( f(m-1, k) < f(m, k) ). Now check ( f(0, m), f(1, m), ldots, f(m-1, m) ).   - If ( f(j, m) > f(m-1, k) ) for all ( 0 leq j leq m-1 ), then 1 is in the subgrid ((i, j)) where ( 0 leq i, j leq m-1 ).   - Otherwise, find the minimum ( f(j, m) ) and check ( f(j, m-1) ).8. Reduction to Smaller Grid:   - This process reduces the problem from a ((2m+1) times (2m+1)) grid to an ( m times m ) grid in ( 2m+1 + 1 + m + 1 = 3m + 3 ) moves.   - Since ( m = 2^k - 1 ), we have ( 3m + 3 = 3(2^k - 1) + 3 = 3 times 2^k ).9. Conclusion:   - By induction, Bred can always find the number 1 in less than ( 3n ) turns for ( n = 2^k - 1 ).The final answer is ( boxed{ n = 2^k - 1 } ) for ( k geq 1 )."},{"problem":"left[begin{array}{l}text { Pythagorean Theorem (direct and inverse) }end{array}right][Area of a triangle (using two sides and the angle between them).]Right triangles A B C and A B D have a common hypotenuse A B=5.

Thus, in this case, N has four different positive odd divisors. The same can be said for the even case. It is easy to find a small integer that has four different positive odd divisors. If we write down the integers in sequence and see how many divisors each has, we can immediately see that N=15 is such an example; its divisors are 1, 3, 5, and 15. The product of the divisors satisfies the equality 1 cdot 15=3 cdot 5.Since a+c > a-c; a+c=15, a-c=1, from which a=8, c=7. Furthermore, since d+b > d-b, d+b=5, d-b=3, and from this d=4, b=1.Indeed, N=8^{2}+1^{2}=7^{2}+4^{2}=65 is a solution.Now we only need to prove that 65 is the smallest integer that satisfies the requirement.For this, we construct the table of sums x^{2}+y^{2} for 1<x, y leq 8. From the table, we can read that the sums of squares are all different, except for the 65 we have already obtained.Remark.

Given the monotonicity on both sides of the y-axis, this inequality implies that the argument closer to zero (in absolute value) corresponds to the larger function value because the function increases as we move towards zero from both sides.4. Determining the Range of a: To find the range of a, we compare the absolute values of a+2 and a-3 because the function's behavior depends on the distance from zero due to its even nature and monotonicity. We set up the inequality |a+2| < |a-3|.5. Squaring Both Sides: To remove the absolute value and make the inequality easier to solve, we square both sides, resulting in (a+2)^2 < (a-3)^2. Expanding both sides gives a^2 + 4a + 4 < a^2 - 6a + 9.6. Solving the Inequality: Simplifying the inequality a^2 + 4a + 4 < a^2 - 6a + 9 by subtracting a^2 from both sides and moving all terms to one side, we get 10a < 5, which simplifies to a < frac{1}{2}.Therefore, the range of real number a that satisfies the given conditions is {a|a<frac{1}{2}}.

There are 36 possible edges in total. If not more than 3 edges are left undrawn, then we can choose 6 of the given 9 points no two of which are connected by an undrawn edge. These 6 points together with the edges between them form a two-colored complete graph, and thus by a well-known result there exists at least one monochromatic triangle. It follows that ( n leq 33 ). In order to show that ( n=33 ), we shall give an example of a graph with 32 edges that does not contain a monochromatic triangle. Let us start with a complete graph ( C_{5} ) with 5 vertices. Its edges can be colored in two colors so that there is no monochromatic triangle (Fig. 1). Furthermore, given a graph ( mathcal{H} ) with ( k ) vertices without monochromatic triangles, we can add to it a new vertex, join it to all vertices of ( mathcal{H} ) except ( A ), and color each edge ( B X ) in the same way as ( A X ). The obtained graph obviously contains no monochromatic triangles. Applying this construction four times to the graph ( C_{5} ) we get an example like that of Fig. 2. ![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_11_18_8e985d6b9c83aa3e9d0eg-568.jpg?height=338&width=396&top_left_y=1069&top_left_x=326)  Fig. 1 ![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_11_18_8e985d6b9c83aa3e9d0eg-568.jpg?height=326&width=396&top_left_y=1079&top_left_x=868)  Fig. 2Second solution. For simplicity, we call the colors red and blue. Let ( r(k, l) ) be the least positive integer ( r ) such that each complete ( r )-graph whose edges are colored in red and blue contains either a complete red ( k )-graph or a complete blue ( l )-graph. Also, let ( t(n, k) ) be the greatest possible number of edges in a graph with ( n ) vertices that does not contain a complete ( k )-graph. These numbers exist by the theorems of Ramsey and Turán. Let us assume that ( r(k, l) < n ). Every graph with ( n ) vertices and ( t(n, r(k, l)) + 1 ) edges contains a complete subgraph with ( r(k, l) ) vertices, and this subgraph contains either a red complete ( k )-graph or a blue complete ( l )-graph. We claim that ( t(n, r(k, l)) + 1 ) is the smallest number of edges with the above property. By the definition of ( r(k, l) ) there exists a coloring of the complete graph ( H ) with ( r(k, l) - 1 ) vertices in two colors such that no red complete ( k )-graph or blue complete ( l )-graph exists. Let ( c_{ij} ) be the color in which the edge ( (i, j) ) of ( H ) is colored, ( 1 leq i < j leq r(k, l) - 1 ). Consider a complete ( r(k, l) - 1 )-partite graph ( G ) with ( n ) vertices and exactly ( t(n, r(k, l)) ) edges and denote its partitions by ( P_i ), ( i = 1, ldots, r(k, l) - 1 ). If we color each edge of ( H ) between ( P_i ) and ( P_j ) (( j < i )) in the color ( c_{ij} ), we obviously obtain a graph with ( n ) vertices and ( t(n, r(k, l)) ) edges in two colors that contains neither a red complete ( k )-graph nor a blue complete ( l )-graph.

Let the roots be (b_1, b_2, ldots, b_{2n}).2. Product of Roots:   By Vieta's formulas, the product of the roots of the polynomial is given by:   [   b_1 b_2 cdots b_{2n} = 1   ]   This implies that none of the roots (b_i) can be zero.3. Sum of Roots:   The sum of the roots, again by Vieta's formulas, is:   [   b_1 + b_2 + cdots + b_{2n} = 10 - 2n   ]4. Sum of Reciprocals of Roots:   Since the product of the roots is 1, the sum of the reciprocals of the roots is:   [   frac{1}{b_1} + frac{1}{b_2} + cdots + frac{1}{b_{2n}} = 10 - 2n   ]5.

Case (n = 2):   For (n = 2), the polynomial becomes:   [   P(X) = X^4 - 6X^3 + a_2X^2 - 6X + 1   ]   We need to find the possible values of (a_2) such that all roots are positive.8.

The given polynomial ( P(t) = t^3 + at^2 + bt + c ) has 3 distinct real roots. This implies that the polynomial ( P(t) ) changes sign at each of its roots.2. Consider the equation ( (x^2 + x + 2013)^3 + a(x^2 + x + 2013)^2 + b(x^2 + x + 2013) + c = 0 ). Substituting ( y = x^2 + x + 2013 ), we get:   [   y^3 + ay^2 + by + c = 0   ]   This is equivalent to ( P(y) = 0 ).3. The problem states that the equation ( y^3 + ay^2 + by + c = 0 ) has no real roots. This implies that ( y = x^2 + x + 2013 ) cannot take any value that is a root of ( P(t) ).4. Since ( P(t) ) has 3 distinct real roots, denote them by ( r_1, r_2, r_3 ).

Since ( y = x^2 + x + 2013 ) must be strictly less than the smallest root or strictly greater than the largest root of ( P(t) ), and the minimum value of ( y ) is ( frac{8051}{4} ), it follows that ( frac{8051}{4} ) must be less than the smallest root of ( P(t) ).7. Therefore, ( P(2013) ) must be evaluated at ( t = 2013 ). Since ( P(t) ) has no real roots in the interval ( left(frac{8051}{4}, inftyright) ), it implies that ( P(2013) ) must be positive and greater than the value of ( P(t) ) at the smallest root plus a small positive fraction.8. To ensure that ( P(2013) > frac{1}{64} ), we note that the polynomial ( P(t) ) evaluated at ( t = 2013 ) must be greater than ( frac{1}{64} ) because ( y = x^2 + x + 2013 ) is strictly greater than ( frac{8051}{4} ).Therefore, we conclude that:[P(2013) > frac{1}{64}]The final answer is ( boxed{ P(2013) > frac{1}{64} } )"},{"problem":"12.076.

On the other hand, the equation0 cdot lambda_{3}=0is satisfied by any lambda_{3}, so we can accept a number different from 0, and then from (8) we also get a value for lambda_{1} and lambda_{2}.

Most of the submitted solutions formed new and new equations with more or less \\"intuition,\\" which is greatly facilitated by the small integer coefficients 1, 2, 3, and 6 in equations (1)-(3). However, there were also some solutions that reached the goal according to the following II. solution.2. Those who have already learned about systems of equations see that there is a \\"dependence\\" in the system (5)-(7), hence it has infinitely many solutions. For example, subtracting (5) from (6) yields 6 lambda_{2}-4 lambda_{3}=0, and (7) is not a new equation relative to this.However, in our case, this was fortunate. If, for example, 17 lambda_{3}=0 had resulted at (8), only lambda_{3}=0, lambda_{1}=0, and lambda_{2}=0 would have satisfied it, and the degeneration of (4) would have prevented us from reaching our goal. The fact that the right-hand side of each of (5)-(7) is 0 means that such a linear system is called homogeneous.II. Solution.

Thus, b_n=n+2.In summary, a_n=n and b_n=n+2.2. We have c_n=frac{b_n}{a_n}+frac{a_n}{b_n}=frac{n+2}{n}+frac{n}{n+2}=2+2(frac{1}{n}-frac{1}{n+2}). Therefore, the sum of the first n terms of sequence {c_n} is T_n=2n+2[ (1-frac{1}{3})+(frac{1}{2}-frac{1}{4})+(frac{1}{3}-frac{1}{5})+dots+(frac{1}{n-1}-frac{1}{n+1})+(frac{1}{n}-frac{1}{n+2})]. Simplifying, we get T_n=3+2n-2(frac{1}{n+1}+frac{1}{n+2}).So, T_n-2n=3-2(frac{1}{n+1}+frac{1}{n+2}). Let A_n=3-2(frac{1}{n+1}+frac{1}{n+2}). Since A_{n+1}-A_n=2(frac{1}{n+1}-frac{1}{n+3})>0, the sequence {A_n} is strictly increasing. Thus, the minimum value of A_n is A_1=frac{4}{3}. Furthermore, A_n<3.Hence, frac{4}{3}leq A_n < 3. Since T_n-2nin [a,b] for any positive integer n, we have aleq frac{4}{3} and bgeq 3. Therefore, the minimum value of b-a is 3-frac{4}{3}=boxed{frac{5}{3}}."},{"problem":"3.348. operatorname{tg} 9^{circ}+operatorname{tg} 15^{circ}-operatorname{tg} 27^{circ}-operatorname{ctg} 27^{circ}+operatorname{ctg} 9^{circ}+operatorname{ctg} 15^{circ}=8.","solution":"## Solution.begin{aligned}& operatorname{tg} 9^{circ}+operatorname{tg} 15^{circ}-operatorname{tg} 27^{circ}-operatorname{ctg} 27^{circ}+operatorname{ctg} 9^{circ}+operatorname{ctg} 15^{circ}= & =left(operatorname{tg} 9^{circ}+operatorname{ctg} 9^{circ}right)+left(operatorname{tg} 15^{circ}+operatorname{ctg} 15^{circ}right)-left(operatorname{tg} 27^{circ}+operatorname{ctg} 27^{circ}right)= & =left(frac{sin 9^{circ}}{cos 9^{circ}}+frac{cos 9^{circ}}{sin 9^{circ}}right)+left(frac{sin 15^{circ}}{cos 15^{circ}}+frac{cos 15^{circ}}{sin 15^{circ}}right)-left(frac{sin 27^{circ}}{cos 27^{circ}}+frac{cos 27^{circ}}{sin 27^{circ}}right)= & =frac{sin ^{2} 9^{circ}+cos ^{2} 9^{circ}}{sin 9^{circ} cos 9^{circ}}+frac{sin ^{2} 15^{circ}+cos ^{2} 15^{circ}}{sin 15^{circ} cos 15^{circ}}-frac{sin ^{2} 27^{circ}+cos ^{2} 27^{circ}}{sin 27^{circ} cos 27^{circ}}= & =frac{1}{sin 9^{circ} cos 9^{circ}}+frac{1}{sin 15^{circ} cos 15^{circ}}-frac{1}{sin 27^{circ} cos 27^{circ}}= & =frac{2}{2 sin 9^{circ} cos 9^{circ}}+frac{2}{2 sin 15^{circ} cos 15^{circ}}-frac{2}{2 sin 27^{circ} cos 27^{circ}}= & =frac{2}{sin 18^{circ}}+frac{2}{sin 30^{circ}}-frac{2}{sin 54^{circ}}=frac{2}{sin 18^{circ}}+frac{2}{frac{1}{2}}-frac{2}{sin 3left(18^{circ}right)}= & =frac{2}{sin 18^{circ}}+4-frac{2}{sin 3left(18^{circ}right)}=[sin 3 x=3 sin x-4 sin x]= & =frac{2}{sin 18^{circ}}+4-frac{2}{3 sin 18^{circ}-4 sin ^{3} 18^{circ}}=frac{1}{sin 18^{circ}}+4-frac{2}{3 sin 18^{circ}-4left(sin 18^{circ}right)^{3}}= & =left[sin 18^{circ}=frac{sqrt{5}-1}{4}left(mathrm{~cm} .

For any rational numbers x and y, both f(x + y) - f(x) - f(y) and f(xy) - f(x)f(y) are integers.   - We write x equiv y to indicate x - y in mathbb{Z}.2. Existence of a Non-Integer Value:   - From the first condition, there exists a in mathbb{Q} such that f(a) in mathbb{Q} setminus mathbb{Z}.   - Therefore, we can write f(a) = frac{a_1}{n} for some a_1, n in mathbb{Z}, n ge 2 and gcd(a_1, n) = 1.3.

Consider the numbers from the first hundred for which the sum of the digits is divisible by 5. Such numbers have a sum of digits of either 5, 10, or 15.

The maximum number of such boxes is 6 . One example is shown in the figure.Now we show that 6 is the maximum. Suppose that boxes B_{1}, ldots, B_{n} satisfy the condition. Let the closed intervals I_{k} and J_{k} be the projections of B_{k} onto the x - and y-axis, for 1 leq k leq n.If B_{i} and B_{j} intersect, with a common point (x, y), then x in I_{i} cap I_{j} and y in J_{i} cap J_{j}. So the intersections I_{i} cap I_{j} and J_{i} cap J_{j} are nonempty. Conversely, if x in I_{i} cap I_{j} and y in J_{i} cap J_{j} for some real numbers x, y, then (x, y) is a common point of B_{i} and B_{j}.

Hence left(I_{k}, I_{k+1}right) or ( left.J_{k}, J_{k+1}right) is a pair of disjoint intervals, 1 leq k leq n.

Consequently n leq 3+3=6, as stated. Thus we are left with the claim and its justification.Claim. Let Delta_{1}, Delta_{2}, ldots, Delta_{n} be intervals on a straight line such that every two nonadjacent intervals intersect. Then Delta_{k} and Delta_{k+1} are disjoint for at most three values of k=1, ldots, n.Proof. Denote Delta_{k}=left[a_{k}, b_{k}right], 1 leq k leq n. Let alpha=max left(a_{1}, ldots, a_{n}right) be the rightmost among the left endpoints of Delta_{1}, ldots, Delta_{n}, and let beta=min left(b_{1}, ldots, b_{n}right) be the leftmost among their right endpoints. Assume that alpha=a_{2} without loss of generality.If alpha leq beta then a_{i} leq alpha leq beta leq b_{i} for all i. Every Delta_{i} contains alpha, and thus no disjoint pair left(Delta_{i}, Delta_{i+1}right) exists.If beta<alpha then beta=b_{i} for some i such that a_{i}<b_{i}=beta<alpha=a_{2}<b_{2}, hence Delta_{2} and Delta_{i} are disjoint. Now Delta_{2} intersects all remaining intervals except possibly Delta_{1} and Delta_{3}, so Delta_{2} and Delta_{i} can be disjoint only if i=1 or i=3. Suppose by symmetry that i=3; then beta=b_{3}. Since each of the intervals Delta_{4}, ldots, Delta_{n} intersects Delta_{2}, we have a_{i} leq alpha leq b_{i} for i=4, ldots, n. Therefore alpha in Delta_{4} cap ldots cap Delta_{n}, in particular Delta_{4} cap ldots cap Delta_{n} neq emptyset. Similarly, Delta_{5}, ldots, Delta_{n}, Delta_{1} all intersect Delta_{3}, so that Delta_{5} cap ldots cap Delta_{n} cap Delta_{1} neq emptyset as beta in Delta_{5} cap ldots cap Delta_{n} cap Delta_{1}. This leaves left(Delta_{1}, Delta_{2}right),left(Delta_{2}, Delta_{3}right) and left(Delta_{3}, Delta_{4}right) as the only candidates for disjoint interval pairs, as desired.Comment. The problem is a two-dimensional version of the original proposal which is included below. The extreme shortage of easy and appropriate submissions forced the Problem Selection Committee to shortlist a simplified variant. The same one-dimensional Claim is used in both versions.Original proposal. We consider parallelepipeds in three-dimensional space, with edges parallel to the coordinate axes and of positive length. Such a parallelepiped will be called a box. Two boxes intersect if they have a common point in their interior or on their boundary.Find the largest n for which there exist n boxes B_{1}, ldots, B_{n} such that B_{i} and B_{j} intersect if and only if i not equiv j pm 1(bmod n).The maximum number of such boxes is 9 . Suppose that boxes B_{1}, ldots, B_{n} satisfy the condition. Let the closed intervals I_{k}, J_{k} and K_{k} be the projections of box B_{k} onto the x-, y and z-axis, respectively, for 1 leq k leq n. As before, B_{i} and B_{j} are disjoint if and only if their projections on at least one coordinate axis are disjoint.We call again two boxes or intervals adjacent if their indices differ by 1 modulo n, and nonadjacent otherwise.The adjacent boxes B_{i} and B_{i+1} do not intersect for each i=1, ldots, n. Hence at least one of the pairs left(I_{i}, I_{i+1}right),left(J_{i}, J_{i+1}right) and left(K_{i}, K_{i+1}right) is a pair of disjoint intervals. So there are at least n pairs of disjoint intervals among left(I_{i}, I_{i+1}right),left(J_{i}, J_{i+1}right),left(K_{i}, K_{i+1}right), 1 leq i leq n.Next, every two nonadjacent boxes intersect, hence their projections on the three axes intersect, too.

In the steps of the ox, it alternately changes its first and second coordinates. With its odd-numbered steps, it modifies its first coordinate, always in the opposite direction and a quarter of the magnitude of the previous one. Therefore, the modification of the first coordinate at k, that is, after the (2 k-1)-th step, will bex_{2 k-1}=1-frac{1}{4}+ldots+left(-frac{1}{4}right)^{k-1}=frac{1-left(-frac{1}{4}right)^{k}}{1-left(-frac{1}{4}right)}and its value remains the same after the 2 k-th step as well.The second coordinate changes similarly, and its value after the 2 k-th step isy_{2 k}=frac{1}{2}-frac{1}{8}+ldots+frac{1}{2}left(-frac{1}{4}right)^{k-1}=frac{1}{2} x_{2 k-1}and its value remains the same after the (2 k+1)-th step as well. Since the powers of 4 are different integers, the k-th one is greater than the k-th positive integer, that is, 4^{k}>k. Therefore, 4^{k} grows beyond any bound as k runs through the positive integers, and 4^{-k} approaches 0. Thus, the limit of x_{n} is 4 / 5, and the limit of y_{n} is half of that, 2 / 5.Let B_{n} denote the point left(x_{n} ; y_{n}right) and B the point left(frac{4}{5} ; frac{2}{5}right). Since the distance between B_{n} and B is less than the sum left|x-x_{n}right|+left|y-y_{n}right|, and this sum approaches 0, the ox approaches the point Bleft(frac{4}{5} ; frac{2}{5}right) more and more closely.II. solution.

Specifically, in the triangles B_{0} B_{1} B_{2} and B_{2} B_{3} B_{4}, the angles at B_{0} and B_{2} are equal, and their sides are oppositely directed. Therefore, the hypotenuses of these triangles lie on the same line, and B_{4} lies on the segment B_{0} B_{2}. Similarly, we find that B_{5} lies on the segment B_{1} B_{3}, or the segment B_{4} B_{5} can be obtained by a 16: 1 reduction of the segment B_{0} B_{1} from the point B. From this point onward, the entire path can be continued by applying this reduction to the broken line B_{0} B_{1} B_{2} B_{3} B_{4}, then to the result, and so on. In other words, if we apply a 16^{k}: 1 reduction to the broken line T_{0}=B_{0} B_{1} B_{2} B_{3} B_{4} from the center B, we get exactly the broken line T_{k}= B_{4 k} B_{4 k+1} B_{4 k+2} B_{4 k+3} B_{4 k+4}. Since among the points of the broken line T_{0}, B_{0} is the farthest from B, we get that the points of T_{k} are at most B_{0} B / 16^{k} away from B. Since this approaches 0 (which we can also verify as in the first solution, that 1 / 4^{k} approaches 0, although this can also be read directly from the latter statement), it follows that the ox gets closer and closer to the point B.The equation of the line B_{0} B_{2} is y=x / 2, and that of B_{1} B_{3} is y=2(1-x), so at their intersection, x=4 / 5, y=2 / 5, thus the coordinates of B are left(frac{4}{5} ; frac{2}{5}right)."},{"problem":"Given a quadratic equation in x: x^{2}+ax+4=0 has one root as 1, then the value of a is ______.","solution":"Given that one root of the quadratic equation x^{2}+ax+4=0 is 1, we substitute x=1 into the equation to find the value of a.

Version for klas 6(a) First, we determine for what starting values a_{1}>0 the inequalities frac{4}{3} leqslant a_{2} leqslant frac{3}{2} hold. Then, we will prove that for those starting values, the inequalities frac{4}{3} leqslant a_{n} leqslant frac{3}{2} are also valid for all n geqslant 2.First, we observe that a_{2}=frac{a_{1}+2}{a_{1}+1} and that the denominator, a_{1}+1, is positive (since a_{1}>0 ). The inequalityfrac{4}{3} leqslant a_{2}=frac{a_{1}+2}{a_{1}+1} leqslant frac{3}{2}is therefore equivalent to the inequalityfrac{4}{3}left(a_{1}+1right) leqslant a_{1}+2 leqslant frac{3}{2}left(a_{1}+1right)as we can multiply all parts in the inequality by the positive number a_{1}+1. Subtracting a_{1}+2 from all parts of the inequality, we see that this is equivalent tofrac{1}{3} a_{1}-frac{2}{3} leqslant 0 leqslant frac{1}{2} a_{1}-frac{1}{2} .We therefore need to have frac{1}{3} a_{1} leqslant frac{2}{3} (i.e. a_{1} leqslant 2 ), and frac{1}{2} leqslant frac{1}{2} a_{1} (i.e. 1 leqslant a_{1} ). The starting value a_{1} must therefore satisfy 1 leqslant a_{1} leqslant 2.Now suppose that 1 leqslant a_{1} leqslant 2, so that a_{2} satisfies frac{4}{3} leqslant a_{2} leqslant frac{3}{2}. Looking at a_{3}, we see that a_{3}=frac{a_{2}+2}{a_{2}+1}. That is the same expression as for a_{2}, only with a_{1} replaced by a_{2}. Since a_{2} also satisfies 1 leqslant a_{2} leqslant 2, the same argument now shows that frac{4}{3} leqslant a_{3} leqslant frac{3}{2}.We can repeat the same argument to show this for a_{4}, a_{5}, etcetera. Hence, we find that frac{4}{3} leqslant a_{n} leqslant frac{3}{2} holds for all n geqslant 2. The formal proof is done using induction: the induction basis n=2 has been shown above. For the induction step, see the solution of part (b) of the version for klas 5 & klas 4 and below. The result is that all inequalities hold if and only if 1 leqslant a_{1} leqslant 2.(b) Let's start by computing the first few numbers of the sequence in terms of a_{1}. We see thata_{2}=frac{a_{1}-3}{a_{1}+1} quad and quad a_{3}=frac{a_{2}-3}{a_{2}+1}=frac{frac{a_{1}-3}{a_{1}+1}-3}{frac{a_{1}-3}{a_{1}+1}+1}=frac{a_{1}-3-3left(a_{1}+1right)}{a_{1}-3+left(a_{1}+1right)}=frac{-2 a_{1}-6}{2 a_{1}-2}=frac{-a_{1}-3}{a_{1}-1}.Here, it is important that we do not divide by zero, that is, a_{1} neq-1 and a_{2} neq-1. The first inequality follows directly from the assumption. For the second inequality we consider when a_{2}=-1 holds. This is the case if and only if a_{1}-3=-left(a_{1}+1right), if and only if a_{1}=1. Since we assumed that a_{1} neq 1, we see that a_{2} neq-1. The next number in the sequence isa_{4}=frac{a_{3}-3}{a_{3}+1}=frac{frac{-a_{1}-3}{a_{1}-1}-3}{frac{-a_{1}-3}{a_{1}-1}+1}=frac{-a_{1}-3-3left(a_{1}-1right)}{-a_{1}-3+left(a_{1}-1right)}=frac{-4 a_{1}}{-4}=a_{1} .Again, we are not dividing by zero since a_{3}=-1 only holds when -a_{1}-3=-a_{1}+1, which is never the case.We see that a_{4}=a_{1}. Since a_{n+1} only depends on a_{n}, we see that a_{5}=a_{2}, a_{6}=a_{3}, a_{7}=a_{4}, et cetera. In other words: the sequence is periodic with period 3 , and we see thata_{2020}=a_{2017}=a_{2014}=cdots=a_{4}=a_{1}To conclude: indeed we have a_{2020}=a_{1} for all starting values a_{1} unequal to 1 and -1 ."},{"problem":"Given ((1-x)^{10}=a_{0}+a_{1}(1+x)+a_{2}(1+x)^{2}+ldots+a_{10}(1+x)^{10}), then (a_{9}=)  A: (-20)  B: (20)  C: (-10)  D: (10)","solution":"Since ((1-x)^{10}=(x-1)^{10}=[(1+x)-2]^{10}=a_{0}+a_{1}(1+x)+a_{2}(1+x)^{2}+ldots+a_{10}(1+x)^{10}),  (a_{9}) is the coefficient of the 10th term in the expansion, so (a_{9}=(-2)^{1}binom{10}{9}=-20).

How many different ways are there to select the 16 red cubes? Explain your reasoning.","solution":"Solution: Choose a 4 times 4 side of the 4 times 4 times 4 large cube as the base plane. Divide the large cube into four layers parallel to the base plane (each layer being 4 times 4 times 1 in size), and number these layers as 1, 2, 3, 4. Project each red unit cube onto the base plane and write the layer number of the red unit cube in the corresponding grid. This way, we obtain a 4 times 4 grid, where each cell contains a number from {1, 2, 3, 4}, and cells with the same number are neither in the same row nor in the same column. Such a 4 times 4 grid is called a 4th-order Latin square. Conversely, each 4th-order Latin square uniquely determines a coloring method that meets the problem's requirements, and different Latin squares determine different coloring methods. Therefore, the problem is reduced to determining: how many different 4th-order Latin squares are there.We agree to label the positions of the individual cells in the 4 times 4 grid as shown in Figure 1. For any permutation (a, b, c, d) of (1, 2, 3, 4), we will examine the number of Latin squares as shown in Figure 2. For this purpose, we first examine the number of Latin squares as shown in Figure 3.The (2,2) cell in Figure 3 can be filled with any number from {a, c, d}. We will examine these three cases separately.(i) Suppose the (2,2) cell in Figure 3 is filled with a.In this case, the (2,3) and (3,2) cells can only be filled with d; then the (2,4) and (4,2) cells can only be filled with c; then the (3,3) cell can be filled with a or b. Once the (3,3) cell is filled, the remaining three cells are uniquely determined. Therefore, there are exactly 2 Latin squares corresponding to this case.(ii) Suppose the (2,2) cell in Figure 3 is filled with c.In this case, the (2,4) and (4,2) cells can only be filled with a; then the (2,3) and (3,2) cells can only be filled with d; then the (3,4) and (4,3) cells can be filled with b. Once these cells are filled, the remaining cells are uniquely determined. Therefore, there is exactly 1 Latin square corresponding to this case.(iii) Suppose the (2,2) cell in Figure 3 is filled with d.Similar to case (ii), there is only one unique filling method for this case, i.e., there is exactly 1 Latin square.Based on the above discussion, there are exactly 4 Latin squares as shown in Figure 3. Each such Latin square can generate 3! different Latin squares as shown in Figure 2 by permuting the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th rows. Therefore, there are exactly 4 times 3! Latin squares as shown in Figure 2. Finally, since there are 4! permutations of (a, b, c, d), the total number of 4th-order Latin squares is (4!)^2.Thus, the total number of ways to select 16 red cubes is (4!)^2 = 576.Note: Consider a more general problem, in an n times n times n large cube, select n^2 unit cubes to be painted red, such that any 1 times 1 times n rectangular prism composed of n unit cubes contains exactly one red unit cube. How many different ways are there to select n^2 red unit cubes that meet the above requirements?Following the solution above, the problem can be reduced to finding the number of different n-order Latin squares L_n. The number of n-order Latin squares with the first row and first column being the standard permutation (1, 2, cdots, n) is denoted as l_n. Thus,L_n = (n!)((n-1)!) l_n.As n increases, l_n and L_n grow rapidly.

Similarly, we getCN = frac{a cdot b}{a+c}Since line CP is perpendicular to AB, the angles angle PCN and angle ABC are complementary, so angle PCN = beta. The angle at P in triangle PCN is thus 180^circ - beta - delta. By the Law of Sines in this triangle,begin{aligned}frac{CN}{CP} & = frac{sin(180^circ - beta - delta)}{sin delta} = frac{sin(beta + delta)}{sin delta} = & = frac{sin beta cos delta + cos beta sin delta}{sin delta} = sin beta cdot cot delta + cos betaend{aligned}Expressing the trigonometric functions in terms of the sides of triangles ABC and NMC, we getfrac{CN}{CP} = frac{b}{c} cdot left(frac{a cdot b}{a+c} / frac{a cdot b}{b+c}right) + frac{a}{c} = frac{b cdot (b+c)}{c cdot (a+c)} + frac{a}{c} = frac{a^2 + b^2 + c cdot (a+b)}{c cdot (a+c)}Using the Pythagorean Theorem and the (1) relationship, we getCP = CN cdot frac{c(a+c)}{c^2 + c(a+b)} = frac{a cdot b}{a+b+c}It is known that if the area of a triangle is T, the radius of its inscribed circle is r, and its sides are a, b, c, then r = frac{2T}{a+b+c}. Since in our case the legs of the right triangle ABC are a and b, we have 2T = a cdot b, so from (2) it follows that CP = r, which is the statement to be proven."},{"problem":"Let s_1 be the sum of the first n terms of the arithmetic sequence 8,12,cdots and let s_2 be the sum of the first n terms of the arithmetic sequence 17,19,cdots.

A template can be placed on paper in 8 different ways; in 4 ways with the front side facing up, and in 4 ways with the back side facing up. We transition between different placements by rotating the template by 90^{circ} around its center and by flipping the template over one of its 4 axes of symmetry (which corresponds to reflecting over that axis). Therefore, the same green square on the template can cover those squares on the paper that we reach with these operations.

This is sufficient because each set of squares with the same number can be covered by one green square on the template (using the operations mentioned above).

Completing the square gives us y=(x^{2}-x+frac{1}{4})-2-frac{1}{4}, which simplifies to y=left(x-frac{1}{2}right)^{2}-frac{9}{4}. This form reveals that the graph is a parabola opening upwards, with its vertex at left(frac{1}{2}, -frac{9}{4}right) and the axis of symmetry at x=frac{1}{2}.3. Graphical Interpretation:   - Given that the parabola opens upwards and has its vertex at left(frac{1}{2}, -frac{9}{4}right), we know that to the right of the axis of symmetry (x=frac{1}{2}), the value of y increases as x increases. This is crucial for understanding how the roots of the equations change as we adjust the constant term on the right side of the equations.4. Comparing the Constants:   - The constants on the right side of the equations are -0.1 for all three equations, but when we consider the effect of the scaling factors (1, 2, and 3) on the left side, we effectively have the constants -0.1, -frac{1}{20}, and -frac{1}{30} when comparing them to the base function y=x^{2}-x-2. Since -0.1 < -frac{1}{20} < -frac{1}{30}, and knowing that to the right of the axis of symmetry y increases as x increases, it follows that the larger roots of the equations (denoted as x_{1}, x_{2}, and x_{3}) will follow the order x_{1} < x_{2} < x_{3}.5. Conclusion:   - Based on the analysis, the correct statement among the given options is that the larger roots of the three equations follow the order x_{1} < x_{2} < x_{3}.

Find the maximum value of the number of festivities that can be organized.","solution":"1. Problem Setup and Graph Representation:   We start by representing the problem using a bipartite graph ( G = (C cup D, E) ), where:   - ( C ) is the set of colors.   - ( D ) is the set of dwarfs.   - ( E ) is the set of edges representing the hats, with each edge connecting a color to a dwarf.      Given:   [   #C = #D = 66, quad #E = 111   ]2. Perfect Matchings and Festivities:   Each festivity corresponds to a perfect matching in ( G ). Our goal is to estimate the maximum number of distinct perfect matchings in ( G ).3. Lemma Statement:   For any bipartite graph ( G = (C cup D, E) ) where ( #C = #D = n ) and ( #E = e ), ( G ) contains at most ( 2^{leftlfloor frac{e-n}{2} rightrfloor} ) distinct perfect matchings.4. Proof by Induction:   - Base Case (( n = 1 )): The conclusion is trivial since there can be at most one edge, leading to at most one perfect matching.      - Inductive Step:     Assume the lemma holds for ( n-1 ). Consider the case for ( n ). Assume each vertex has a positive degree. Pick a vertex ( v ) with the smallest degree ( s ). Let the neighbors of ( v ) be ( u_1, dots, u_s ) (where ( s ge 1 )).          For each possible perfect matching ( M ), let the neighbor of ( v ) in ( M ) be ( u_i ). Remove ( v ) and ( u_i ) (and their adjacent edges) from ( G ), leaving a graph ( G' ) with ( 2(n-1) ) vertices and at most ( e - (2s - 1) ) edges.

Since there are ( s ) choices for ( i ), the total number of perfect matchings in ( G ) does not exceed:     [     s cdot 2^{-s+1} cdot 2^{leftlfloor frac{e-n}{2} rightrfloor} le 2^{leftlfloor frac{e-n}{2} rightrfloor}     ]5.

These roots are given by:   [   z_k = e^{2pi i k / n} quad text{for} quad k = 0, 1, 2, ldots, n-1   ]   These points are evenly spaced on the unit circle in the complex plane.2. Choosing a point to shoot at:   When we pick a point in the complex plane, each soldier will shoot a straight line towards that point. If a soldier's shot hits another soldier, the hit soldier dies and will not shoot in the next round.3. Strategy to eliminate soldiers:   To minimize the number of rounds, we need to choose points such that the maximum number of soldiers are hit in each round. One effective strategy is to choose points that lie on the lines connecting pairs of soldiers.4. Example for n = 3:   For n = 3, the soldiers are located at the points:   [   1, quad e^{2pi i / 3}, quad e^{4pi i / 3}   ]   These points correspond to:   [   1, quad -frac{1}{2} + ifrac{sqrt{3}}{2}, quad -frac{1}{2} - ifrac{sqrt{3}}{2}   ]   If we pick the point -1/2 + i, the soldier at -1/2 + isqrt{3}/2 will be hit. This leaves the soldiers at 1 and -1/2 - isqrt{3}/2.5. Generalizing the strategy:   For a general n, we can use a similar approach. By choosing points that lie on the lines connecting pairs of soldiers, we can ensure that each round eliminates a significant number of soldiers. 6. Minimum number of rounds:   To eliminate all n soldiers, we need to ensure that each round maximizes the number of soldiers hit. Since each round can potentially eliminate up to half of the remaining soldiers, the minimum number of rounds required is approximately log_2(n).

The equation of the parabola tells us that it opens to the right. Step 1: Understanding the Focus and Centroid RelationshipThe problem states that overrightarrow{FA} + overrightarrow{FB} + overrightarrow{FC} = overrightarrow{0}. This implies that the vector sum of the positions of points A, B, and C relative to the focus F equals zero. In geometric terms, this means that the focus F is also the centroid of the triangle formed by points A, B, and C on the parabola. Step 2: Calculating the Sum of the x-coordinatesSince F is the centroid of triangle ABC, the average of the x-coordinates of A, B, and C must be equal to the x-coordinate of F.

Since F has coordinates (2,0), and each point on the parabola is of the form (x,y), the distance from F to any point on the parabola can be thought of as the difference in their x-coordinates (because the parabola opens to the right and F is on the axis of symmetry).Thus, for a point (x,y) on the parabola, the distance to F is |x - 2|. However, since all points A, B, and C are on the right side of F, their x-coordinates are greater than 2, making the absolute value unnecessary. Therefore, the distance from F to each point is simply x - 2.Adding up the distances, we get:[|{overrightarrow{FA}}| + |{overrightarrow{FB}}| + |{overrightarrow{FC}}| = (x_A - 2) + (x_B - 2) + (x_C - 2)]Simplifying, we find:[= x_A + x_B + x_C - 6]Substituting x_A + x_B + x_C = 6 from Step 2, we have:[= 6 - 6 = 0]However, considering the distances also include the distance from the focus to the parabola, which is 2 units for each point, we actually need to add 2 for each point to correct our calculation.

Determine the largest n such that we can always pick some of the 5 chosen numbers so that they can be made into two groups whose numbers have the same sum (a group may contain only one number).","solution":"To solve this problem, we need to determine the largest ( n ) such that any five numbers chosen from the set ({1, 2, ldots, n}) can always be partitioned into two groups with equal sums.1. Understanding the Pigeonhole Principle:   The Pigeonhole Principle states that if ( n ) items are put into ( m ) containers, with ( n > m ), then at least one container must contain more than one item. We will use this principle to show that for ( n leq 15 ), any five numbers chosen from ({1, 2, ldots, n}) can always be partitioned into two groups with equal sums.2. Sum of Subsets:   Consider the set ({1, 2, ldots, n}). The number of subsets of any set of size ( n ) is ( 2^n ). For any subset of size 5, there are ( 2^5 = 32 ) possible subsets (including the empty subset). However, we are interested in non-empty subsets, so there are ( 2^5 - 1 = 31 ) non-empty subsets.3. Possible Sums:   The maximum sum of any subset of 5 numbers from ({1, 2, ldots, n}) is achieved by the subset ({n-4, n-3, n-2, n-1, n}). For ( n = 15 ), this subset is ({11, 12, 13, 14, 15}), and the sum is ( 11 + 12 + 13 + 14 + 15 = 65 ). Therefore, the possible sums of subsets of 5 numbers from ({1, 2, ldots, 15}) range from 1 to 65.4. Applying the Pigeonhole Principle:   Since there are 31 non-empty subsets and the possible sums range from 1 to 65, by the Pigeonhole Principle, there must be at least two subsets with the same sum if we choose 5 numbers from ({1, 2, ldots, 15}). This means that for ( n leq 15 ), we can always find two subsets with the same sum.5. Counterexample for ( n geq 16 ):   Consider the set ({1, 2, 4, 8, 16}). The sums of all non-empty subsets are distinct: ( 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31 ). Therefore, for ( n geq 16 ), it is possible to choose 5 numbers such that no two subsets have the same sum.Conclusion:Thus, the largest ( n ) such that any five numbers chosen from ({1, 2, ldots, n}) can always be partitioned into two groups with equal sums is ( n = 15 ).The final answer is ( boxed{ n = 15 } )."},{"problem":"12.

This allows us to establish an equation for the common ratio, which can be solved to find the answer.This problem tests the properties of geometric sequences. The key to solving the problem is to identify that the two negative numbers -72 and -32 are terms of the sequence. By applying the properties of geometric sequences, we can derive an equation for the common ratio. This problem examines the ability to judge, reason, and transform ideas."}]`),D={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:S},data(){return{searchQuery:"",visibleCount:6,poemsData:F,isLoading:!1}},computed:{filteredPoems(){return this.searchQuery.trim()?this.poemsData.filter(i=>{const e=this.searchQuery.toLowerCase();return i.problem.toLowerCase().includes(e)||i.solution.toLowerCase().includes(e)}).slice(0,this.visibleCount):this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(i=>setTimeout(i,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},P={class:"search-container"},I={class:"card-container"},z=["disabled"],E={key:0},L={key:1};function M(i,e,h,d,o,r){const m=p("PoemCard");return a(),n("section",null,[e[3]||(e[3]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🤔 AI effective tips collection 🧠")])],-1)),t("div",P,[e[2]||(e[2]=t("span",{class:"search-icon"},null,-1)),g(t("input",{type:"text",class:"search-input","onUpdate:modelValue":e[0]||(e[0]=s=>o.searchQuery=s),placeholder:"Search..."},null,512),[[b,o.searchQuery]])]),t("div",I,[(a(!0),n(x,null,y(r.filteredPoems,(s,u)=>(a(),w(m,{key:u,poem:s},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),r.hasMorePoems?(a(),n("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:o.isLoading,onClick:e[1]||(e[1]=(...s)=>r.loadMore&&r.loadMore(...s))},[o.isLoading?(a(),n("span",L,"Loading...")):(a(),n("span",E,"See more"))],8,z)):_("",!0)])}const N=f(D,[["render",M],["__scopeId","data-v-b46ef447"]]),W=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"quotes/64.md","filePath":"quotes/64.md"}'),R={name:"quotes/64.md"},O=Object.assign(R,{setup(i){return(e,h)=>(a(),n("div",null,[v(N)]))}});export{W as __pageData,O as default};
