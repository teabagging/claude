On microscopy, you can discover bacteria and the white blood cells. If these are raised, you will be able to know that you have UTI. To treat the UTI, you will need to start on antibiotics.

During the years she had to do other operations always because sometimes the pacemakers and sometimes the catheters were always defective, NOT because she was sick or because she had some other problems. The catheter that she has inside was defective and now the kind of sheath that covers the tip of the catheter is broken inside the heart to 180 degrees (half of it). If it will create infection my mother will die in 3 hours and she will neither have the time to arrive to the hospital in Pisa (Italy). At the moment the doctor of Pisa refuses to do the operation because it is very risky. I don t know what to do. I can t accept that i will lose my mother because someone did a mistake , i maybe could if she was sick but she is not and she is just 50. it s a continuos pain in my heart and in my brain that never stop from 11 years.

Her renal isotope scan confirm the presence of hydronephrosis.Renal isotope scan help in assessing kidney function.MCU (Micturating Cysto-Urethrogram) help in establishing site of obstruction.Considering her age and female sex there is high possibility of vesicoureteric  reflux, it means there is back blow of urine from urinary bladder to ureter.Depending upon its grade appropriate treatment can be planned.There may be need for surgical correction in some cases depending upon grade.You should consult urosurgeon or pediatric surgeon for appropriate treatment.Hope this helps you, if so do vote as helpful."},{"Patient":"My uncle has been in the ICU for nearly 24 hours with chest pressure, erratic heart rate 135 to 90bpm,  atrial fibrillation, and his enzyme levels keep increasing and are now over 18 from 2.5 last evening.

The tech who called with my results last week could only say there were signs of calcification, possible kidney stones. Now finally, my question: would kidney stones be causing so many pooping problems and so much CONSTANT pain in my middle left to lower left abdomen, especially right after eating?","Doctor":"Kidney stones generally will not cause any pain in relation to food.

Can the injections effect my kidneys?","Doctor":"Hi.Thank you for writing to HCM.I have gone through your query and understand the anguish you must be facing. I think that you have had a reaction to the medication that you have taken.The medication might contain a NSAID and these are known to affect kidney function. If your kidneys were already damaged or not functioning at optimum level, then there is a chance of damage. I recommend that you see a Doctor and get a kidney function test.Drink a lot of water and if you have not produced urine in the last 12 hours, then rush to the ER as you may have kidney damage which is causing the pain. This is an emergency and you will need to be treated quickly.Hope this helps you.

When I came back in later that it changed so had me to redo new blood test. now 47. so he sent me back to be new test now at 43, now Friday he wants me to do new blood test. What should my level be and should I be worried?","Doctor":"Hi.Thank you for writing to HCM.I think it would be better if you give me the name of the test that was used. There are a few tests like the Urea levels in the blood which can range from 40 to 60. The kidney function based on creatinine can also range for 40 % function to 60% function. I believe that your Doctor is going to test for creatinine levels again to determine if the kidney is functioning well or not.Ideally a kidney function of 100% is needed. You will need dialysis at approximately 50% depending on the symptoms. Please confirm this with your Doctor or send me more details of your reports.Hope this helps you. Dr Vignan"},{"Patient":"My son is 32 yrs old and has just found out through blood work that his kidneys are functioning at 45 per cent and he has elevated protein in his blood work. He also says that every time he drinks water he has to go to the bathroom right away. He was checked for diabetes and does not have it. What does this mean","Doctor":"Thank you for choosing HealthCare MagicI have looked through the question and can understand the stress that you must be facing. Based on the question, nephritic or nephrotic kidney disease.There is a chance that there is a chronic renal failure in which the body is not able to excrete the waste substances in the body. This will be most evident with a high level of creatinine in the blood.There are a few modalities of treatment for this. You can start on conservative treatment initially and if your son is stable, then he can control his diet and lifestyle habits so that he can avoid dialysis. Dialysis eventually will start as the kidney function worsens. After some time, itching of the skin and rashes will become prevalent. At this point, I would recommend him to get treated with dialysis. You can also start dialysis early to help him not develop any symptoms. Do talk to a kidney specialist and you can confirm the Doctor's opinions with me. All the best for your son.

If your both pain symptoms have come after the fall, then they might be related with the injury because of the fall.If the pain in base of spine is very excruciating then it will be advisable to get a x ray of the part to see for any fracture.The pain in the kidney region might be also because of the blunt trauma.Kidney infection normally have symptoms like fever, burning urination, some whitish particles in urine or may be blood also.

So if kidney is not functioning properly, then the levels of creatinine and urea goes above normal levels.That is why we check serum creatinine and urea to indirectly see the functioning of kidney.

He had just had stones blasted from the other kidney two weeks before the infection which put him in intensive care.","Doctor":"Hi,Thanks for writing in.Infection is always caused by a pathogenic organism like a bacteria. Stones in kidney causes stasis of urine and this leads to urinary obstruction. The urinary blockage acts as a favorable medium for the bacteria to multiply. Some times infection might also ascend from the urinary bladder and enter the kidneys. In severe cases the bacteria release air in the collecting system of the kidneys and cause a condition called emphysematous pyelonephritis.Doing a blood culture and sensitivity is important to know any blood borne septicemia. Similarly a urine culture and sensitivity will also help. A broad range antibiotic should be given through intravenous route. This ensures better drug delivery and at higher concentration to kill the disease causing bacteria. Most people recover in a week after starting treatment. Cancer is less likely however detailed imaging is suggested. Please do not worry."},{"Patient":"what are the main reasons for Kidney failure among Indians?is Kidney failure always related to Anemia? My hemoglobin count is  6.8my doctor said, my kidneys are functioning at 17%. but I do not have any symptoms. can this be true? what can be the treatment?","Doctor":"Hi,Thanks for writing in.Diabetes and hypertension are the main reasons of kidney disease in Indians. It is well known that diabetes and hypertension targets the kidney function in the glumerulus and causes nephropathy. It begins by permitting proteins to be excreted in urine and this progressively increases with time.After few years the renal function goes down and the protein excretion increases. This starts a cascade of events terminating in increasing serum creatinine level and the kidney starts to shrink. Once there is chronic kidney disease grade III then reversibility is difficult. Anemia also is responsible for progressive kidney function deterioration. The kidney releases erythropoietin which is a molecule to increase the hemoglobin and if there is kidney disease then this is not secreted in adequate amount and the cycle repeats. Please discuss your condition with your doctor. Please do not worry."},{"Patient":"Been smoking marijuana for past few months.

However an addiction to marijuana might cause you to reduce drinking water and this might predispose to a condition leading to formation of kidney stones. What happens is marijuana is a recreation drug and the person gets busy and will not find time to drink adequate amounts of water and juices.Therefore indirectly smoking marijuana might drift your mind away from normal pattern of eating and drinking water and this leads to build up of kidney stones.

It makes it had to sit or sleep due to the pain. I am constantly changing position to ease the constant pain in my leg. If i run my hand down the outside of the leg I can feel like lumps. Mostly close to my knee that I had surgery on 28 years ago. I would like to know what I can do to stop the non stop pain.","Doctor":"Hi,Thanks for writing in.It is important to know if you still have kidney stones and whether the pain is radiating from to the lower back. You might like to get an ultrasound scan of abdomen done to confirm if the pain is from kidney stones.Lower back pain radiating to the leg is in most cases unrelated to the kidney stones though both pains might get difficult to differentiate. To evaluate the lower back it is important to get a clinical examination done and if required then do a MRI scan of lumbar spine. This will highlight any disc abnormalities and pinching of nerve roots in the lower back region. If present then physiotherapy usually treats this problem if it is of mild nature. Persistent pain might require short duration nerve pain relief medicine and avoidance of heavy physical activities.

The function of various organs are inter linked and the heart has and effect on the performance of the kidneys and the kidneys have a role on the heart function. Since ejection fraction of heart is 20 percent therefore there is severe compromise in heart function. With this the blood reaching the kidney is also less and therefore the kidney might not be in a position to filter out the toxic products entirely.Knowing the serum creatinine and GFR might help to predict the expected progress of disease. He is on pacemaker and defribrillator and therefore any abnormal cardiac conditions are taken care of and corrected automatically. In this way it is possible to sustain for another 6 to 12 months with recommended care and support. Please do not worry."},{"Patient":"My CT scan showed I had hydronephrosis and hydroureter on my right kidney but no stones. My doctor said I might have passed a stone but I didn t feel it. Two days later I had a sonogram of my kidney and it showed no stones and that my kidney went back to normal also my urine test came out cleared too. Can it be caused by something else and can it come and go?","Doctor":"Hi,Thanks for writing in.It is important to know the symptoms you had which made you consult your doctor. There are occasions when a kidney infection might cause hydronephrosis and hydroureter and this causes symptoms of fever and pain due to infection. Usually urine culture reports are indicative of an infection in these patients.Stones might also cause hydroureter and hydronephrosis after they have passed out and this is also one of the arguements put forth bu your doctor. This is to be suspected if you had severe pain along the sides of your abdomen going to the groin on the right side.Lastly it might be a congenital variation showing the swollen appearance of the kidney and proximal ureter. In this condition the other tests are normal and the patient usually does not have severe symptoms. Patient might be asymptomatic or have mild symptoms. This does not require any specific treatment. Please drink adequate amount of water. Please do not worry."},{"Patient":"Hello. Roughly 3 years ago I was in an accident and had a battery of tests done at the hospital. The only thing that was said is that on my x-ray it showed an enlarged kidney, but that was told to me by the doctor in passing as I was laying on the gerny in the hallway. Ive had blood work (yearly) and urine tests since then for physicals and nothing out of the ordinary has ever been mentioned. Im at a point in my life where Im fully enjoying it and want to get it checked out so I had an ultrasound earlier this year. Can there be anything that could come of this if it was years ago it was mentioned an nothing has shown up on recent tests. On the ultrasound (done in January 2014) nothing was shown either. And I specifically asked about it being enlarged. At times I get sore in my back side by kidneys and start to worry. Maybe just being nervous and I don t want anything to happen to me for a long long time.","Doctor":"Hi,Thanks for writing in.A normal kidney size measures 80 to 120 mm in length with the difference in length between two kidneys being not more than 20 mm. Therefore of your kidney is within this range then it is not a serious concern.There are patients in who one particular kidney might be larger than usual because of hypertrophy. This is only an increase in size and does not mean the kidney is under any type of stress or is diseased; this is an acceptable normal variant condition.If your blood tests for kidney function are normal and no significant abnormality is noted then your kidney is not a concern.

What could this be?","Doctor":"Hi,Thanks for writing in.A 3 mm stone in the kidney is very small and unlikely to cause any obstruction to passage of urine. It will most likely pass by itself and rarely might cause mild pain along the sides and lower abdomen on its way out of the system.Flomax and ciprofloxacin are given to cause pain relief and treat any urinary infection. It is not possible for a 3 mm stone to get stuck for a long time and it usually passes out with the urine flow. Your nausea and dizziness cannot be explained due to this completely and I suggest you get a blood check done to know there is any condition.

I hurt my lower back 2 days ago but that had seemed to get better but now this is much higher and on just the 1 side. Should I go to emergency room? Hard to sit, lay or stand. Thank you, Mark","Doctor":"Hi,Thanks for writing in.The diarrhea is probably due to a stomach flu or bowel infection and unrelated to your fall two days back. Please drink adequate water and eat healthy foods to suppress the diarrhea.The back pain after the fall is from muscle spasm. After your fall the muscles in the back got injured. These release pain causing substances due to muscle injury a day after your fall. Therefore the pain seemed to get better on the first day and then was severe the following day. This will improve in 3 to 5 days and avoidance of heavy physical activity is suggested. Please apply pain relief ointment.

I had malnutrition prior to transplant but am eating well now and have good weight.","Doctor":"Hi,Thanks for writing in.The symptoms of experiencing bubbles in the back area is not completely understandable in the absence of a clinical examination. Your health has otherwise been unremarkable and you are on immunosuppressive medicines after the heart transplant.Any fluid collection in the abdomen is important to be analyzed and probably an ultrasound scan or a CT scan might help in looking out for any such condition. Since you do not have pain and fever therefore it is less likely that you have any infection in the abdomen. You are also maintaining your nutrition and fluids and this is to be continued. Please do not worry."},{"Patient":"My husband passed a kidney stone two days ago. He has been fatigued and light headed. Today began complaining of pain in his right shoulder area.

Any person over 70 years will have blood pressure up to 150/ 90 mm Hg. Therefore if his blood pressure is 168/ 100 mm Hg then he surely has hypertension and this requires attention. The light headedness and fatigue might be due to hypertension and also probably if your husband is recovering after passing the kidney stone.Please provide him adequate amounts of fluids and juices so that any other smaller stone stuck any where along his urinary tract might be passed out. Medicines need to be given to control his blood pressure. If his blood pressure is consistently high then please discuss with his doctor and try and know if he is taking any medicines which might increase the blood pressure.

I read carefully your query and I understand your concerns. The blood report you are showing me indicates a slightly elevated Eosinophil count. Normal value ranges may vary slightly among different laboratories, and in the laboratory I work, the normal range is considered less than 350 cells per microliter (cells/mcL). Eosinophils are a type of disease-fighting white blood cell. They become active when you have certain allergic diseases or parasitic infections, but in your case the history with allergies. The Treatment you are taking, is an antihistamine, which Regarding SGOT and GPT levels, they are considered very slightly increased, but nothing to worry about.Regarding the treatment of this condition, I would suggest you to have an allergy test, in order to define the agent which causes you allergy. The most appropriate treatment for allergies is avoiding the causal allergen.Hope I helped with my answer.

Even ones own urine is not recommended for consumption. Coming to the point of contention, it is unlikely that you will get kidney stones from drinking your wifes urine.There are many other reasons which might be harmful if you continue to drink your wifes urine. The bacteria might proliferate in your system and cause chemical breakdown and increase the incidence of urinary tract infection. Therefore there might exist a relationship between urine consumption and increased risk of kidney stones.

Meanwhile, I m still in pain,, still vomiting and still nauseous. Any ideas would be appreciated.","Doctor":"Hi,Thanks for writing in.Stones are deposition of calcium and other minerals in the kidneys and urinary tract. A stone might cause obstruction to the passage of urine and lead to obstruction. This obstruction of urine might lead to sedimentation and stagnation of urine in the system.When there is pooling of urine and obstruction then there is bacterial proliferation in the urine generated. This might be due to bacteria ascending the urinary tract through the urinary bladder and then involve the ureter and kidneys. Once it reaches the kidneys then it causes infection and bacterial growth. This leads to release of toxins and symptoms of pyelonephritis including nausea, fever and pain abdomen. In severe cases there is gas formation by the bacteria leading to a serious infection called emohysematous pyelonephritis in kidneys.

It is possible that drinking tonic water might have substances which have chemical composition similar to cocaine and this might cause a false positive test. Please get treated for your kidney infection on time and the infection is to be controlled completely with a short course of antibiotics.Taking any pain relief for kidney infection might interact with the test for cocaine and give positive result.

There is a minimum weight for the person undergoing dialysis which is called as ‘dry weight’. It is that weight which is free of any extra fluid or very minimal fluid in body after which weight reduction is not advised or done.Dialysis procedure removes the excess water along with waste products from body. So, if the patient has not gained much weight in period between dialysis but loses more weight during dialysis then he loses out the volume of fluid in body which causes hypotension which is low BP.I will advise you to talk with your nephrologist to consider weight reduction during next dialysis and see whether BP picks up and also to find out the appropriate dry weight for the patient and to maintain at that weight and not to lose weight below it.Thank you"},{"Patient":"Hi, I m 51 yrs old male had a kidney transplant 3 yrs ago and I am diabetic.

In 2009, I had a small 3-4 mm kidney stone and I think it got washed away after taking medicines and drinking fluids as the pain subsided, however am not sure as I didnot go for a second ultrasound. In 2010, I had a right kidney stone around 5-6 mm for which I had taken plenty of fluids and medicines. In 2012, again I had a right upper ureteric calculus 18*10mm with proximal mild hydroureteranephrosis  along with a tiny 3-4 mm right renal calculus ( I underwent a ct scan then)..I underwent Right PCNL + DJ stenting under GA for removal of the right upper ureteric calculus . Last week again I had severe back and abdominal pain on the right side.I underwent again a CT scan of the KUB region, this time scan revealed 6*5 mm right renal upper calyceal calculus along with a tiny left renal calculus.

Some pathology with the spinal cord, some impingment of nerves can cause this altered sensation and other symptoms.

Usually in chronic kidney disease, the size of kidneys shrink.Does he have any other complaints? Like decrease in urine output? Or swelling over feet or face?Sometime even with age the kidney size can shrink a little bit.I would suggest if there are no other complaints associated, no need to worry about the size of kidney.

It's also called end stage kidney disease(ESRD).Normally,dialysis is urgent, as dialysis is like an artificial kidney.You should convince him about need for dialysis, as body wastes are filtered through the kidney, into the urine.At his age , with so many other medical problems, it's even more urgent.If you've any other doubts, you may send your question here, in my name."},{"Patient":"sir, My sister suffering from upper abdomen pain accompanied with vomiting since last one month. Pain last for 4-5 hours . After radiology, endoscopy and blood test and sonography   it is found that she have kidney stone. Can this pain may be due to kidney stone as kidney stone pain occur in lower abdomen","Doctor":"Hello, the pain of a kidney stone depends on the place where it is situated. We call it as referred pain. If the stone is higher up in kidneys it can cause pain in upper abdomen. Similarly if stone is stuck in lower ureters or nearby then pain comes in lower abdomen as you said rightly.  So pain is in upper abdomen probably because stone is in kidney and causing pain.Regarding vomiting, when kidney tries to push the stone downwards it causes typical pain called as colic. Here we would call it as renal colic. In most of the colic pains, vomiting is commonly seen as there is spasm of muscular structures of body trying to reduce the causative factor of vomiting. Hence the vomiting.I hope she must have been started on the required treatment by the treating doctors and I have helped you answering your query. Thank you"},{"Patient":"Does it cost money?

I suppose your doctor must have put you on antihypertensive medications. For your condition not to worsen, few things are very important. First is taking medications regularly. You should not skip any medication given for high BP or delay the timings.Second thing is taking proper diet, low salt diet, less oily food, low cholesterol food will keep your blood pressure and blood cholesterol in control which is essential.Third and important thing is exercise.

If it is so, normal range is of creatinine is upto 1.2. As far as the report is concerned, 1.17 and 1.28 wont make much difference, they are pretty much in normal range. You are already taking anti hypertensive medications for your BP which you should take regularly.Keep yourself well hydrated with water, and repeat serum creatinine after 15 days to check whether values have gone up or down.If it is increased it might suggest some kidney damage going on and you need to see a nephrologist for the same.I hope i have answered your query. thank you"},{"Patient":"I'm on several edications for kidney disease and high blood pressure.

If you are diabetic or hypertensive, you need to keep it under control and under check.I don’t know your diabetic status or hypertensive status so I can’t comment on diet you can have.There is no medication as such for CKD, it’s just preventing other comorbidities to get worse which directly or indirectly causes worsening of kidney functions.You can continue to monitor your creatinine levels every 15 20 days and keep your diet under control.

In surgery some time bleeding can occur in which state the patient undergoing surgery should have a heart strong enough to handle the blood loss and decreasing volume.

Regards Anoop","Doctor":"Hello Anoop and welcome to HCM.As an Urologist, i must appreciate , that you're a health conscious person.Gout is due to a high uric acid level in the blood, which also can form stones.You'll need to check blood calcium, uric acid ,urine routine test and get an ultrasound scan, to know if any stone has formed in kidney or below it.According to reports, if uric acid is high, you'll need to start treatment.In the mean time, drink 12-15 glasses liquids daily.You're welcome to send a copy of reports here, in my name, for an expert opinion.    Wish you well."},{"Patient":"I am 48 years old and have had kidney stones since I was 19.  I just recently had lithrotripsy to take care of a 14 mm stone.  Sometimes I can feel them pass, sometimes I cannot.  Does this mean my ureters are damaged or scarred?  Also, how many CT scans are too many.  I seem to average about 4 a year.  Also, I have already had a parathyroidectomy and watch my diet.  Any ideas?","Doctor":"Hello and welcome to HCM.As an Urologist, let me advise you, that as a stone former, you need CT- scan (plain), once a year. ESWL is ideal for kidney stones upto 2.5 cms size. Stones above 1 cm size or causing pain need treatment.The fragments do no harm to ureter.  If stent is placed,(optional only),it can injure the ureter.  Drink 12-15 glasses liquids daily.You should be more careful after para-thyroidectomy, as small stones need no treatment.  You must have done blood calcium,phosphorus, and uric acid.You're welcome to send a copy of your reports, with last CT, here, in my name, for an expert opinion.    Get well soon."},{"Patient":"I am suffering from nephrotic syndrome... my doctor have prescribed me all type of tablets.. finally i am taking renalog and losartan 50 mg tablet... due to my family background i cant able to buy renalog tablet instead of that can i take ranitide tablet given by gov.hospital? plz reply sir..","Doctor":"hello, renalog is medication is an essential amino acid supplement and losartan is an anti hypertensive group of medication. but the medication is you are asking, ranitide, what is the content of it?

You might need to readjust the dosage of prograf after a test called as ' zero hour tacrolimus levels' which is done early morning before you take the dose of prograf. If the levels come above normal range that means you are taking high dosage of prograf and you might need to reduce it after consulting your nephrologist.

I just don t like to remember;( my question is this lately her stomach has grown but she is retaining too much fluidly lately about a month ago she hurt her leg causing a sore to not heal. Just today after dialysis her leg started to throb with excruciating pain and I know it s because her legs are swollen.. She weighed in today at 69.8 and when she did her 4 hrs she was 67.4.. What is going on? Should I worry? Or is this normal.. I went to her general doctor and they said, it s part of the dialysis. I almost didn t like the answer. Even the discoloration in her legs is getting worse. I noticed her fistula sight has 2 moused sized bumps and we have had them checked. But why did they get this way and why didn t the techs prevent them from happening? What should I do?","Doctor":"hello, kidney's main function as you know is producing urine which is not happening right now. So in between the dialysis sessions, the fluid accumulates in body as it cant be excreted out due to decreased function of kidney. i would suggest that her daily fluid intake should not exceed 800 ml to 1000 ml. by doing this you reduce the amount of fluid she takes in thus reducing fluid accumulation. Now about the bumps in fistula site, there is fistula formation between artery and vein at that site. This causes direct blood flow from artery to vein in that particular area. As veins cant sustain the pressure of arterial blood flow in them directly, they distend which causes bump formation. This is seen commonly in patients undergoing dialysis so no need to wory about it. I hope I have answered your questions. thank you"},{"Patient":"I think I may have a kidney stone, what is the best option for pain relief or should I go to er if pain gets u nbearable?

If at all its present, the size of the stone, number of stone(s), site of the stone all this information we can get and which can help for proper diagnosis and treatment for the same.  Regarding the question about blood in urine, if stone is present and if its eroding the wall of kidney, ureter or bladder it can cause blood in urine.

Blood appeared in and around her mouth. Could you tell me why the blood? I understand she went peacefully.","Doctor":"Sorry to hear about the demise. In patients undergoing dialysis and having stopped there could be multiple reasons for bleeding. Theses patients have bleeding tendencies so she might have bled from any ulcer in stomach or esophagus. Or if due to stopping of the dialysis, she might have developed pulmonary hypertension due to accumulation of excessive fluids in lungs and cause bleeding through lungs which might have surfaced during excessive bought of cough containing blood. These could be the main reasons that i think of from what you have told me in your question. thank you"},{"Patient":"sir, MY cousin brother is suffered by kidney problem and joined at Guntur Andhra pradesh hospital they told that one kidney is fully damaged and other one is partially damaged what can i do for the next step?

So there is nothing to worry about the creat levels if there are no other symptoms associated with it. I would suggest you to do routine creatinine levels aftr 3 -4 weeks. If there is rise of creatinine at that time kindly refer to a nephrologist then. Otherwise it could be his base line creatinine which is nothing to be worried about. I hope i have helped your query.

His kidneys have reached damage of about 80%. I would suggest you to consult a nephrologist because he might require dialysis atleast once or twice till his creatinine comes to normal range or his baseline ie. 2. Then if it gets managed solely on medications he will just need to regularly keep check on his creatinine levels. I hope i have helped your question.

Is that really possible?","Doctor":"Hello, creatinine levels of 8 means there is already 80%+ damage to the kidneys. Some times some patient after doing 1 or 2 dialysis can revert to better functioning of the kidneys and they wont require any further dialysis and can be managed only on medicines. But creat of 8 does needs dialysis to get the accumulated toxic products out of the body so kidneys could restart their functioning. So i would suggest to go with the advice of your nephrologist and undergo dialysis and then follow up regularly.

As the GFR of your husband is below normal, he's on dialysis.GFR reflects kidney function.

That means the stone is in such a position that ismts not causing any obstruction to the outflow of the urine and hence is not a reason to be worried about. But in future if you get left flank side pain radiating towards back you should show to a doctor as it means the stone might have been obstructing the flow.

For your problem of recurring kidney stone which according to what you said are not troubling you, you could just consult a dietician because many times modifying diet also can reduce recurrence of kidney stones. For high blood sugars also you need to modify your diet and should have low sugar diet and moderate amount of exercise. I feel you should consult a dietician for your both problems.

Kidney and the liver. Do you have any other associated symptoms along with the pain? If you only have pain in that region i would suggest you undergo a simple USG scan of abdomen.

Ultrasound being done tomorrow. He does have prostate issues also and is on flomax for this. Is it normal to have a higher creatinine post op?","Doctor":"Hello, yes after a nephrectomy sometimes s. Creatinine goes up. That is beacuse after removal of a part or a total kidney the other kidney has to work and compensate for the removed one. It will usually increase in size to compensate. Creat levels are found to go bit higher after surgery but in a matter of 3 to 4 weeks they come back to normal levels. So i would suggest let him undergo the USG tomorrow and wait for 2 more weeks for creat to come to normal. If it doesnt then you need to see the nephrologist.

There is a stent inserted for atleast 3 weeks. My question here is Will smoking Pot will affect my kidneys or stent inside me?","Doctor":"HelloIn my view smoking is harmful to anyone and in your case it's more dangerous. Post surgery your wound healing process take sometime with right nutrition,rest&vitamin supplements to encourage collegen formation it will be more quick.Where as,smoking,retard wound healing through impairing tissue oxygenation.If the oxygen supply is effected you will have slow wound healing and may even cause bacterial growth as Nicotine causes blood flow to slow down by constricting the vessels.To prevent all the possible complications my advice; if i were you treating doctor would be to avoid smoking at least till you recover.Hope your question is answered."},{"Patient":"Hi, I have renal hypertension & FSGS I also have a few UTI's & kindney stones but they were really small only 4mm.

You should get an urine routine and culture,micro-albumin,blood kidney function tests, sugar, and ultrasound scan of abdomen done and see your doctor.You may contact me by name, if you've any other doubt.Get well soon."},{"Patient":"Hi I am a 27yr old Female suffering from bladder and kidney reflux aswell as severe kidney problems .I have been going through this disease for 6 years now. It started off as severe continual kidney infections which I was hospitalised for each time and doctors could not explain why I was continually getting infections. The infections were always in my left hand side Kidney which always showed on ultra sounds as large and swollen ( Hydronephrosis). I was then hospitalised with severe pain on the left hand side flank pain ( front kidney pain) which came up on an ultrasound and CT scan as a Large PUJ Obstruction( a kink in ureter tube which is the tube that comes of your kidney and joins to your bladder) I had numerous stents put in to release obstruction which was only a temporally fix as I was getting infections in stents. I was then booked in by a urologist to have a pleyoplasty surgery done on my left hand kidney. At this time my right hand kidney only had a mild case of Hydronephrosis on it and a propionate renal pelvis with no PUJ Obstruction on it so the concentration was mainly on my left hand kidney. The pleyoplasty went well and urologists were convinced that my condition was fixed. Exactly to the day a year after my surgery my left hand completely obstructed again and I was hospitalised 7 times to the emergency department with extreme pain in 2 weeks I had multiple scans and nuclear medicine studies done which showed my left hand kidney completely obstructed they then booked me in for a ballon dilation which was unsuccessful and I was in the public hospital system as I had no health insurance so waiting times were very long I was put on very high pain killers to get me through the day and waiting times I then reached out to a different urologist which rushed me in for a procedure which inserted a camera inside my bladder and kidney to have a look they also inserted another stent and booked me in for yet another pleyoplasty which this time was a larger operation. This operation was not successful and I was told that my left hand kidney had to be removed I was devastated but I knew it had to be done. I was ok for about 6 months after the removal then the same things started happening to my remanding kidney but it was obstructing and releasing they were stumped I was in and out of hospital all the time with severe fluid retention and pain. I was hospitalised for 3 weeks to have numerous tests done to find out why this was happening. I had a urodyamics test done which shows the pressure in your bladder and how you empty your bladder. It was then I was diagnosed with a rare bladder condition which doesn t have a name all I was told is I have extreme pressure in my bladder and when I go to the toilet I only empty a 1/4 of what is in my bladder and the rest reflux back up into my kidney which is causing my bladder to blow out my remanding kidney. I was then told I wasn t eligible for a transplant as my bladder would damage any donor kidney I received. I need help and it has taken along time for me to feel comfortable to talk about my disease as I know there are a lot more people out there with worst disease then mine. I was just wondering if there are any other people out there suffering from similar problems and have had it fixed as I am having difficulties finding surgical help or if anybody needs to talk about their health issues as I know it s hard to deal with severe health problems not only health wise but mentally as severe continuos pain can make people feel like they are going insane. I try to wake up every morning and stay positive and smile through the pain and feeling unwell all the time. I can not work due to my health issues and it gets me down all the time but I stay positive and hope there is light at the end of the tunnel.","Doctor":"Hello and welcome to HCM.As an Urologist, i can fully understand the trauma you're undergoing.If you can send the latest discharge summary with scans, kidney function tests, and the urodynamic tests and all reports, present medication, i can certainly give you an expert opinion regarding further treatment.Failure after second pyeloplasty, for re-stricture of PUJO, is well known.Send them in my name.Keep a positive attitude.

I lost one of my kidneys at 63 years old due to a very small non-malignant tumor called an oncocytoma. Everything I read said they are slow growing and never spread, the surgeon stated the same thing. It grew only slightly after waiting a year. He decided we needed to get it out anyway through surgery. However, after surgery, he told me that due to seeing more cells in the margins around the tumor, he decided to act aggressively and removed my entire kidney.?? So they do spread!! I was in surgery 6 hours and doctor came out and told my waiting family she has renal cell carcinoma as I m sure you know a deadly form of kidney cancer. The next day he came into my room smiling and said guess what.....it was a non-malignant tumor. Why was it spreading after he had even said they never spread, but can grow larger but are slow growing. I m mad as hell, because of late, I m reading that it is possible to find out if a kidney mass is malignant by pinching a small piece of it off by going through the skin with a long probe to reach kidney to remove a piece of mass, before invasive surgery. The tumor was very small, we waited one year and it grew only slightly. It has ruined my life. I m always worried my single kidney will fail. I know that there are many people living with only one kidney, but it has ruined my life. Doctor admitted when I asked, could I get another oncocytoma in my single kidney left. He said it is more likely now since you had one in left kidney. I cannot happily go on living because of constant worry about what I eat, drink, preservatives in some foods, vitamins, prescriptions I must take. I absolutely will not go on dialysis if this happens. I just turned 70 and no one will donate a kidney to me due to age. In retrospect, I should have sued the hell out of the doctor for how he handled my case. There was a pathologist in the surgery room who apparently looked under the scope and told the doctor he believed it was renal cell, so told doctor to proceed aggressively. He told me later that by the time he cleared the margins, that there was not enough of my kidney left, so he removed the entire kidney. I m depressed all the time, can t sleep well anymore and truthfully ready to meet my maker. I ve seen therapists of all sorts, been on medications to ease my anxiety, but to no avail. Now I m in chronic pain all over my body and taking oxycodone which I m sure will take out my only kidney, (prescribing doctor) didn t mention how it is metabolized, and I didn t ask. I m at a point that I don t care anymore and have become a complete recluse in my small house. I don t really don t know what I am asking of you. I guess to validate that you would feel the same way or something along that line. Don t wish to submit reports at this time, but will if you need them.

Sunday she was in the ER with a Potassium I V and her blood work shows continual decrease in potassium levels!  Cardiology and Kidney Specialist are baffled.  Is this something that an endocrinologist might be able to help with","Doctor":"Hi, Thanks for your question. Hypokalemia (low potassium) may be due to potassium loss either throough gastrointestinal tract (vomitting or loose motions) or loss through kidney in urine. Potassium loss through kidney is more important as it requires differant types of evaluation. Potassium loss through kidney may be due to 1) Drug induced : Certain drugs like diuretics may cause low potassium. 2) Kidney diseases: Renal tubular diseses or Kidney failure by differant causes may cause low potassium. 3) Endocrinological causes: Hormonal imbalnces which are related to potassium and sodium balance may cause low potassium. So it requires evaluation in consultation with endocrinologist, nephrologist and cardiologist.

For focal seizures, I would recommend levetiracetam or lamotrigine, considering that she is a young girl. Other treatment options would be carbamazepine and topiramate.

I read your question carefully and I understand your concern. From the signs and symptoms you prescribe it is a possibility that you have a Pyelonephritis. That was also the suspicion in the ER. I would like to know if you did any lab or imaging studies or did in the ER prescribe medication for further treatment? I also would like to know your age and if you have any chronic disorders that would complicate the treatment like diabetes, chronic lung or heart diseases). This is important because if your diagnosis is confirmed, in some cases there is a necessity for hospital admission.  I recommend to you to do the following workup: urinalysis (with microscopic analysis), urine culture, CBC and ultrasound of the kidneys and bladder. Regarding the therapy, if the diagnosis is confirmed and if you will be selected for outpatient treatment, you require initially a vigorous IV or oral fluids, paracetamol for fever and a dose of parenteral antibiotic. Then you need a antibiotic therapy at least 7 days in uncomplicated cases and the recommended first line therapy is ciprofloxacin. I hope my answer was helpful to you.

Both conditions are presently well-controlled. On September 9 of this year, blood test revealed eGFR of 57, creatine 1.36, calcium 10.8. My physician told me I was mildly anemic (I told her that I had eaten any meat for 9 months) and she said she d test again in 3 months (end of November). She also said she suspected I was dehydrated and she directed me to resume eating meat and to report for biweekly B-12 shots. Blood test results taken during work-related physical on October 3 indicated eGFR of 54, creatine 1.36 (again) and calcium 10.8 (again). Showed second set of results to my physician who told me not to be too concerned and to await follow-up blood test scheduled for end of November. She doesn t believe I have CKD at this point and feels that the totality of my bloodwork doesn t justify this diagnosis. She stated that eGFR values can move up and down given many factors at time of testing. I have read that once eGFR diminishes, it cannot recover...Doctor, is it possible that I don t yet have kidney disease? And is it possible for eGFR to improve?","Doctor":"Hi, I appreciate your concerns.The risk factors for CKD in your case are diabetes and blood pressure of long duration. If the GFR remains below 60 for a duration of 3 months we label it as CKD stage 2. If you have significant amount of protein in the urine most likely you have kidney dysfunction secondary to diabetes. But there is nothing to worry as we have diagnosed it early and if taken precautions the eGFR can be maintained for a long time. The key to prevent further progression at this point is a good control of blood  sugar and blood presure, weight reduction and regular follow up. The anemia is most likely secondary to nutritional deficiency as you are already taking vitamin supplements.I will e pleased to take any queries from you.Tx"},{"Patient":"I fell down a few steps and i am in a lot of pain on my right side..bruise on my hip but i have a lot of pain and its tender around my kidney...it hurts to cough and breathe a little.

He is taking BP medicine since last 10 years.","Doctor":"It is not uncommon as we get older that our blood vessels continue to become stiffer, and as a result our blood pressure goes up, even if you are on medications. That being said, there are other causes for elevated blood pressure beyond old age. If this happens to be the first time your father's blood pressure is this high, and that this is unusual for him, sometimes the blood pressure can be falsely high from things as simple as a wrong sized blood pressure cuff, crossing your legs while getting your measurement, or even having your blood pressure measured on a full bladder, among other things. So next time he gets his blood pressure measured, make sure he is calm, that he has been sitting for at least 5 minutes, with an empty bladder and legs uncrossed. Other than having his blood pressure medication doses adjusted, if your father is particularly overweight or eats a lot of salty foods, aiming to reduce your salt intake and also losing as little as 10 pounds can cause your blood pressure to reduce in some instances. Foods especially to avoid include canned soups, pickles, chips, frozen dinners, sandwich meats, ramen noodles.

If your husband is having grade 3 kidney disease it means that the ability of the kidneys to remove creatinine and uric acid from the blood is reduced. This is causing above normal uric acid and creatinine in the circulation and is seen when his blood sample is evaluated for these metabolic products.Gout is a different condition where there is primary hyperuricemia and deposition of uric acid crystals in joints.

Your daughter requires to be investigated for kidney disease immediately as all the mentioned symptoms might be related to each other.When there is narrowing of the arteries supplying blood to the kidneys, there renin angiotensin system gets stimulated. As a result this causes the kidneys to release chemicals which cause high blood pressure. At the same time there is a chemical called erythropoietin which is also released and this causes stimulation of bone marrow to generate more red blood cells. The high blood pressure causes stress on the kidneys and then the kidney function is affected which is seen as increased creatinine. Please consult a nephrologist and discuss her health condition.

Raised creatinine levels are due to kidney problems. The liver has a normal function of detoxification in our body. When the red blood cells get old, they are destroyed in the liver and the hemoglobin pigment is salvaged. Hemoglobin breaks down in to heme pigment which is converted to bile and secreted.When the red cell destruction is higher then more bilirubin is generated and the bilirubin levels are increased. Bilirubin exists as conjugated and unconjugated forms. Both together make total bilirubin. Your bilirubin level is marginally increased and not a serious concern.

Usually if I m severely dehydrated, my urine would turn a very dark yellow","Doctor":"Hi,I am Dr ali and I am a Urologist.In my opinion yes kidney impairment causes brown colored urine, usually it is blood in urine called hematuria. Main function of the kidneys is to filtrate blood from toxic body material and excrete in the form of urine. Blood supply to kidney itself is reduced in case of dehydration and its filtration process is effected and blood is passed in urine instead of clearing it.It is reversible once rehydration is done.regards"},{"Patient":"Hi, I have had a stent put in in April 26.And I am going to have kidney surgery on the 30 of April.

Beets consumption can cause urine discoloration or reddish / dark urine. This will be gone in a day or two. In the meantime drink plenty of water around 2-3 liters.

If you are feeling better than when you were admitted then I would say that you just need to let your body heal and rest for 2 more weeks. If ÿou feel,like you are getting worse then a follow up checkup with your doctor is prudent. He may have to do a urinalysis to check the status of your infection.

All the typical symptoms were present- painful & burning urination, frequent urge to go, dull pelvic pain, etc. I treated it with the typical home remedies (increased water intake, cranberry juice, and OTC urinary supplements) that usually take care of it fairly quickly. After two days, I was almost back to normal when suddenly I noticed my urine looked like straight blood from a vein (I was not menstrating), and I had moderate flank pain. So the next morning I went to a clinic knowing it had gotten into my kidneys. After the nurse practitioner collected the urine sample, she came to the same conclusion that it was a complicated UTI which had traveled to my kidneys. She prescribed Ciprofloxacin, but sent the sample in for culture testing anyways. After two days on the Cipro, the majority of my symptoms cleared up. But then the clinic called me back and left a voicemail saying the culture test came back negative for any infection/bacteria, although my there was a high level of protein in my urine, and I could discontinue the use of my prescriptions. I did as they said, and the burning & bloody urination never returned. However, to this day my kidneys are still swollen and tender. A few days ago, I also noticed there is now a bruise directly over my left kidney. I have not passed any kidney stones, nor do I feel as though I will. Any ideas on what could cause this? Should I see a doctor?","Doctor":"Good Day and thank you for being with Healthcare Magic! Yes a consult with a urologist is necessary in your case. I would also urge to get a KUB ultrasound or a ct scan to check for stones or rumors. Blood I the urine is always a distressing symptom and warrants further testing.

What is happening?","Doctor":"helloThanks for query.You have stent in your renal unit placed while doing surgery for removing kidney stone ..The shocking sensation in chest while passing urine is due to fact that while passing urine some amount of urine passes up through the lumen of stent back into kidney which distends the pelvis of the kidney giving rise to refereed pain in chest and around the kidney area.Do not worry this will go away once the stent is removed.Dr.Patil."},{"Patient":"My husband has a kidney stone. He had a procedure 2 weeks ago to put a stent in.I was told the stone was just outside the kidney, too high up to be grabbed and too close to the kidney to be lasered. He went back today to get stent removed and hopefully get the stone out. During the procedure found that the stone had gone back into the kidney so they blasted it. Came home with another stent to be removed in 3 days. Why could the stone not be blasted 2 weeks ago and is there a difference between blasting and laser?","Doctor":"HelloThanks for query.Your husband has stone in his kidney probably in upper calyx which is techniquely very difficult to be accessed by rigid endoscopes ,that may perhaps be reason for it not being fragmented in first sitting.After putting the stent the entire ureter undergoes passive dilatation making endoscopes to be negotiated freely through dilated ureter during second sitting and stone can be fragmented easily.In blasting we use pneumatic energy to fragment the stone where as in laser surgery we use  laser energy to burn the stone .It is risky to use laser in kidney if the stone is very close to cortex and  there is risk of damaging the kidney tissue.Dr.Patil."},{"Patient":"Sir, i am suffering from swating & ghabrahat from 15 days whent i consul the dr my bp is 170/106 ecg is normal after the taking medicine  position are same in swating & ghabrahat butbp is 140/96 rcg again is normal dr told me oxygen is not properly going in heart he suggest me for eco presently i am in satna madhya pradesh pls suggest me what i can do","Doctor":"High B.P taken on one or two ocassions and sweating does not necessarily mean that you may be having a heart problem. More than 90% of high B.P has no obvious underlying cause. If you feel any shortness of breath, chest pain, racing or sinking of heart beat then it may point towards underlying heart problem.

Now I'm giving details about your concern:- The main risk factor is hypercalciuria. Do you have members of your family which has same problem as you? Hypercalciuria means that serum cacium is normal but elevated urinary calcium.- Other factors can be primary or caused by excess ingestion of oxalate containing foods (eg, rhubarb, spinach, cocoa, nuts, pepper, tea) or by excess oxalate absorption due to various enteric diseases (eg, bacterial overgrowth syndromes, chronic pancreatic or biliary disease) or ileojejunal surgery. Other risk factors include taking high doses of vitamin C, a Ca-restricted diet (possibly because dietary Ca binds dietary oxalate)- Clitoral stimulation may be a good support, well it's known that body endorphines after stimulation are a good support for accepting the pain, but it doen't help to move the stone along urethra. you should take the painkiller for urinary colic.- If I was your doctor I would prescribe a thiazide diuretic to prevent calcium stones.

To really determine if there is infection in the urine, you'll have to do a urine culture. This is the gold standard to confirm a urine infection. Blood in the urine may accompany pus cells.

I have read your question thoroughly.Regarding ramipril, yes it can cause dizzy spells owing to its blood pressure lowering effect, but it does not cause sharp pain in the neck.As you have been an anxiety sufferer and a smoker as well, the sharp pain in the neck is probably, either a PSYCHOSOMATIC PAIN which means that patient feels pain in the absence of any medical explaination and in the absence of physical and biochemical evidence, or it is a MUSCULOSKELETAL PAIN which means either a faulty sleeping position or a wrong exercising technique is causing it. the best way to proceed is as;1: To have regular blood pressure check ups to see if the it's the lower BP that is causing the dizzy spells. 2: To reduce smoking as much as possible which is helpful for the treatment of both Hypertension and anxiety disorder. 3: To have regular brisk walk and have healthy activities like exercising for half an hour a day that would help in reducing anxiety and ultimately will have pain alleviating effect. 4: To adopt a healthy diet, rich in vegetables, fruits, low fat content foods, fish and intermediate glycemic index foods that would speed up the treatment process alongside the other measures.

The physician reading the results sent the technician back to ask if I have ever had kidney disease. I had several bouts of pyelonephritis as a 6-12 year old. (40 years ago) It seems that I have marked asymmetrical absorption of the material between my two kidneys. The technician added that one kidney showed lots of activity while the other one was barely visible . The report recommended clinical eval and an ultrasound. What are the possibilities here?","Doctor":"HI,Thanks for writing in.The most convincing possibility in your report findings is that due to the pyelonephritis 40 years back there was scarring in the kidney. This has caused mild permanent scarring leading to decreased functioning in one of the kidneys. This is not a serious condition and the kidney function has been taken care of by both the kidneys and this is the reason one kidney is showing reduced activity.When doing a complete bone scan, the material injected is excreted through the kidneys and the concentration of the radio isotope in the kidney reflects its absorption. Since on of your kidneys is showing reduced absorption of the radio isotope material, it means that due to scar formation 40 years back, the kidney function is reduced. If your kidney function tests such as serum creatinine and creatinine clearance is within the normal range then there is no concern. Please do not worry."},{"Patient":"I am very concerned for my 73 year old friend. She was very sick a few days ago throwing up bile.

This happens through a complicated process in the kidneys and involve stages like glomerular filtration. This is a micro system that causes blood components to flow through small and the main filtration occurs at basement membrane in the glomerulus. When there is proteins seen in the urine in higher quantities than normal then a problem in the basement membrane must be suspected. This also might happen in those who have had nephritis earlier in their life.Your kidney functions might be above normal and it is important to evaluate the excretion of proteins by doing a biopsy.

A CT scan for kidney stones is a detailed investigation and will show stones even 2 mm in size. It is possible that since you have many stones in the kidney, one or two such stones might leave the kidney and travel down the ureters towards the urinary bladder. In this way, the stones can cause bruising of the ureter and then this causes pain and bleeding which is seen as hematuria. You do not have to live with this kind of pain for a long time.

It shows that there is a problem related to filtration of the proteins in the kidney basement membrane. The basement membrane also known as glomerular basement membrane plays an important part in not allowing protein molecules to pass through. In diseases of kidneys, this basement membrane can no longer control the amount of proteins passing in urine. It is important to repeat kidney function tests regularly and confirm the diagnosis on doing ultrasound guided renal biopsy if recommended by the nephrologist. Treatment is strictly based on the findings at biopsy and might include steroids and medications used in treating post infective autoimmune diseases affecting kidneys. Please discuss with your doctors and follow diet changes as suggested."},{"Patient":"Is there any link between kidney failure and HCG? 23yr old female, have HCG levels, 3 positive pregnancy tests, HCG level 4 two days ago, redone blood test today.

You condition is understandable but it is important that you continue to live and forget about ending your life in this manner. I am sure there are a lot of friends and relative who are there to support you at all times and help you out with your pain.It would appear that the lethal level of amlodipine is in the range of 40 milligrams per kilogram.

You have done the right thing by getting urine culture and sensitivity test done and started taking nitrofurantoin since yesterday. This medication acts on the bacteria and should be taken for a short course without breaks for 5 days to kill the bacteria. The medication requires at least 2 days for you to start feeling better which happens when the bacterial count starts reducing after taking the medication. The slight kidney pain might be due to urinary infection itself. You can continue taking medications as prescribed and also drink plenty of juices and fresh fluids. Please do not hold urine and visit washrooms regularly. Also you should be careful in toilet seats in public toilets before using it.If your pain increases in severity in the next few days and gets more localized near the kidney area then getting an ultrasound scan is suggested."},{"Patient":"I have 25% function in my left kidney and have passed many stones, the last stone blocked the Uretha and had to be blasted.

That is the possible reason for your kidney functioning at 75 percent. A stone of size 35 mm is big and should be removed to maintain the remaining functioning of the kidney. There are surgical as well as minimally invasive ways to treat your condition. A percutaneous nephrolithotomy can be done. In this an incision is made in the kidney region and the staghorn calculus is removed surgically. Extracorporeal shockwaves can be used to break the stones. Otherwise a double J stent can be kept in place to maintain the flow of urine while attempts can be made to allow the stone to be removed piecemeal.

To confirm if you really have an enlarged prostate, you should get an ultrasound scan done and this must also include urinary bladder volumes before and after urination. An enlarged prostate causes retention of urine in many people and that is responsible for increased frequency of urination and urgency. Symptoms of an enlarged prostate includes, urinary urge, increased frequency of urination even in the night, pain during urination and sometimes blood in urine. Significant retention of urine can cause urinary tract infection also. It will help if you also get PSA (prostate specific antigen) levels tested at least once every year. This will show any risk of developing prostate cancer.Mild prostate enlargement is treated with medications like finastride and tamsulosin.

In my opinion, 300 can be 300 mg to the upper limit of proteins normally excreted by an individual and 5000 refers to 5 grams of proteins found in his test results. Please remember that this is only an estimation and it is best to refer to the actual report and make conclusions.A blood pressure of 180/ 108 is high and it is important to rule out a condition called renal artery stenosis in people having high blood pressure. In this condition, there is narrowing of blood vessels entering the kidneys and this causes release of chemicals that shoot up the blood pressure.

What can I do","Doctor":"Hi,Thanks for writing in.A stone getting stuck in the urethra can be painful. I would like to reconfirm if the stone is in the urethra or the versico ureteric junction as these are two different locations and might be treated in different ways.1. If the stone is confirmed to be lodged in the urethra then it can be easily removed by inserting a cystoscope. This is minimally invasive with complete success.2. If the stone if stuck in the vesico ureteric junction then(i) Drinking as much as 1.5 to 2.5 liters) a day may help flush out your urinary system. This will also allow the stone to enter the bladder.(ii) Please consult your urologist and they might give you a prescription for a medication of alpha blocker group which will push the stone forwards.(iv) If you are having pain and burning during passing urine then you can take ALKASOL syrup 15-30 ml twice or thrice daily, dissolved in water for one week. This will prevent acidic urine and stone formation.(v) If you have sharp pain then you can take tablet containing hyoscine (eg HYOCIMAX 10 mg or HYSCOPAN 10 mg) twice a day for 2 to 3 days, till you have pain.

I suggested she cut down on liquids during late evening might be helpful. She also feels the kidneys cause diarrhea and constipation also causes the problem with the kidneys. no diabetes. 78 years","Doctor":"Hi,Thanks for writing in.An overactive bladder is usually due to the muscles at the bladder mouth, though anxiety and the autonomic nervous system in the kidneys can give rise to an overactive bladder. Though kidney function is not directly connected to diarrhea and constipation, it is possible that decreased water intake can cause constipation. However taking slightly larger amounts of water and fluids will never cause diarrhea. Studies have reported that natural changes in the urinary tract may account for some of the apparent increase in lower urinary tract symptoms with increasing age. The sensation of bladder filling is reduced and bladder capacity falls, leading to an older person having less time to respond to the call to urinate and perhaps explaining why many older people complain of severe urge."},{"Patient":"Could you please tell me in lay terms what this means?

Small kidneys with diffuse increased echogenicity of renal parenchyma billaterally and loss of corticomedullary differentiation. Likely related to chronic medical renal disease.This means that the kidneys have slightly shrunken in size and the appearance of the renal cortex is increased. In other words, the kidneys have started to function below normal and this might be related to conditions like diabetes or high blood pressure should you be having either or both of them.2. Mild to moderate left pelvicalyceal dilatation with mild thickening of urothelium.The left kidney shows a suspected block in the collecting system and also the thickening of the lining of tubes connecting the kidney to the bladder on the left side.The above findings are indicative of a decreasing kidney function. This needs to be reviewed by a nephrologist and they might suggest further testing to know the quantitative functioning of kidneys by doing tests like creatinine clearance and radioisotope renal function. Treatment is based on controlling any other medical condition that you might have and delaying the progression of renal failure by giving medicines."},{"Patient":"I have a right kidney measuring 11.4 cm and left measuring 9.5cm in length does this mean I have a problem I have 2 stones measuring 0.4 cm in rt. kidney and am sore on my right upper quadrant that feels like a small walnut should I be worried,ultrasound did not address this it is sore and somethimes have sharp pain. Janet","Doctor":"Hi,Thanks for writing in.I guess you have got ultrasound scan done for your kidneys and that shows a slight difference in the sizes. In normal individuals, the sizes of kidneys when compared, can differ by about 2.0 cm and this is acceptable. Since your kidneys are within the acceptable range of difference in size therefore it is not a concern.The kidney stones need to be treated after consulting the urologist. Two stones each measuring 0.4 cm in the right kidney are not a serious problems unless there is obstruction. As you are having pain also, it is important to consult your doctor and take anti spasmodic medications to relieve the pain. Drinking lots of water and visiting washrooms frequently is recommended to flush the stones out of your system. If the stones have entered the ureters and are on their way to the urinary bladder then you might experience a sharp and severe pain lasting for hours to days. This must be confirmed first and usually treated by giving medications of alpha blockers group which cause the stone to move forwards and reduce the pain."},{"Patient":"I had an ultrasound that says that I have mild right hydronephrosis.

I have thyroid issues and want to avoid contrast. Aren t there other tests that can be done to diagnose me? Cystoscopy? Please advise.","Doctor":"Hi,Thanks for writing in.A mild hydronephrosis in kidneys can be due to the following causes.(i) It can be that your bladder was completely full at the of ultrasound scan(ii) Your kidney pelvicalyceal system is appearing full by itself (extrarenal pelvis) and is an extension of normal appearance.(iii) Rarely an infection of urinary system and kidneys (recent or old) can cause such a finding but this is likely only if you have symptoms like pain in the region of kidney and problems like burning urination or discoloration of urine or any kidney infections in the past.(iv) Stones in kidney or ureter can also cause fullness of pelvicalyceal system and since you do not have any stone therefore this does not apply to you.If your doctor wants a CT scan to see only stones then giving contrast is not required. Stones can be seen well on CT scan without contrast. Please discuss this matter with your doctors and the radiologists before getting the CT scan done.Most stones are made up of calcium and appear bright on non contrast CT scans. That is sufficient to make a diagnosis.If an infection is suspected then urine culture and sensitivity test is required."},{"Patient":"My father in law is suffering for kidney deases , he is going to three in week for dialysis and now his complain is that he has very pain in pet . from 10 day water is storage in pet, two or three time doctor out water from pet.

Fluid accumulation or ascites in the abdomen is present in many people with kidney disease those who are on dialysis. This happens because of the fluid overload that is not cleared by the kidneys in a normal way. There is also abnormal balance of proteins and fluid in the body that further causes ascites.Any fluid collection within the abdomen gives rise to irritation of the peritoneum causing pain and discomfort. Few people also develop conditions involving dysfunction of liver and heart which increases tendencies of fluid accumulation. The fluid accumulation due to ascites and pain can be controlled by medications.

It is important to know the number and size of the kidney stones. Any obstruction to the passage of urine by the kidney stones is also to be known. Treatment depends on the number, size and and any obstruction that is happening. Consulting the urologist with your report once will help in knowing which treatment is most suitable for you. In general, people with kidney stones are asked to drink lots of water and visit wash rooms regularly. Please reduce foods containing oxalates like non veg, vegetables like spinach, tomato, cauliflower, brinjals, nuts like kaju, pista and almonds. Avoid holding urine for long intervals.For the hernia, you should consult a surgeon and take an opinion on the if the hernia is a small one or a large one.

One of the stones from left kidney has dropped into the ureter (the tube connecting kidney to urinary bladder). Vesicoureteric junction denotes the site where ureter joins with bladder. This has caused mild swelling in the left kidney due to obstruction. Otherwise your kidneys are apparently normal.The stone in ureter usually causes pain in left flank with or without vomiting and burning urination. Usual treatment is an alpha blocker (eg. Tab. Tamsulosin) and pain relieving medications. If the pain does not subside or kidney function deteriorates or infection sets in, then it needs to be removed immediately. Otherwise, the stone can be monitored and if does not pass in 4 weeks then it can be removed using endoscopy (URS, ureterorenoscopy).After treatment for the ureteric stone, you need to be evaluated to find out the cause of stone formation.

A few cysts in the kidneys after the age of 60 years is acceptable and considered normal. In the liver also, small cysts can be seen in most of the population after 60 years of age. Your liver cyst is 1.5 cm and is a small one by size. The location of the cyst in the right and left lobes does not have any significance. If you are in the younger age group then there is a need to repeat the ultrasound scan abdomen after 6 months to know any progressive enlargement in the size of liver cysts. There is no concern for you right now and you can accept your these cysts in your liver as harmless findings. Please do not worry."},{"Patient":"The left Kidney demonstrates mild to moderate pelvicalyceal dilatation. The proximal left ureter is also slightly dilated. left renal length = 11.2cm.impression : Left pelvicalyceal and proximal ureteric dilation?Secondary to ureteric stricture or calculus. IVP advise for further evaluation. other wise normal intra-abdominal findings","Doctor":"Hi,Thanks for writing in.The collecting system of the kidney is made of renal calyces and pelvis. This collects the urine formed in kidney and transports it through the ureter (tubes connecting kidneys and urinary bladder) to the urinary bladder. The pelvicalyceal system is the mouth of the kidney where it connects with the upper end of the ureter.I guess that you have got ultrasound scan done and it shows mild fullness of the pelvicalyceal system in the left kidney, that is a term applied to increase in diameter of the collecting system in your left kidney.It is not a critical situation and please do not worry if you do not have any urinary symptoms. Since it is mentioned as mild fullness and no kidney stones have been found, therefore(i) It can be that your bladder was completely full at the of ultrasound scan(ii) Your kidney pelvicalyceal system is appearing full by itself (extrarenal pelvis) and is an extension of normal appearance.(iii) Rarely an infection of urinary system and kidneys (recent or old) can cause such a finding but this is likely only if you have symptoms like pain in the region of kidney and problems like burning urination or discoloration of urine or any kidney infections in the past.(iv) Stones in kidney or ureter can also cause fullness of pelvicalyceal system and since you do not have any stone therefore this does not apply to you.It is important to know if your scan was repeated after passing urine ans still there was persistent mild fullness of the pelvicalyceal system on left side. This can also be confirmed by doing an IVP which is injecting a contrast and taking 5 to 6 X rays to study the functioning of the kidneys in a better way. Please consult the urologist."},{"Patient":"hi doctor can u please advice me as a close relative who is 21 years old, has a single stone20 mg in the right kidney which broke into two recently, with alleopathy treatment,he is getting swelling, fever, and a lot of pain now and has been adviced surgery,is there an altrernative treatment,Thanks ...","Doctor":"Hi,Thanks for writing in.The stone in kidney might be 20 mm in size. This is a large stone and will not respond to oral medical treatment. Since the stone has been broken to two parts, it is still large and can cause obstruction in the kidneys or urinary tract. The swelling, fever and pain is due to the obstruction and probable infection in the block in passage of urine. It is important that he continues taking allopathy treatment as per instructions of his urologist. If there is hydroureteronephrosis then he must consult his doctors regularly because obstruction to passage of urine for more than ten days can cause obstructive uropathy and this can cause permanent damage to the affected kidney. Doing regular kidney function tests is important. If required inserting a double J stent in to the affected kidney might be needed to restore proper functioning even in the presence of smaller stone fragments after lithotripsy."},{"Patient":"My son has hydronephrosis of his right kidney and has had two surgeries when he was 1 year old. He is now 8 and had a renal scan and the results state that he ha significant pelvicalyceal retention on the right which clears following lasix administration. Should we be concerned with the findings?","Doctor":"Hi,Thanks for writing in.Your son might have had congenital hydronephrosis in the right kidney which was partially restored by doing surgical procedures. The present renal scan at 8 years shows that the kidney is bulging out due to urine in the collecting system but this becomes normal when there is increased force in the kidney after giving lasix which is a diuretic. Lasix administration is a method to study real and apparent swelling of the renal collecting system. Since the swelling in pelvicalyceal system disappears after taking lasix, it is conclusive that he does not have any real obstruction in the kidney collecting system and the swelling that is apparent on the scan is temporary in nature. It will be good to do blood tests for kidney functions regularly as advised by his doctors to make sure the kidneys are working fine and serum creatinine and blood urea values are in the normal range."},{"Patient":"Hi I m a 24 yr old female and for about 9 years now I ve been waking up during the night and in the morning with severe lower back pains near kidneys and hurts in that area even more when I breath in or cough, at the pain also moves to lower abdomen. when I wake and go to the toilet and walk around it subsides a little bit but at times I am hunched over and can hardly walk in pain, I have had this for nearly 10 years and have tried to ignore it but it s getting worse and won t go away, any suggestions?","Doctor":"HIWell come to HCMI really appreciate your concern as you said that this condition you are facing since long being so this could be due to some functional condition and anxiety and depression may be likely cause, better try to come out this condition, try some exercise, relaxation therapy, try some hot milk, prior to bed these are worth trying instead of taking any medicines, hope this information helps, take care, have a nice day"},{"Patient":"I have a friend that had surgery to remove kidney stones that were too large to pass about a month ago.

Anti diuretic hormone (ADH) produced by posterior pituitary2. Aldosterone ( produced by the adrenal gland situated on top of the kidney)3. Under the influence of Aldosterone which acts on the kidney, water is absorbed along with the sodium ions and this is coupled with secretion of potassium and hydrogen ions into the lumen of the tubules4.

If you are again developing pain while passing urine, that could mean a persistent urinary infection. Sometimes, the microorganism causing the infection is not eradicated with a course of antibiotics. You need to have a urine microscopy test to confirm the infection. If the infection is persisting, you need a urine culture and sensitivity test for exactly finding out the offending organism and to know the appropriate medicines which can cure the infection. An ultrasound of kidneys and bladder is required to know any other underlying pathology which could lead to persistence of the infection.I hope I have answered your query. I can help you better if I can know your age, sex and any co-morbid conditions like diabetes.Wish you a speedy recovery,Best regards,Dr. Raguram GanesamoniMS, MRCS, MCH, F.

Since this has been happening for the last one year therefore there is scarring in the kidneys collection.  This scarring can cause a prominent collecting system which can be the reason for appearance on CT. Usually this can happen even after the infection is treated. Since you have an abdominal pain and fever, therefore it is essential to get urine culture is important.

Is there any remedy for the pain?","Doctor":"Hi,Thanks for writing in to us.Oflocure-oz contains OFLOXACIN and ORNIDAZOLE which are a combination of antibiotics. These antibiotics will treat any infections. Since there is a 6 mm stone in the ureter, it is possible that the stone might go to the lower part of ureter. This can cause obstruction and drinking adequate water might reduce symptoms. Taking Stone syrup will make the urine alkaline. He might have pain at this time which will disappear once the stone reaches the urinary bladder. When this happens the patient might experience severe sharp pain for few days and require pain killers for sometime.Pains can be reduced with pain killers and anti spasmodics.Since creatinine levels are on the higher side, it is important to rule out any obstruction in the passage of urine."},{"Patient":"My  last few tests for Urine Micro albumin were as follows\\" 3-33-1= 14, 5-06-10 = 104 12-06-10 .06 and the on 301011 it was 202, I don't understand why this bounces around so much,.

Overt albuminuria, macroalbuminuria, or proteinuria is defined as a urinary albumin excretion of ≥300 mg/24 h. Patients with type 2 diabetes may have microalbuminuria at presentation, as they may have had latent disease for years. A positive result should be repeated once or twice in the subsequent month and, if it is borderline, a full 24-hour urine collection will give a more definitive result.

There are not enough donor organs to meet this growing need. Stem cell based therapies may offer an alternative solution. The Harvard Stem Cell Institute is developing new therapies to repair kidney damage, reducing the need for dialysis and transplantation.

The treatment depends on the size of the angiomyolipoma. Small asymptomatic lesions (< 4 cm) tend to remain stable but should be periodically evaluated. Medium-sized lesions (4-8 cm) have the most variable behavior. These lesions should be followed closely with serial imaging studies, and if significant changes in size or symptoms are noted, or the patient is at risk for flank trauma, elective intervention should be initiated promptly to increase the chances of renal salvage. Large asymptomatic angiomyolipomas (> 8 cm) will most likely become symptomatic and should be treated electively prior to the development of symptoms and potential complications.Since in your mother the tumor is measuring 6.7 cms, there is time to wait and watch over next 6 months, for any growth in size and urinary symptoms before thinking about surgical treatment."},{"Patient":"hi i am a lab technician and last i got pricked by a needle which has been used for drawing blood from patient, after that i ask the nurse about the history of the patient but she told me that the patient is suffering from kidney disease. after 1months i got headache, common cold and stomach problem, this is killing me every second because i'm scare if it might be a symptoms of hiv","Doctor":"Hi,Thanks for writing in.Kidney disease can be due to many causes and you should have been prompt at following up with the patient soon after having the prick.

Good news is that I have no more pain urinating!","Doctor":"Hi,Thanks for writing in.The stone while passing through the urinary tract might cause injury to the lining cells and this can result in pain and nausea persisting after the stone is removed.It can also be that some of the stones might have been too small on earlier scans and have increased in size during last two years. This can cause acute pain since the last two days. It is possible that the pains vary in intensity and severity depending on location and size. Drinking lots of water an fluids can flush tiny stones out of your system."},{"Patient":"I have 4.9mm stone in interpolar right kidney. no hydronephrosisWhat are my treatment options? I had a stone episode 14 months ago and a 6mm stone was removed using ureteroscopy and stent last year from left kidney distal ureter.  The stone is a calcium oxalate stone.","Doctor":"Hi,Thanks for writing in to us.As long the stone is in the kidney there is no problem as it is a small stone. It is possible that the stone might enter the ureter (tube connecting kidney and urinary bladder) and when in the lower part of ureter and at that time it might cause obstruction to flow of urine. You might have pain at this time which will disappear once the stone reaches the urinary bladder. When this happens you might experience severe sharp pain for few days and require pain killers for sometime. Please continue drinking lots of water at that time.Stenting and ureteroscopy is not required unless the stone grows in size and causes obstruction to flow of urine."},{"Patient":"Dear Sir My ultrasonography report says that both kidneys shows mild increase in the renal cortical echopattern and Diffused fatty changes noted in liver.","Doctor":"Hello Mild increase in renal echotexture may be due to infection,renal parenchymal disease.It need clinical correlation and investigations.Investigations include routine hemogram,RBS,urine RE/ME,renal function test.You are right prescribed antibiotics.If condition deteriorate then you need hospitalization.Diffuse fatty changes in liver is a reversible stage.You should increase your physical activity and avoid fried and fatty food.Liver function  test should be done.You may need few medicines after full investigations.Take care Dr.Indu Bhushan"},{"Patient":"i m 40 year old my both kidney get srink(small in size) since 1999. at present my s.creatinine is 4.0,blood urea is 114 and HB% is 6.9. i fill very tired and wikness. presently itake allopathy medicine like calcium tab,B.P tab amlodipine 10 mg.folic acid and iron tab. but can't relife.

If hemoglobin is 6.9 then you have severe anemia and it needs to be corrected. Blood urea 114 and serum creatinine 4.0 also needs attention. It is important to consult a nephrologist and then proceed with management. The kidney shrinking since 1999 needs to be followed up with an ultrasound scan. Dialysis is a procedure by which the blood creatinine level can be brought down in an emergency. The nephrologist might also request a kidney biopsy to know the exact cause of kidney disease in your case. If you have high blood pressure or diabetes then that must also be controlled with medications. Fluid input and out put along with proteinuria also should be measured. Depending on serum creatinine levels, dialysis is usually repeated till the levels are maintained."},{"Patient":"Hi Goods Afteroon,I Nilam, Living in Tanzania.

The symptoms can include all of those associated with both emptying and storage problems, and can also lead to kidney damage. Bladder storage dysfunction is a symptom of overactive bladder. This can cause your bladder muscles to contract more frequently with urges to urinate. There can also be an emptying dysfunction when the bladder does not empty completely. It’s possible to have both emptying and storage dysfunctions if you have multiple sclerosis.I suggest you get an ultrasound scan for your kidneys and bladder to know if there is any overfilling or obstruction in bladder."},{"Patient":"Hi doc, my friend is 38 years old male and quite obese (over 95Kgs).

These are thin walled fluid containing balloon like structures. After age of 50 years one or two cysts are expected and taken as normal. If the size is more than 3 cms then it is best to get review ultrasound scan after 3 months to 6 months. There is an international classification of kidney cysts and any cyst above 3 cms might have a rare possibility of being dangerous.

Subsequently with drinking lots of water, the stone at renal pelvis has been flushed into the ureter. As it wen downwards, the stone got caught in the vesicoureteric junction. Even in this location the stone can cause significant pain and discomfort. There can also be proximal hydroureteronephrosis. On drinking adequate water this stone will be expelled in to the urinary bladder lumen and make its way out through the penile urethra.A cyst measuring 23 mm in diameter is not significant and can be left alone. Only cysts more than 30 mm in diameter are screened for increase in size by repeat ultrasound scan after 3 to 6 months."},{"Patient":"hi my mother is 52 years old and her ultrasound result is her right kidney has a smaller size than the left and the finding in the right kidney is increase cortical ecogenicity and possibility of right renal artery estenosis.what was that mean? thanks a lot","Doctor":"Hi,Thanks for writing in.A smaller right kidney with increase in cortical echogenicity can indicate decreased kidney function. FOr this the serum creatinine must be measured and glomerular filtration rate is also assessed. Disease in the right kidney might be in the initial stages.The most common cause of renal artery stenosis is a blockage in the arteries due to high cholesterol. This problem occurs when a sticky, fatty substance called plaque builds up on the inner lining of the arteries.When the arteries that carry blood to your kidneys become narrow, less blood flows to the kidneys. The kidneys mistakenly respond as if your blood pressure is low. As a result, they release hormones that tell the body to hold on to more salt and water. This causes your blood pressure to rise."},{"Patient":"Sir I am Deepali patwa I am 33 year old leady and my problem is - My right side kidney is small then left kidney , my right side kidney size is 9.1 x 3.1 , and S Cretinine is 1.66 My urine culture report is as- urine culture report source urine status final pus cells 0- 1 epithelial cells 4 - 6 culture no growth after 48 hr of aerobic incubation adequacy of sample adequate please advise me","Doctor":"Hi,Thanks for writing in.A right kidney size of 91 x 31 mm is acceptable. A normal kidney should be measuring more than 80 mm in length and your right kidney measurement is above normal. The left kidney is usually larger in measurement than right one in everyone. The difference in size of both kidney should be within 2 cms. Please do not worry about size of your kidneys.Coming to your serum creatinine report a value of 1.66 is in the upper limits of normal as per some laboratories. Please check with your laboratory for reference range and after discussing with your doctor, you can get it repeated at a standardised laboratory and compare serum creatinine levels.The urine culture test is normal and you do not have any bacterial infections. You do not need any medications for that."},{"Patient":"My friend had a an attack while working, heart rate increased to 180/min, (atrial fib).

Did He have a heart attack? this was 5 years ago, He is now doing well on medications, EF has increased from 20% to 47% .","Doctor":"It's hard to say whether or not he truly had a heart attack. Cardiomyopathy is a general term that can refer to many disease processes that weaken the contracting function of the heart (which can be measured by the ejection fraction). It can certainly be caused by a heart attack. The diagnosis of a heart attack can be made with either an electrocardiogram (ECG) or cardiac enzymes (blood tests). He can request this information from the hospital where he was treated. The improvement in EF is a good thing, it means that the pumping function of his heart has improved significantly, almost to a normal level.I hope this answers your question."},{"Patient":"Is it necessary to see a GI doctor for a 1) mild hepatomegaly and focal fatty sparring seen in the right lobe and the portal hepatitis region with no focal solid lesion. And 2) right renal parapelvic simple cyst. it doesn t sound serious enough. Is it necessary to see a GI doctor?","Doctor":"Hi,Thanks for writing in.1. Mild hepatomegaly on ultrasound indicates that the size of your liver is more than 14.5 cms. The focal fatty sparing is not a concern. It is important to know why the liver is enlarged in size for you. This can be known after consulting a GI doctor if available. Even a general medicine specialist can be consulted. Your doctor might ask for certain liver function tests and enzyme levels.The common liver enzymes are the following.Aspartate aminotransferase (AST)Alanine aminotransferase (ALT)Alkaline phosphataseGamma glutamyl transpeptidasetests like serum bilirubin direct and total will also have to be done depending on symptoms.2. Right renal parapelvic simple cyst is not a concern if less than 3 cms in size.

Treatment of posttransplantation TMA relies on removal of any precipitating factors, relief of symptoms, and PE or plasma infusion. Therapeutic options for posttransplant TMA, including plasma therapy and targeted complement inhibitors can be used to treat those suffering from TMA. With latest guidelines, there have been patients with TMA who were completely treated at the end of one year with hospitalization and maintenance immune suppression.

Ultrasound showed mild bilateral pelviectasis without frank hydronephrosis. The right kidney measures 10.1CM renal pelvis measures 8mm. The left kidney measures 10.5CM renal pelvis is mildly prominent measuring 10mm. Three subcentimeter cysts are present, two of which are parapelvic in location. Is this the cause of UTI s?","Doctor":"Hi,Thanks for writing in to us.The kidneys as mentioned above are normal in size. The renal pelvis is the area where the upper end of ureter, tube connecting kidney and urinary bladder starts. In the absence of stones or any infection of kidneys it is unlikely that the prominent renal pelvis is a matter of concern. It is mildly prominent and clearly mentioned no hyronephrosis. It is still possible that an infection can move from urinary bladder to kidneys and cause prominence of the kidney pelvis on both sides. This can be confirmed only if there is significant bacterial growth in your urine and if the bladder is also showing signs of infection and cystitis on ultrasound scan. The cysts are very small and will not cause any problems in your case."},{"Patient":"Hi, my daughter was diagnosed with a non specific cortical cyst in her left kidney, upper pole when she was 6yrs old, she is now 15 yrs old and yearly US was done to monitor the kidney. In 2011 both kidneys were found with cysts, and last yr s result showed smaller cysts on the left. We just had our result for this yr and it showed only 1 cyst on the left upper pole , and new mild right sided pelviectasis decreased post void. Question: Is it normal for the smaller cysts to resolve over the yrs? Cyst size is 1.3 cm. Thank you. Would appreciate your response. -","Doctor":"Hi,Thanks for writing in.Cysts in kidney are to be monitored in children. This is to consider any condition associated with multiple cysts which may require early intervention and treatment. Small cysts which are less than a centimeter in diameter can resolve over years. The larger ones do not resolve usually. Since your daughter has cysts in both kidneys earlier, it is important to follow up regularly keeping in mind conditions which can cause multiple kidney cysts in early adult years. A single cyst 1.3 cm in diameter and pelviectasis on left side which decreased on post void is not a concern. Knowing if any family member on either parents side is important. This is because few conditions causing multiple cysts in both kidneys is transmitted through genetic inheritance."},{"Patient":"what is the reason for simple cortical cysts in kidneys? what is the reason for blood in the urine once in a while? what is the reason for increased residual urine? what is the reason for bubbles in the urine? what is the reason for prostatomegaly? Would you please kindly give an answer?","Doctor":"Hi,Thanks for writing in.It's not clear what causes simple kidney cysts. One theory suggests that kidney cysts develop when the surface layer of the kidney weakens and forms a pouch (diverticulum). The pouch then fills with fluid, detaches and develops into a cyst. This is common after age of 60 years and two cysts in each kidney are acceptable as normal variation at that age.Blood in urine once in a while should be investigated in detail by doing ultrasound scan and urine tests for presence of blood. This can be due to problems in kidney, urinary bladder, prostate and urethra. To know exactly where the blood is coming from requires detailed clinical examination and investigations.Bubbles in urine are a routine occurrence and usually normal in the first urine of the day. If there is too many bubbles in urine then doing urine protein estimation might be required.Benign prostatic hypertrophy (BPH) is an extremely common condition in elderly men and is a major cause of outflow obstruction. It happens due to hormonal changes with advanced age and the prostate gland which is located at base of urinary bladder gets enlarged in size causing difficulty in passing urine."},{"Patient":"I was just diagnosed with moderate to severe right-sided hydronephrosis and hydroureter, with the point of obstruction at the junction of the mid distal third ureter. What does this all mean? They said there is no definite mass seen, and no definite adenopathy. I m having a ureteroscopy with possible biopsy done this week. I m nervous and confused... I do have a 3mm stone up in the same kidney.","Doctor":"Hi,Thanks for writing in.The collecting system of the kidney is made of renal calyces and pelvis. This collects the urine formed in kidney and transports it tthrough the ureter (tubes connecting kidneys and urinary bladder) to the urinary bladder. Hydronephrosis means that there is swelling of the collecting system of kidney which icludes the calyces and pelvis of kidney. Hydroureter is a term applied to increase in diameter of the ureter which carries urine from the kidneys to urinary bladder.Since you have a 3 mm stone in the kidney, it is possible that the stone is now in the lower part of ureter and is causing obstruction to flow of urine. This is causing the hydronephrosis and hydroureter in you and please drink adequate water to allow the stone to come out of the lower ureter and into the urinary bladder. You might have pain at this time which will disappear once the stone reaches the urinary bladder."},{"Patient":"I have a history of kidney stones. Almost 2 years back, I had the last of 3 lithotrispy to remove stones. Since last 2 days, I am having mild pain on the left side. It s not severe pain that is usually associated with kidney stones, however it s still uncomfortable. Are there other treatment options than lithotrispy?","Doctor":"Hi,Thanks for writing in.Since you have had 3 lithotripsy sessions 3 years back, it is important to consider possibility of multiple kidney stones in you. Some of the stones might have been too small on earlier scans and have increased in size during last two years. This can cause acute pain since the last two days. It is possible that the pains vary in intensity and severity depending on location and size. Drinking lots of water an fluids can flush tiny stones out of your system. Getting an ultrasound scan or CT scan KUB region is most important for you right now to know the exact cause of pain and if there is any urinary obstruction in kidneys."},{"Patient":"yes. just got my path back on my left adrenal gland .....adrenalectomy and they said it a adrenal cortical adenoma.....having a time finding info on this....they said that the tumor was producting to much stelroids and now my right one is not working and I am now taking stelroids by mouth....what symtoms would i have with the tumor producing to much stelroids","Doctor":"Hi,Thanks for writing in.Adrenal adenoma is a benign tumor of adrenal gland which is located above the kidneys. Most benign adrenal tumors cause no symptoms and don't require treatment. But sometimes benign adrenal tumors can secrete high levels of certain hormones that can cause complications. In these cases, treatment for benign adrenal tumors may include surgery or medications.Symptoms caused by adrenal adenomas due to excess steroid production is called Cushings syndrome and includes the following(i) Weight gain and fatty tissue deposits, particularly around the midsection and upper back, in the face (moon face), and between the shoulders (buffalo hump)(ii) Pink or purple stretch marks (striae) on the skin of the abdomen, thighs, breasts and arms(iii) Thinning, fragile skin that bruises easily(iv) Slow healing of cuts, insect bites and infections(v) Acne"},{"Patient":"I was diagnosed with kidney stones last year and today i am suffering pains from lower back, groin and sides on my belly.

If there is any problem with prostate and urethra like a stricture then that must be treated first.It is important to get imaging investigations like ultrasound scan and CT scan of the abdomen to know the origin of hematuria.

Will I just get really sick before it passes? How do I know it is ready to pass","Doctor":"Hi,Thanks for writing in.You might be having a stone at the vesico ureteric junction or VUJ. This is where the ureter just enters the urinary bladder and is a frequent site of obstruction. Alpha blocker medications are best suited for a stone in the VUJ. These medications inhibit the muscle tone and enhance ureteric contraction in the ureter. As a result the stone is pushed forwards and is exited in to the lumen of urinary bladder. When this happens you might experience severe sharp pain for few days and require pain killers for sometime. Please continue drinking lots of water at that time. Since you also have UTI it is important to take a course of antibiotics after urine culture and sensitivity testing."},{"Patient":"Went over top of handle bars on mountain bike and climbing bar jabbed into my right kidney.

Is it a bruised kidney or could it be something else?","Doctor":"Hi,Thanks for writing in.There is a possibility of grade I kidney trauma and that might be reason for small traces of blood in your urine. The pain during coughing and sneezing is probably associated with soft tissue injury to the abdominal wall muscles not related to kidney injury.Since you have grade I kidney injury due to blunt trauma, the treatment is conservative and will improve with rest and medications. If CT scan has been done then any other serious condition is ruled out. Since the injury is recent, healing will take time and it is suggested that you do not stress yourself physically and take rest from mountain biking and other physical activities for about 15 days. You might get repeat blood test done to know if there is microscopic bleeding in the urinary tract. If present then a discussion with your urologist is required."},{"Patient":"Was diagnosed with kidney stones by ER and 3 cat scans. Very painful lower abdomen and lower back.

Phleboliths are benign findings and requires no treatment. This is confirmed by CT scans and does not have anything to do with bowel and urination. It is not something you should worry about. They are are literally vein calcium depositions, and represent calcification within venous structures. They are particularly common in the pelvis though can be seen anywhere in the body. This is a very common condition in the elderly when almost half of normal people have it.

I suppose you have got X rays done which indicate injury to vertebrae L 4 and L 5 levels at lower back. This can cause severe pain in the region and is not related to your kidneys in any way. You probably need a MRI scan of your lower back spine to know if there is injury to the bones and discs. This can cause pinching of nerves and pain is experienced along the area supplied by the nerves. Rest and avoiding heavy physical activities is important and this will heal your injuries quickly. There might also be muscle spasm in the lower back which might be treated with an ointment containing a pain killer and muscle relaxant applied gently about twice a day.

You must drink adequate amounts of water and fluids and not hold urine for long durations. You can get a urine culture and sensitivity test done and then take long duration of course of antibiotics medications which will work for the infection. For the kidney complications, it is better to do kidney function tests like serum creatinine and glomerular filtration rate to know if there is chronic kidney disease and its stage.

The two uterus is dues to duplication of some cells in embryonic stage. It is to be known what type of kidney problems she is facing and if there is duplication or any structural abnormalities. If such a condition exists then probably the uterus and kidney abnormalities are related by origin but not by function.

The creatinine is a toxic product which is constantly washed out of the body by kidneys. There are also urine creatinine levels measured and this is done only when the serum creatinine is high. Essentially having low serum creatinine means that your kidneys are functioning well and you do not have toxic matter accumulating in your system.

I am Dean Davies, Australian male , living in China. 60 years old, still overweight but trying. February 2009, I went to a doctor here in China for a general check-up, to discover that at some recent time, I had had a heart attack. I had no symptoms and it came as a huge surprise. Following this, a series of tests, angiogram, CT scans etc etc, I had a tripple heart by-pass surgery in China. (2 years ago). later in 2009 I developed an upper stomach hernia, requiring surgery which I had in February 2010. (this has now re-occurred BUT I have not yet decided what to do about it). Two weeks ago, I had a difficult night of upper body and limb discomfort. At first I thought it was heart, then convinced myself after taking paracetamol and rest, that it was probably a fever since  had some fever the following day. A couple of days later I felt OK. During the last few days, I have lost all energy.  I go out to walk, and after only a few steps, I am completely exhausted and can go no further. I have no pain, but cannot breath, and feel completely stuffed. I return home to bed. I am coughing a lot. This itself makes me feel exhausted of course, but later, when no coughing, I feel good, go outside to walk, and simply cannot walk due to breathing difficulty. I feel it is my heart, but dont know what to do about it. Here are the reasons why.......... I have no medical Insurance here. I have little money since being cheated out of most of my money by the people I initially (4 years ago), came to work for as a Senior Retirement Village Consultant. I cant go back to Australia, because I have a Chinese wife and will lose the only job I now have, teaching English at a University. If I go to a doctor in China, their system in GO INTO HOSPITAL no matter needed or not, THEN they pump you with inexpensive drugs which they charge extortionate prices for, and try to keep you in the hospital as long as possible doing this. It is now Chinese New Year. Where I am, there are very limited doctors who can speak English, and even if they can they still use the INTO hospital solution for everything. It's a revolving door effect I have and I cant get out. I take Captopril Blood pressure tablets daily - 3 x 25 mg. I tested my BP today, and it is under control at 120/90. I seek help and advice. Can you suggest some medication I can get (generic names) which i can buy from the medicine shops here (many foreign drugs are availabe and no prescripton is needed, just off the shelf buying). If I can get suggested drug names, I can translate into Chinese and go shopping. I can get the same drugs they give in Hospital, for 10 to 20 times less cost from the medicine shops. After a successful 30 years employment as CEO of Hopitals and Retirement Villages and ambulance services in Australia I am stuck here in China, almost broke and now with this problem. I guess that's life, but I am hoping to continue life and health.

Conjugated hyperbilirubinemia can occur as a result of either intrahepatic or extrahepatic disorders. Markedly abnormal aminotransferases and LDH in conjunction with a normal abdominal ultrasound scan suggest ischemic liver injury which can be due to any operative complications like drugs and medications. As ultrasound scan shows no significant findings, please allow the doctors to deal with it slowly and get liver function tests repeated when required."},{"Patient":"Hi i've been on my birth control pill almost for a year, iam sex active but we also use condoms, few weeks ago I had a kidney infection and I was taking very strong antibiotics, i also took my pills like 12 hours later than i should or even more for about 4 or 5days(didnt have sex tough ,its not pregnancy for sure) so now after I finished my antibiotics i noticed a brown spotting it now lasts about for a week,while on my birth control pill And when I finish the packet I get my period about on the 3rd day,today its the 4th -still no period showing and brown spotting is still occuring.

It is mainly due to stress associated with urinary and kidney infection which is causing the spotting. Please do not worry if it is for few days. Any heavy long duration flow must be discussed with your doctors. Any infection is a stressful event and can cause imbalance in female hormones. This further can cause mild spotting or inter cycle vaginal bleeding. This spotting or bleeding is usually less than normal bleeding occurring during cycles.

The presence of calcification needs to be evaluated with the confirmation of whether it is fluid containing cyst or a fat containing tumor. Fat containing renal tumours are usually benign and considered as angiomyolipomas on imaging modalities. Some cases of renal cell carcinoma have been reported. Since the size is small and without knowing about the fat or fluid content, it is difficult to specifically confirm the diagnosis. It is best to get a review ultrasound scan after 3 months to monitor any increase in size. If it grows faster then it needs a biopsy confirmation of diagnosis.It is not related to your frequent UTIs in childhood."},{"Patient":"My 60 year old brother had a heart attack on Jul 29th.

One of the tests she will have before a transplant is HLA typing, also called tissue typing. This test identifies certain proteins in the blood called antigens. Antigens are markers on the cells in your body, which help your body, tell the difference between self and non-self.

The CT scan images are to be seen to discuss in detail. Rarely, such a pain can also be caused by another problem in the same area. The presence of the stone causing any obstruction is the most definite  sign of pain due to the kidney stone.

The most common infection involving Proteus mirabilis occurs when the bacteria moves to the urethra and urinary bladder and that might have happened with you. Urinary tract infections caused by Proteus mirabilis occur usually in patients under long-term catherization. The bacteria have been found to move and create encrustations on the urinary catheters. The encrustations cause the catheter to block and the bacteria multiply and colonize.Any catheterization during the hospital stay can be the cause of the infection. Rarely such a proteus mirabilis infection might occur even without catheterization."},{"Patient":"I saw a specialist about my kidneys after my GFR came back low after routine blood work.

Bilateral renal parenchymal disease means that the renal impairments are in the medullar and cortical areas affecting both the two kidneys. Thinning of renal parenchyma is a condition in which the cortex is thinned out and this can can be due to many reasons. The possibilities are glomerular diseases and chronic interstitial nephritis.

My pressure damaged my kidney not to the point were I need dialysis just enough to know that it has been harmed.","Doctor":"Hi,Thanks for writing in.High blood pressure is one of the commonest causes of kidney disease and this should be detected early and treated on time. Chronic hypertension leads to kidney damage known as hypertensive nephropathy or hypertensive nephrosclerosis. Presently, this is a condition which is commonly seen in patients of kidney disease and diagnosis should be made promptly to avoid delay in treatment. Initial kidney function tests like blood urea and serum creatinine must be evaluated. If tests results are abnormal then glomerular filtration rate must be done and if that also shows reduced function then a  kidney biopsy might be required. Renal biopsy and pathological examination is the gold standard of diagnosis.If your kidney functions are compromised then your doctor will suggest a biopsy to know the exact nature of kidney disease probably due to hypertension.The best way to control kidney complications arising out of hypertension is to take regular treatment for high blood pressure and have a good diet and fitness plan."},{"Patient":"I have been diagnosed with a kidney disease being alports disease.

Currently he is under the temp cathe and had 1 failed fistula surgery too. Awaiting an earliest reply. Jazakallah khair. June 30, 2011","Doctor":"walaikum wassalam. First of all it is important for you to know the condition of the patient and the diagnosis as patient has a complex of diseases. Patient has hypertension induced Renal failure and hypertension induced heart failure. The reports suggest that patient has advance renal failure and the residual function of kidney is less than 10 %. As you have mentioned that the main problem of the patient is shortness of breath. the causes of shortness of breath are as follow: A) As the patient has an HB of 5.5 which is of course dangerously low. This low haemoglobin is due to non functioning kidneys. Basically the chemical that causes blood formation in the bone marrown is derived from thekidneys. When kidneys lose its function the blood formation reduces significantly which cause Anemia(low Hb). This low HB results in shortness of breath because of the low oxygen carrying capacity of the blood to deliver oxygen to the body tissues. B) Heart failure is another cause of the shortness of breath. Heart functions as a pump that pushes the blood towards the tissue. Decline in heart function leads to Inadequate supply of blood to the tissue which cause shortness of breath and also the blood starts to pool in the peripheral tissues like lungs that also causes shortness of breath. C) Ureamia; patient has a significantly elevated urea and creatinine levels that shows that toxins have not properly eliminated from the body. These toxins in turn virtually disrupt function of every organ of the body. At this particular point of time the most suitable and life saving treatment is of course Haemodialysis. Three times a week is one of the best regimens along side the concomitant treatment for Hypertension and heart failure. Regarding low HB the most suitable treatment would be ESPOGEN( recombinant erythropoietin). This is the chemical that induces blood formation as mentioned earlier on. Patient is already taking it. If economically feasible it would be best if 2000 units be given twice a week subcutaneously. It will have significant impact on both low HB and Shortness of breath. Regarding the catheters it's necessary to know that long term dialysis needs fistula. The dual lumen catheters have a high chance of bacterial infection and are thus used as a temporary bridge to fistula. Formation of fistula to until it works takes up to 2 months. Central venous catheter( used as a bridge to fistula) have two varieties; 1) the first variety are temporary catheters that passed directly to central veins and are thus easy to use but have high rate of infection and less half life. 2) Permanent catheters that are passed into the central veins via a tunnel in the skin. The chances of infection are low and half life is more but these require high skill to pass and are costly. Thus if the patient has already one failed surgery procedure, it's better to use a permanent Catheter(the second variety) and then try for a second fistula surgery and if the surgery gets successful then remove catheter and proceed further with fistula. I hope you find this helpful. regards.Dr.Abdur Rehman Alozai."},{"Patient":"Back pain around waist below ribs for a couple months, had 2 ct scans doctors say don t know why - had kidney infection took med to clear, now clear but still have pain....ct shows had stone but not now...so need to know if I should get 2nd opinion ???","Doctor":"Hi,Thanks for writing in.There are many reasons for a pain in the lower ribs other than a renal stone. The commonest pain I can think of might be associated with your ribs and muscles. I say this keeping in mind that your CT scan is normal and the pain is more in the ribs and anterior chest wall. There are conditions like costochondritis which is an inflammation of the cartilage component of ribs and this does not show any features on CT scan. Apart from costochondritis, there can be muscle spasm causing such a pain.If the pain is from the inside then I will suggest you to get an endoscopy done to look for gastritis features in the stomach.

This is not normal and you must talk to your doctor about it. There are many other pain relief medications which you might take for your pains.Some of the urination associated side effects of Percocet are the followingdecrease in the frequency of urinationdecreased urinationdifficult or painful urinationgreatly decreased frequency of urination or amount of urineincreased urinationAny of the above symptoms while taking Percocet 10 need to be watched for and discussed with your doctor."},{"Patient":"My husband has polycystic kidney disease (the dominant type) I am curious if we could have a child with the recessive type. I know the genetic mutation is on two different genes. So would it be possible for our child to have the recessive type which is more severe or would they only be able to inherit the dominant type?","Doctor":"Hi,Thanks for writing in.Autosomal dominant PKD is the most common inherited disorder of the kidneys. The phrase \\"autosomal dominant\\" means that if one parent has the disease, there is a 50 percent chance that the disease gene will pass to a child.Autosomal recessive PKD is caused by a mutation in the autosomal recessive PKD gene, called PKHD1. Other genes for the disease might exist but have not yet been discovered by scientists. It is not possible for autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease father to have autosomal recessive polycystic child.So your child might have risk of autosomal dominant but never autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease."},{"Patient":"I have been diagonosed having simple renal cortical cyst in both the kidynes and the one on the right kidney is clinically observed to be of 7.8 cms length and I am having no urination problem except more than normal frequency of urination and little pain in my back between ribs and the hip. The Urologist has advised that in case of laproscopic surgery there may be a chance of the cyst again growing and only open surgery can get me rid of this. Further as long as it does not pose any serious problem like severe pain and any other complication there is no immediate need for going in for surgery. I would like to get your advice.","Doctor":"Hi,Thanks for writing in.Renal cortical cysts are common and can be seen in most people above age of 60 years. The cyst measuring 7.8 cm on the right side is a big one but as your doctor has said, it is not a concern if there is no clinical symptoms of pain, urinary retention in the kidney or any development of infections. If you are a male and above 60 years of age then your prostate enlargement can cause symptoms of increased frequency of urination and also please do PSA levels if you are an elderly male.Talking about surgery, I have seen many people with larger cysts than the one you have and without any symptoms. They have been doing well for years without any concern. I suggest you do not think about surgery and continue to get a follow up ultrasound every year. Please discuss the increased frequency of urination with regards to any bladder problems with the urologist."},{"Patient":"Hi Sir, I have stones in my both kidneys. from last two days i have pain in my stomach towards right bottom. So i have gone for ultrasound and in that a tiny cyst in parenchyma measuirng approx 7x3.5 mm is written. Can you please guide what is it and the treatment?","Doctor":"Hi,Thanks for writing in.If you have stones in the kidneys then it is important to treat that. Treatment of kidney stones is usually the following1. Drinking lots of water.2. Treatment with medications called alpha blockers which are given if any stone is stuck in the passage between kidney and urinary bladder.3. Pain killers to reduce any pain due to stones.4. Big stones are broken in to smaller pieces with sound waves (extracorporeal lithotripsy)5. Bigger stones are taken out surgically.The parenchymal cyst is small and will not cause any problems. Please do not worry."},{"Patient":"I have persistant kidney stones, lots of them, I have had 8 ESWL procedures over the past 9 months, at first the stones were passing like 5-6 small ones would be released each time i went pee for for the first 2 weeks after each proceedure. About every 6 weeks I have the stints (bi-laderal) removed and replaced and have the ESWL proceedure. The stones dont seem to be breaking up as well any more and still my KUB shows more replacing the ones that have passed. The stones are in both left & right kidneys and are rather large, without the stints the pain can be unbareable. what can I do.","Doctor":"Hi,Thanks for writing in.Your doctor is giving you the right treatment for kidney stones.Usual treatment for kidney stones is breaking big stones into smaller parts and allowing that to come out through stents. If the stones are large then they have to be taken out by surgical methods. It is best you get a CT scan plain KUB done to know the exact size and number of stones. This will help your doctor to give you the best treatment in this situation. Drinking lots of water and passing urine at regular intervals will also help to flush out small stones. Regarding stents, the decision of your urologist must be accepted and if there is any complication stents can be removed or might require reposition."},{"Patient":"My son is 9y/o and has a history of hydronephrosis. His recent US report states he has small right kidney with mild parenchymal thinning and increased echogencity in the interpolar region but normal renal parenchymal echogenicity. What does this means?","Doctor":"Hi,Thanks for writing in.Let me explain ultrasound findings in simple language.The above findings say that there is a possibility of something like a stone in the mid part of right kidney. The fact that it is a stone is not completely confirmed. This is leading to obstruction to the urinary flow from kidney down to the urinary bladder. Hydronephrosis is swelling of the kidney due to urinary obstruction. The parenchymal thinning is probably due to the pressure effects of urine obstruction.I suggest that a X ray of kidneys and urinary bladder is done and the possibility of a stone causing obstruction discussed with the urologist.Please do not ignore as urinary obstruction for more than 10 days can lead to permanent kidney damage."},{"Patient":"Hi Iam having a back pain from a week, So I thought it as a normal pain,from past 3 days I could feel that it is not back pain but actually my kidney is paining a bit.I unable to concentrate on my work because i feel that I am a bit dull , a bit fever and body pains as well, What to do??","Doctor":"Hi,Thanks for writing in to us.It is important that you consult a doctor and get an ultrasound scan done immediately. Fever, pain and discomfort in the kidney area can be due to many conditions including that involving kidneys. Any associated fever is a sign of infection and inflammation and must be treated at the earliest. As you have not mentioned the side, it is difficult to discuss all possibilities but if it is on the right side, a gall bladder or liver problem must also be considered.Please take paracetamol 500 mg every 6 hours after food to control fever and body ache till you consult your doctor.

I am scheduled for partial kidney removal next Tuesday. The surgery will be done robotically. Realistically do I have good odds of getting through this successfully?","Doctor":"Hi,Thanks for writing in.A mass lesion in the kidney of size 4 cm is best removed surgically if it cannot be confirmed to be a cyst. It is least likely to be associated with any trauma to your spleen as mentioned by you. I am sure your doctors have done a CT scan to know more about the mass in the left kidney. There must be some diagnosis made based on CT scan appearance and discussing that might help.Usually a lesion of 3 cm can be left on follow up for some time. As your mass is 4 cm, it is wise to get it removed and send it for histopathological analysis.Please do not worry about a robotic surgery and I am sure you will come through it with minimum discomfort.Wish you a quick recovery."},{"Patient":"Hello Dr, BhuahanI was given antibiotics for a kidney infection on Monday and the doctor said to come back in 3 days if it wasn't getting better.

My second question is..I have pain in my left side in my back around my kidney...burning pain? It comes and goes...it is not continuous.. That was the main reason I had a CT scan done. They said everything looked normal on the CT Scan other than the 3 mm spot on my liver. They cannot understand the pain I have in my left side back. is it my kidney? Thank you.","Doctor":"Hi,Thanks for writing in.In my opinion a 3 mm spot in your liver need not be a concern right now. A 3 mm spot is too small to characterize by CT scan and this needs to be followed up probably in 6 months or a year. A description of the liver spot might not be accurate enough to label it as a concern.During CT scan abdomen, the kidneys are assessed and I do not think there is any problem with your kidneys which can be causing the left back pain. If the abdominal organs are normal then focus should be on the bones and muscles at the back.Another cause of burning pain not visualized on CT scan abdomen is gastritis. This pain usually intensifies after long hours of fasting and following intake of spicy foods. You might discuss this with your doctor."},{"Patient":"Hi sir i am worrying i am only 21 yrs old female i had always experiencing low potassium 2.0 i admit in the hospital 3 times this year because of low potassium and at the same time my creatinine range in 94.70 which is high the doctor said.

Thank you so much","Doctor":"Hi,Thanks for writing in.Low potassium or hypokalemia, especially if persistent, can induce a variety of changes in renal function, impairing tubular transport and possibly inducing chronic tubulointerstitial disease and cyst formation.Diet modification is recommended for you. High sodium intake tends to enhance renal potassium losses. Therefore, taking a low-sodium, high-potassium diet is best for you. Avoid extra salt in foods. Bananas, tomatoes, oranges, and peaches are high in potassium and can be included in your diet."},{"Patient":"i have a 1.7 centimeter adrenal adenoma on my left kidney plus a 9.5 centimeter cyst on same kidney. i also sometimes have urine leakage not making it in time to the bathroom. would this be connected to this problem and should you always have the adrenal gland of this size out regardless if benign or not? thank you.","Doctor":"Hi,Thanks for writing in.An adrenal adenoma is separate from the kidney. In location it is above the kidney. The adrenal glands are small in size and they cannot occur in the kidney. The adrenal adenoma requires no attention if your do not have any abnormal adrenal conditions.A cyst in the left kidney measuring 9.5 cms in diameter should be investigated in detail and followed by by ultrasound at 3 to 6 month intervals. Any cyst more than 3 cms in diameter must be seen every 6 months especially if there is pain in the area of the cyst.The cysts are fluid filled and are not connected to urine symptoms like urgency unless there is an infection in your kidneys.If your CT scan does not show any signs of kidney infection then urinary leakage is not due to the cyst."},{"Patient":"I am told that I have protein in my blood and high levels of creatine in my blood.

Only if there is reduced renal function should there be potassium restriction. The syrup that you have mentioned is fairly safe and can be used on a long term basis with periodic monitoring yo ensure you have no increase on kidney stones or urine infection.Oxalobact is fairly safe but whether it is effective is still bring debated.

She is 30 years old never any problems with her kidneys in the past. What could be causing this. They have placed her in the hospital and given her a CT. We have just been told that her kidneys are not functioning properly. Why?","Doctor":"Hi,There can be many reasons for urine retention in a your daughter.Mechanical/anatomical causes include urethral stenosis, foreign objects, bladder stones, constipation, urethral cancer, uterine fibroids, bladder-neck obstruction, pelvic organ prolapse, cervical cancer and anti-incontinence surgery.Functional or neurological causes of urinary retention in women include cerebral and spinal cord diseases which can be congenital, neoplastic, degenerative, inflammatory, vascular or traumatic, e.g. spinal cord injury (suprasacral), multiple sclerosis, Parkinson’s disease, cauda equina syndrome and Fowler’s syndrome.It is important to know what is the diagnosis made on CT scan stating that the kidneys are not functioning properly.The problems with the kidneys might have arisen due to obstruction in the flow of urine from the urinary bladder to the exterior. If there is persistent obstruction to the flow of urine then there are back pressure changes from the urinary bladder in to the kidneys. If such an obstruction continues for more than 10 days then permanent damage to kidney function is possible and this is called obstructive uropathy."},{"Patient":"Hi Dr,I have a kidney stone  5mm in lower ureter .Dr has suggested to use tamlocept 0.2mg ( tamsulosin hyderochloride ) .

It is important that you drink lots of water and fluids to cause the flushing effect on the stone which is stuck in the lower or distal end of the ureter.Watchful waiting with concomitant medication (i.e., analgetics, anti inflammatory agents, alpha-blockers) is considered an option for smaller stones (Review of medical literature says that the time to spontaneous passage also depends on stone size and location. In one study the mean passage time was between 5 days (for smaller distal stones) to 6 weeks and treating with medications for this duration may be reasonable for smaller distal stones as you have, if you do not have any symptoms."},{"Patient":"4.     Mr. Grimaldi was previously diagnosed as having a posterior pituitary tumor that causes hypersecretion of ADH.

A living donor kidney functions, on average, 12 to 20 years, and a deceased donor kidney from 8 to 12 years.Research shows that patients who get a kidney transplant before dialysis live an average of 10 to 15 years longer than if they stayed on dialysis. Younger adults benefit the most from a kidney transplant, but even adults as old as 75 gain an average of four more years after a transplant than if they had stayed on dialysis.If you get another live kidney and if you are approaching middle age then you might be lucky to live up to 75 years of age or more."},{"Patient":"I have has just had two kidney function tests the first was 1.1 the second was 1.06 I have been told that any resualt above 1.0 means that the kidney fuction is reduced My doctor does not seem concerned though I do have a 2.5mm kidney stone in my kidney that is not blocking any thing at the moment.","Doctor":"Hi,I think you are asking about serum creatinine tests. A serum creatinine test measures the level of creatinine in your blood and gives you an estimate of how well your kidneys. The normal range for creatinine in the blood may be 0.6 to 1.3 milligrams per deciliter mg/ dl and various laboratories may slightly differ on their reference values. If your values at 1.1 and 1.06 then there is no need to worry. A 2.5 mm stone will not do any harm to your kidney or cause obstruction severe enough to raise serum creatinine levels.Since there is no reason to worry about a creatinine of 1.1 mg/ dl therefore your doctor is not concerned about it. For peace of mind you can get serum creatinine test done after 3 months from a different place and then discuss the results if it is different.

A horseshoe kidney is a congenital fusion of two developed kidneys which are connected to each other at the lower part. It forms a U shape which is similar to that of a horseshoe and therefore the name. If your have never had any complication due to horseshoe kidneys then it is unlikely that the growing baby in the uterus will be affected by the horseshoe and neither will your kidney functions be compromised in any way due to presence of horse shoe kidneys.However, if you have had any serious kidney function decline earlier then pregnancy may cause some risks and needs to be monitored with care. The strain of pregnancy on body along with serious kidney damage might cause pregnancy complications like premature delivery, eclampsia, stillbirth.This is because the kidneys have to work more to filter wastes produced by both mother and fetus, which will certainly cause further damage to your kidneys.Should there be such a concern the you should get regular ultrasound scans of kidneys and kidney functions repeated at regular intervals and discuss the results with the doctor."},{"Patient":"WHAT IS THE MEDICATION GIVEN BY MY DOCTOR FOR CALLED LOSARTAN BY MY PHYSICIAN FOR.

According to the Act, the unrelated donor has to file an affidavit in the court of a magistrate stating that the organ is being donated out of affection. After which the donor has to undergo number of tests before the actual transplant takes place.

In the past, treatment for painful obstructing main pancreatic duct stones was a surgical lateral pancreaticojejunostomy and open duct stone removal.In recent times and over the last 25 years, endoscopic techniques to remove main pancreatic duct stones have been developed using methods similar to ones applied in bile duct stone removal. Simple stones can be extracted using various endoscopic techniques such as balloon or basket techniques. Larger and impacted stones typically require lithotripsy or surgery.Medications do not help much in the treatment of pancreatic duct stones. Oral pancreatic enzyme supplements, a low fat diet, and analgesics are standard management for patients with chronic pancreatitis with or without duct stones. These therapies do not affect stone size or stone formation.There are many good hospitals in India offering treatment and this is treated by gastroenterology surgeons.

We are now only giving her water but I am afraid to take her to the doctor because I believe they will casterize her or give her an antibiotic through an IV. Please tell me what I can do and what they will do in the doctors office for her!? Thanks","Doctor":"Hi,Please do not neglect kidney infection in your daughter. You must consult a pediatrician and urologist and get her treated immediately.Do not be afraid of catheterisation or IV medications. If you do not take her to doctor on time then kidneys can get permanently damaged and can also be a threat to her life involving complications like kidney abscess or sepsis.A kidney abscess is a rare but serious complication of a kidney infection. It's when pus develops inside the tissue of the kidney. This can happen if the kidney infection is not treated. Making her drink water will not prevent an abscess from forming if she is having the infection. Kidney abscesses are potentially serious because the bacteria inside the abscess can spread to other parts of the body, such as her bloodstream or lungs, and can be fatal.Sepsis is another rare, but potentially fatal, complication of kidney infection. It happens when bacteria spreads from the kidneys into the bloodstream. Once bacteria are in your blood, the infection can spread to any part of her body, including all of the major organs."},{"Patient":"I AM 46. Height 5.3.Weight 63kg.

Actually losakind tab can raise serum Creat temporarily. So my advice is ask your doctor whether he can stop it gradually. You just repeat your S. Creat every monthly and see how is the improvement. If creatinine is decreasing then don't restart losakind tablet. The interesting fact is that same medicine is drug of choice in already established kidney damage. So if report is not improving after stoppage of the medicine then restart losakind. Avoid any kind of pain killers. Drink plenty of waters. There are medicines which can prevent further kidney damage. Ask your doctor about them. Thank you.

Regards, Satya","Doctor":"Hi,Chronic kidney disease affects most people with diabetes in those having the condition for more than 10 - 15 years. The early stages cause an elevated glomerular filtration rate with enlarged kidneys, but the principal feature of diabetic nephropathy is proteinuria. This develops insidiously, starting as intermittent microalbuminuria before progressing to constant proteinuria and occasionally nephrotic syndrome. Diabetes also affects the nerves and eyes. Presence of high blood pressure also worsens the disease progress.Your mother should follow strict blood sugar level control. Doing HbA1c test will give a better evaluation of the control. Dietary changes need to be made and a renal diet needs to be followed. COnsultation with a diabetologist and nephrologist (kidney specialist) is important with regular monitoring of creatinine levels and urinary excretion of proteins."},{"Patient":"hi my father is on dialysis and doctors suggested him a transplant.. i wish to donate a kidney to him so i had my tests but my cholestrol level is high and my father is a diabetic patient as well .. i would like to know that can i still be a donor or no?","Doctor":"Hi,There are guidelines for live kidney donors to be followed for a successful transplantation to keep the chances of rejection minimum. For those donors with high cholesterol, it iz said that various forms of dyslipidemia have been associated with decreased kidney function in the general population and with faster rates of progression in those patients who have chronic renal disease.High cholesterol levels or dyslipidemia should be included along with other risk factors in donor risk assessment, but dyslipidemia alone does not exclude kidney donation.You can still donate a kidney to your father after getting a detailed evaluation done by a the group of doctors in the transplantation team."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor my son was suffering with nephrotic syndrom from last two years.he dignosis on 1 1/2 yr now he is 3+ yrs this 3rd time repitition.we are using steriods for him pleasa give me adivce like what can i do for not repet of nephrotic problem for my son again thanking you","Doctor":"Hi,Most children will have at least one relapse or recurrence of protein in the urine. Each relapse will need a further course of steroid treatment. In general, steroid treatment for a relapse is for a shorter time than the initial treatment at the time of diagnosis of nephrotic syndrome. If a child has fairly frequent relapses then they might take a small dose of steroid medication on alternate days to prevent relapses. This is usually called maintenance treatment. However, as the child becomes older, the relapses usually happen less often.It is important to remember that children with the usual type of nephrotic syndrome (minimal change disease) have no risk of kidney failure. Usually, as a child grows older, the nephrotic syndrome will become less troublesome. The great majority of children will eventually grow in to normal adults."},{"Patient":"does the combination of black elderberry, ginger root, echinacea root, andrographis paniculate leaf, raise ones heart rate?

When a stent is kept for a period of time, complications including migration, fragmentation, and encrustation and this can cause bleeding along with the fact that you are on treatment for TIA  with coumadin.

The PSA level is increased in cases of infection and cancer. If you always had a higher PSA when done earlier then there is less chance of cancer but if the PSA level increased by a considerable value since the last time it was done then you need to get cystoscopy, ultrasound and guided biopsy done to rule out cancer.

As you have mentioned about the urinary tract infection, there is a possibility of the urinary infection climbing up the tube connecting the urinary bladder and kidney (ureter) and causing spread of infection to the kidneys.

Then there are options of getting a kidney form a close relative or having to wait  as per the serial number and availability of a kidney in the waiting transplant register. For a donor within the family. the donor is screened and must be found fit for donation. If yes then after doing blood and tissue matching and imaging studies, the transplantation surgery is conducted by the transplantation teams. After transplantation, the recipient has to stay for a while and the transplant acceptance or rejection is looked for after surgery.For kidney from unknown donor, there is always a long waiting list.

A dull pain in the kidney area needs to be investigated further. This can be better visualised by doing an ultrasound scan of abdomen. There are many organs other than kidneys which can be associated with a dull pain.

Creatinine levels must be evaluated in detail and treated at the earliest to avoid complications and potential danger to kidney functions. If your creatinine levels are higher than normal, it may suggest that your kidneys are not filtering the blood as effectively as they should. However, over time, glomerular function rate (kidney filtration rate) can fluctuate, so one abnormal test result does not automatically mean that you have chronic kidney disease. A diagnosis of chronic kidney disease is usually only confirmed if repeated glomerular function rate tests show that your glomerular function rate is consistently lower than normal over the space of three months."},{"Patient":"Hi my father aged 66 years when checked for s.creatanine last month it was high as 7.

Will you be able to help me?Regards,Dattatraya Bhat","Doctor":"Hi,It is important to know current creatinine levels which will give an insight into the functioning of the kidney. The amount of albumin and proteins leaking in urine are also important. Kidney disease or damage that occurs in people with diabetes is called diabetic nephropathy. This condition is a complication of diabetes. In people with diabetes, the nephrons slowly thicken and become scarred over time. The kidneys begin to leak and protein (albumin) passes into the urine. When kidney damage is caught in its early stages, it can be slowed with treatment.Once larger amounts of protein appear in the urine, kidney damage will slowly get worse. If the second doctor has seen through the reports then he might be confident of making a diagnosis and wants to start treatment based on laboratory reports. Some doctors might wait for biopsy reports."},{"Patient":"my mom just got taken to the hospital and has liver and kidney failure now and she overdosed on trazadone sleeping pills and morphine pain pills and was wondering if she could die or have lasting effects from this.... thanks.  i have been dealing with these problems all of my life and i am 38yrs old.","Doctor":"Hi,Trazodone undergoes breakdown and metabolism in the liver. The metabolites, at least one of which is pharmacologically active, are excreted by the kidney. However, elderly patients are more likely to have hyponatremia (low sodium in the blood), which may require caution in patients receiving trazodone. Therapy with trazodone should be administered cautiously in patients with significantly impaired renal or liver function. Since you have written about over dose, it is important to study blood tests involving liver and kidney functions. Sudden death may not happen with an occasional overdose but long term effects of several incidents involving overdose can be harmful."},{"Patient":"good day doctor:i just want to ask for the situation of my father he had operation for kidney stone removal about 1 month ago he now 60yrs. old and at present he feel frequent dizziness for 3 days now he has no other complain except this.. is there something wrong with him?thanks a lot for ur answer and God bless..","Doctor":"Hi,Thanks for writing in.For the first 24 hours after going home, a patient may have some lightheadedness, dizziness, or sleepiness because of the medicines given to you during the procedure. However it is uncommon to have these symptoms for more than a day or two. It will help to know if he is having diabetes or hypertension which can be causing dizziness. This may not be related to the stone and he needs to consult a neurologist to know if there is any underlying problem to do with brain blood supply. Please do not ignore it and after consultation, few blood and imaging tests might be necessary to know where exactly is the problem."},{"Patient":"Hi, may I answer your health queries right now ?  Please type your query here...One of the symptoms my uncle experienced pre heart surgery was burping, he hoped this would resolve post surgery, but it has not. During surgery he had 5 by-passes and the cardiac surgeon had already told him he had extensive damage to his heart. Can you explain the burping?","Doctor":"Hello!Welcome and thank you for asking on HCM!I understand your concern, and would explain that the burping is not related to the heart. It is related to a stomach disorder or indigestion. Anxiety can also trigger burping. For this reason, I would recommend performing a fibrogastroscopy. Eating in small portions and avoiding spicy food can help too.

It may be left alone and ultrasound repeated after 6 months to know any change in size or appearance.The ovarian cyst with hydrosalphinx can be a concern, if you are a women in the younger age group and are having problems related to infertility. Hydrosalphinx is a condition where there is fluid collection in the tube connecting the ovary to the uterus. Inflammation of the tube can occur in infective and inflammatory conditions.As you are booked for ultrasound, probably a TVS (transvaginal ultrasound) this will show more clearly if it is indeed a cyst in the ovary and also causing fluid collection in the tube.

Subsequent percutaneous nephrolithostomy (PCNL) treatment was done to treat the stone. The serum creatinine level goes up due to urinary obstruction, probably the right kidney stone in your mother. Since the obstruction was present for some time in the past, the kidney function might have got affected. As per medical literature, a kidney stone causing obstruction for more than 10 days can cause obstructive uropathy which is  form of permanent damage leading to the kidney being unable to function properly. The raised creatinine is a consequence of this obstruction and a level of 1.4 is borderline high. It is most likely that the kidney was not much affected by the duration of obstruction by the stone. Serum creatinine is to be repeated after 2 - 3 months and it will most likely come down to normal.

No medicine is required for it.Gall bladder stone has to be evaluated in detail. A single stone up to 10 mm in diameter can be left alone and nothing needs to be done. If there are multiple stones then liver function tests are done for jaundice and any obstruction to flow of bile due to stone. The common bile duct is also evaluated for any obstruction.

After getting results of urine culture please discuss with your gynecologist if you need any change in antibiotics and as to what are the medications to be taken during pregnancy.

Very often, a cyst or two may be seen in the elderly and they measure up to 3 cm in size. Beyond 3 cm size, it it important to know the appearance and internal contents of the cyst. Exophytic cysts usually do not cause any difficulty when small in size. Only if they are more than 8 - 10 cm in diameter and are causing significant pressure effects, then a surgical treatment can be thought of. Medicines do not treat kidney cysts in any way.The Grade I prostatomegaly must be discussed with symptoms of any urinary retention. You can also get PSA levels done for better analysis.

A slight tendency towards any congenital posterior urethral valve must be looked into. You have not mentioned about the amount of amniotic fluid and I assume that is normal. Please continue the pregnancy without much anxiety as in most cases the baby will be normal and even if there is any small problem, it can be discussed with a pediatrician and urologist just after birth and corrected."}]`),x={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:C},data(){return{searchQuery:"",visibleCount:6,poemsData:M,isLoading:!1}},computed:{filteredPoems(){return this.searchQuery.trim()?this.poemsData.filter(a=>{const e=this.searchQuery.toLowerCase();return a.Patient.toLowerCase().includes(e)||a.Doctor.toLowerCase().includes(e)}).slice(0,this.visibleCount):this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(a=>setTimeout(a,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},E={class:"search-container"},R={class:"card-container"},N=["disabled"],q={key:0},U={key:1};function B(a,e,l,c,n,s){const y=f("PoemCard");return o(),i("section",null,[e[3]||(e[3]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🤔 AI effective tips collection 🧠")])],-1)),t("div",E,[e[2]||(e[2]=t("span",{class:"search-icon"},null,-1)),g(t("input",{type:"text",class:"search-input","onUpdate:modelValue":e[0]||(e[0]=r=>n.searchQuery=r),placeholder:"Search..."},null,512),[[p,n.searchQuery]])]),t("div",R,[(o(!0),i(w,null,b(s.filteredPoems,(r,m)=>(o(),k(y,{key:m,poem:r},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),s.hasMorePoems?(o(),i("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:n.isLoading,onClick:e[1]||(e[1]=(...r)=>s.loadMore&&s.loadMore(...r))},[n.isLoading?(o(),i("span",U,"Loading...")):(o(),i("span",q,"See more"))],8,N)):v("",!0)])}const Y=u(x,[["render",B],["__scopeId","data-v-dc444215"]]),W=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"deepseek/24.md","filePath":"deepseek/24.md"}'),O={name:"deepseek/24.md"},j=Object.assign(O,{setup(a){return(e,l)=>(o(),i("div",null,[I(Y)]))}});export{W as __pageData,j as default};
