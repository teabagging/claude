The typical course would be a generalized abdominal pain that, over time, becomes most intense on the lower right side. From the time the symptoms begin until the time the appendix ruptures is approximately 36-48 hours. So it is important to make the diagnosis early. If symptoms have lasted longer than this, or the pain has not become most intense on the lower right side, appendicitis is unlikely and the most common diagnosis is a bug, as your husband stated."},{"Patient":"Hi my baby is 10 weeks,she s suffering from stomachache,she s feeding well(breastmilk) but when I rub her to burp she cries and doesn t want to lean with her stomach and after that her stomach get hard now her stools r stringy and it hard for her to pass stools","Doctor":"Hi...This is called evening colic and is quite common in this age group.

Also, the father of this child wants his son to change the diapers of his 5 week old sister - to help them bond . Is this not strange, to say the least?","Doctor":"Yes that is inappropriate behaviour. Dont get angry on him, try to talk to him on this. Try to educate him on sex and explain him about how his friends familyand relatives will not love him if he does    this in public. Children like him have much curisity and is only enjoying the local feelings.

During or after an episode of viral infection particularly after taking some medications body may feel cold and clammy to touch. In post viral phases children try to recover their lost energy and weight so they sleep more. Nothing to worry about."},{"Patient":"Last night while sleeping my 12 year old daughter was struck with dizziness, blurred vision, ringing in her ears, nausea and a rise in body temperature. After a few minutes of relaxing on a cool floor the symptoms disappeared. She is fine this morning. Any ideas???","Doctor":"No definite diagnosis could be reached from the given information alone. If there no significant past history regarding any neurological disorder, a single episode like this is most likely an episode of a kind of bad dreams called night terror. Talk with her wether she is suffering from any tension or anxiety resently. If these episodes occur repeatedly give rivotril 2.5 at night for 2 weeks and see the result."},{"Patient":"My son was diagnosed with grade 4 and grade 5 reflux while in utero. He is now 11 months.

This is his first infection and I m wondering how much damage if any can the infection have on his kidneys?","Doctor":"Sorry to hear the news. As left ureter has a block which is resulting in worsening hydronephrosis, I think you will require a surgery to be done as early as possible because this obstruction will result in repeated kidney infection and ultimately gross kidney damage. However i need to know the degree of obstruction which you didnt mention... Till surgery could be done first the kidney infection has to be treated with iv antibiotics then he has to be kept on regular prophylactic antibiotics."},{"Patient":"I think my 8 year old daughter may have a bladder or urinary infection because she has wet the bed the last two nights, and has been running to the restroom every 5 minutes for the past three days.

As he was absolutely normal before surgery and his urine reports are also normal it could be psychological or neurometamolic cause. You need to do a water deprivation test from laboratory.

Does she feel breathless when she runs around or plays with other kids?4. Are the symptoms when there are seasonal changes?5. Is there any family history of asthma or any other sort of allergies like skin allergy etc.?6. Is the cough always associated with fever?If your answer is yes for any of the above questions, your kid might be having viral associated wheezing or multi triggered wheezing and I suggest you meet a paediatric pulmonologist who is near your place.

I just read through your question. This is a very common occurrence at this age. The good news is that baby skin heals very well, and faster than adults. The most I recommend doing is applying any over-the-counter antibiotic ointment (ie: bacitracin, neosporin, etc...) three times per day. This will ensure that the scrapes won't become infected. Outside of that, just give it time and it will heal very well."},{"Patient":"Our newborn had an eye infection when he was 5 days old.  Doc had us treating it with erythromycin three times a day for a week.  We discontinued and with in three days it came back and now is in both eyes.  A green discharge...what else can we do other then continue him on the erythromycin? Should we be worried about any serious side effects or problems with this infection?","Doctor":"Hello. I just read through your question.One diagnosis to consider in babies this young is something called \\" Nasolacrimal Duct Obstruction\\". It means that the duct in the eye that is responsible for draining tears is too narrow. This makes it unable to drain naturally produced tears fast enough. What results is a build up of fluid on the surface of the eye that can be either clear or colored. It can sometimes lead to infection. Most cases resolve on their own by 6 months of age. If it doesn't resolve, it's important to have the baby seen by a pediatric Ophthalmologist. Meantime, it is important to keep the eye clean by wiping with a damp cloth or cotton balls."},{"Patient":"ABDOMINAL PAIN SINCE 15 DAYS ,TOOK MEDICINE BUT IT IS RECURRENT PLZ SUGGEST SOME TIPS TO STAY HEALTHY","Doctor":"Hello and welcome to healthcare forum.

I am sorry that your granddaughter is not well. Most of such fevers are caused by viruses. Antibiotics are ineffective and all you need to do is to keep the temperature in control by cold sponging and use of medicines like paracetamol. There is a viral condition called infectious mononucleosis which looks similar to Strep throat and should not be treated with antibiotics. Gurgle with lukewarm water should help. Only in case the blood work reveals raised WBC count, it would indicate a bacterial infection which can be treated with antibiotics. If the fever lasts for more than 7-10 days a test should be done to rule out typhoid.With the little information that I can get from your query this is all that I can say in order to guide you.

I am sorry that your daughter is not well. The red dot you are talking about is probably is a subconjunctival haemorrhage.

I am sorry that your son is not well. He probably has a gastro intestinal infection which is often caused by a virus called rotavirus though it could also be caused by certain bacteria. Antibiotics have been given to control it but in case the cause is viral, it is unlikely to respond. The temperature needs to be kept in control by cold sponging and use of medicines like paracetamol. Although you have not indicated the location of the lymph nodes, let me mention that in case of an infection, the lymph nodes try to limit the infection from spreading and get swollen in the process. So that is probably the case here.To keep the temperature in control, I would suggest you to sponge the child with water at room temperature. You can give him a bath too when the temperature is high.

If I could examine her, I would have tried to find out the location of the tenderness in her abdomen. It is hard to comment without knowing the exact location. If it is located just below the sternum/chestbone or around the navel, it could be due to gastritis. In that case I would have suggested her to eat small but frequent meals and not to keep the stomach empty. There could be other causes but it is hard to comment without examining.I could suggest you to exclude milk based (except for curd/yogurt) and wheat based products from her diet and see if it helps.

I am sorry that your nephew has suffered a bad fall. Head injuries are serious if there is intracranial cerebral bleeding or damage where surgical intervention is likely to be required but as you say that is not the case. The bleeding from right ear is indicative of a posterior fossa injury or fracture and could be serious. The swelling in the right occipital area if present on the outside of the skull should indicate scalp haematoma and is not of much concern.The ominious signs to look for in case of a head injury are severe head ache, torrential vomiting, unconsciousness and seizures. You would also have to keep unsteady gait and dizziness in consideration on account of the posterior fossa injury.Hope that I have been able to answer your query.

What could this be ? She is pained when she is picked up under that arm right at the axillary space .","Doctor":"Thanks for posting your query at healthcaremagic. Let me mention that X-Ray films can only reveal fractures or bony injuries. They cannot identify the soft tissue injury that could have occurred. So, the injury to ligaments that connect two bones, is not clear in an X-Ray. Although your niece has not broken a bone, the ligaments between two bones have probably been injured and hence she is suffering from pain and movement restriction. The prominent veins are probably an unrelated incidental finding.Hot compress over the affected region should give her relief.

It is more likely to be an antibiotic associated diarrhoea rather than a viral diarrhoea in this case.You can give him steam inhalation which will help in relieving the cough. After the course of antiobiotics are completed, the stool should gradually normalise. If I had a patient like this, I would give Enterogermina alongwith.

Snoring can occur due to mutiple causes. Most commonly the problem is in the tongue base as the tongue falls back in sleep and causes the obstruction. In that case, even the removal of the adenoids may not give you relief until the tongue base is reshaped. For a child of 7 years, I think you should wait. However, a sleep profiling needs to be done to evaluate whether she is having sleep apnea or whether she is getting proper sleep as it may hamper her growth.

Today morning, i gave him snother dose of calpol and meftal-p and baby is sleeping peacefully. I am giving calopl drops 1.5ml and meftal-p 5 ml . Baby weighs 10- 10.5 kg. shall i continue this medication for 2 more days? Pls advice.","Doctor":"Hithanks for posting your query at HealthCareMagicFor a 10 kg baby max dose allowed in 24 hours is 600 mg of paracetamol ,Calpol drops contain 100 mg of paracetamol in one ml.You can  give max four doses in 24 hourls.Regarding Mefanamic acid , Meftal P you can give 3 doses in 24 hours.If fever us not coming down you can do tepid sponging(not cold sponnging).But fever is high you need to consult your pediatrician to rule out any serious issue.Hope I answered your querythanks."},{"Patient":"Dear doctor, my daughter is 2 years old.

I gave her crocin drops (1.2ml) for 3times bt she still has fever. Now I m thinking to give her calpol(120mg) bt I m also giving her iron &multivitamin drops. Is it safe to give calpol with iron drops & i just wanted to know how much dose should i give her (baby s weight is 8.2kg)? Thanks","Doctor":"Thanks for posting your query at HealthCareMagic. Calpol and crocin both are brandnames of paracetamol. Paracetamol is a very safe drug. The drops contain 100mg/ml whereas the syrup contains 120mg/5ml. The dose requirement is 15mg/kg/dose and can be given three or four times a day but at a minimum interval of 4 hours. So 1.2 ml of the drop or 5 ml of the syrup would be ok for her. There is no problem if given along with or after iron and multivitamin drops.Hope that helps.

Let me ascertain that there is no medicine that helps in gaining weight. Cyproheptidine is a drug that is supposed to increase appetite but its effectivity is doubtful and there is no proof in its favour. But at the same time when parents demand some medicine for the weight gain of the child, doctors have nothing else other than this medicine or vitamins. Vitamin supplements too are ineffective as they are required in very small amounts and we can get adequate amounts anyway through normal diet provided that we do not have a specific deficiency. So the only way that your child can gain weight is to take more proteins and carbohydrates through diet. Protein is responsible for the body mass and is available in meat, fish, eggs, carrots, spinach, soyabeans, pulses etc. whereas carbohydrate is available from cereals. No medicine will help.I hope that this will clarify your doubts.

What is the difference between Ambrolite S and D ? Regards, Gokul","Doctor":"Thanks for posting your query at HealthCareMagic. Your son has a respiratory tract infection. Usually it is caused due to a virus and has an allergic component associated. Both Ambrolite D and Ambrolite S are safe to be given. Dose is ok. Ambrolite S contains ambroxol, guaiphenesin and salbutamol whereas Ambrolite D contains Cetirizine, Dextromethorphan, Pseudoephedrine and Menthol. The actions are similar. The main difference is due to the salbutamol which is a bronchodilator that helps in widening the airway tracts when there are spasms that cause wheezing.Hope that I have been able to address your queries.

Dogs, like other mammals are prone to having a disease called rabies which is lethal in humans and does not have any cure. I would strongly suggest that you get your child vaccinated immediately with the proper course of anti rabies vaccine. The fever that you are talking about is not low grade and probably due to a bacterial infection that might have occurred during the skin breach. He may require some antibiotics after the blood work has been done. Please contact your pediatrician.Hope that I have been able to address your queries.

Is anythin to be worried or concerned?","Doctor":"Thanks for posting your query at HealthCareMagic. Odomos contains a neurotoxic substance that can cause symptoms including stomach upset. If it is more than 4 hours after he could have taken it, stomach wash would not be helpful. If he is ok at the moment you can wait and observe and no need to worry. In any case if he has not ingested it, there is not much to be concerned. But in case of any sort of complications, rush to a hospital.

Could it be the formula?","Doctor":"Thanks for posting your query at HealthCareMagic. Ideally (as per American Academy of Pediatrics as well as World Health Organisation) a two month old baby should be exclusively breast fed for 6 months after which weaning with semi solid food like mashed boiled food or cereal based formula is done. I would not recommend introduction of rice at this age though many baby food companies market their \\"stage 1\\" foods to children between 4 and 6 months old with the precaution that the food is meant to be consumed in addition to breast milk or formula. So, try switching back to breast milk if adequate amount can be procured.  In case of an working mother, breast milk can be expressed and stored in a refrigerator. If not, formula feeds including similac alimentum may be given. It is hypoallergenic. I do not know if your baby has milk allergy or a similar condition due to which the pediatrician asked him to take such a formula in addition to rice. It is not likely to cause paleness during sleep. The paleness can be evaluated by checking the hemoglobin content of blood.Hope that would resolve your queries.

Procencephaly is a condition where the cerebrum of our brain does not develop properly. Our nerves are made of basic unit neurons which have a small cell body and a long axon. The axons have an insulation. These insulated portions are arranged in the white matter while the cell bodies lie in the grey matter. Since he has paucity of the insulation or white matter, there is short circuit when the brain fires an impulse and a convulsion results. He is receiving valparin to prevent such convulsions. Since the brain controls the muscles, lack of portions that controls various muscles leads to hypotonia as a result of which there is no head holding.There is not cure for the condition as new brain tissue cannot be created.

And is there any diet which mom should follow to help breastfed baby?","Doctor":"Thanks for posting your query at HealthCareMagic. Do not worry. It is normal for a small child to pass stool once in 10 days as is passing 10 times in one day. Just continue giving him breast feeds. If you can, it might be helpful to increase the amount of breast milk to 100% if feasible.Whatever a mother eats is basically what the baby gets. Just eat a healthy diet but it is basically for two persons not one. You may like to include all sorts of flavours which will enrich your baby's taste.

Any thoughts, advice?","Doctor":"Thanks for posting your query at HealthCareMagic. The fever in your son indicates an infection. The location of the infection is not clear from your description but it could be in the intestines for which he could get a tummy ache. The post nasal drip is probably due to an allergic component of some infection that is more likely to be respiratory. But since you say that he does not have a cough, the chances are low. It would be best to consult a doctor directly who would be able to say better and intervene accordingly. I would not advise you to self medicate.Hope that will take care of your query.

Many of the children of such an age suffer from respiratory tract infections. These are generally viral infections and where antibiotics are not likely to be effective. These conditions resolve spontaneously in 5-10 days and probably that is what you are talking about. Many children may have enlarged tonsils with a tendency to have recurrent infections. With age the frequency of such infections generally comes down.The fever has to be kept in control by the use of medicines like paracetamol or cold sponging.Hope that will adequately address your query.

It will be great help if you can suggest some best medicine. Regards Sunil","Doctor":"Thanks for posting your query at HealthCareMagic. It is difficult to comment on the exact cause without putting my hand on his abdomen. Gastritis is a common cause of abdominal pain that your doctor has suspected and tried to treat. Gastritis can cause an ulcer that might be painful and might take some time to resolve.The location of the abdominal pain in case of gastritis is upper or around umbilicus. Central abdominal pain can also be due to an infection but generally it is associated with diarrhoea. In case of acute appendicitis, the pain is in lower right. Pancreatitis is another possibility where the pain may or may not radiate to the back. It may or may not be associated with vomiting. Bowel obstruction is another possibility. But without diagnosing the actual condition randomly treatment cannot be done. Your doctor would be able to help better.Hope that will take care of your query.

He hasn t been eating well in the last couple of days, but I thought May be it s the heat as he will drink lots any agrees to eat juicy fruits, he is diagnosed with toddlers diharria so his stool is soft and watery most of the time,","Doctor":"Thanks for posting your query at HealthCareMagic. Toddler's diarrhoea is a common cause of chronic (persistent) nonspecific diarrhoea affecting children between the ages of 1 and 5 years. Toddler's diarrhoea is not serious and the child is well and resolves eventually as the age progresses. You can often see bits of vegetable food in the stools (such as bits of undigested rice, carrot, sweetcorn, etc). These have come from a recent meal. Toddler's diarrhoea is not due to malabsorption (poor absorption) of food or to a serious bowel problem. It is also not due to an intolerance of a type of food.Do not give children too much fruit juice or squash. If you do give your child squash or juice, make sure that it is very well diluted. Changing the fibre content of the diet may be helpful, as very low- or high-fibre intakes may make symptoms worse in some children. Fibre (roughage) is the part of plant food that is not digested. It stays in the gut and is passed in the stools (faeces). Fibre is present in many foods, in particular in fruit, wholemeal bread and vegetables. So, if your child has a low-fibre diet, it may help to increase the fibre in the diet to normal levels. This is simply achieved by eating a healthy balanced diet that includes some fruit and vegetables.Hope that will take care of your problem.

What to do pls help me","Doctor":"Thanks for posting your query at HealthCareMagic. The cough and cold is an expression of respiratory tract infection. Most often it is caused due to certain viruses. Sometimes there is a superadded bacterial infection for which antibiotics are prescribed. Antibiotics are ineffective against viruses. Fever generally indicates infection. In case of viral infections, the condition resolves spontaneously in 5-10 days. In any case when antibiotics are prescribed, they also kill the beneficial bacteria that reside in our intestines. As a result diarrhoea results. The situation can be improved by giving curd/yogurt which contains lactobacilli. Enterogermina sachets can also be given for the same.Advent is an antibiotic. Nexpro junior contains omeprazole to reduce acidity that may be caused by the medications. Prospan is a cough syrup. At times certain medicines are not well tolerated. So vomiting may occur. Continue the medicines as prescribed by your doctor.Hope that would solve your queries.

She also sucks on her hand and/or thumb when she s hungry or comforting herself to sleep. I wanted to put petroleum jelly in her hair to keep it from getting dry scalp etc but I m wondering if the constant digestion of the petroleum jelly will have a negative effect?","Doctor":"Hello. I just read through your question.Petroleum jelly is non-toxic. Ingestion cannot do any harm. At worst, there might be some mild abdominal pain. Nothing more harmful than that. There is no need for concern."},{"Patient":"I have a six year old child who has seasonal allergies.. Have been giving him Claritin... But all of a sudden today is not well and has a fever of 102.3... Complaining of head ache and very tired ....I am going to give him an Advil ...should I be very alarmed? Does a fever accompany what I think are allergies? I was like this when I was a child , so this is why I am thinking it s just allergies getting worse..please let me know","Doctor":"Hello. I just read through your question. Though allergy is probably a big component of what is going on,  the 102.3 fever indicates it's not the only component. This is too high a fever to attribute to allergy alone. The most likely diagnosis is a harmless viral illness that will ultimately pass on it's own. However, if the fever lasts more than 2-3 days, it could indicate a bacterial infection requiring antibiotics. In this case, I recommend consulting with your doctor."},{"Patient":"hi, my daughter is 4 years old from time to time she says my stomach is hearing I m not sure if it s paining her or she is just playing and saying this. now i realized since 2 weeks that if i put my ear on her stomach i hear noises like gurgling but i can t hear it unless i put my ear on her stomach is it something dangerous or normal?","Doctor":"Hello. I just read through your question.If your daughter appears to be behaving like her usual self, (ie. Interacting well, playing appropriately with her friends, etc...) It is less likely that she is experiencing real abdominal pain. The gurgling you hear when you put your ear to her abdomen is normal. It's absence would indicate a problem. So there is no need for concern."},{"Patient":"my daughter swam into a step in our pool and scraped her face. a bump has popped up and its squishy...should I be concerned? She said her head doesn t hurt or she doesn t feel like she is going to throw up. She wants to go to bed but I afraid to let her sleep.","Doctor":"Hello. I just read through your question. This happens often. The fact that she didnt lose consciousness upon impact indicates that no brain injury occurred.the swelling is going to last for several days before it heals, and this is normal. The only other sign to watch out for is vomiting.  As long as this doesn't happen, there is no need for concern.

As long as she remains well hydrated there is no need to be concerned. If she continues to vomit and start to become dehydrated, I recommend consulting with your doctor. Otherwise, you can allow her to heal on her own."},{"Patient":"My 3 yr old son has been blinking his eyes almost every 20-40 secs and does not seem aware he is doing it.

His eyes are not pink, unfortunately I dont have drops to put in at the moment but he is not complaining of sore eyes.","Doctor":"Hello. I just read through your question. What your describing sounds like your son may be developing a tic. These can be brought on by fatigue, or anxiety, or for no reason at all. Any eyedrops you would have considered would probably not make much different. I recommend you consult with your doctor and get a referral for a good pediatric neurologist.

Though recovery from lazy eye at this age is unusual, it's still better to be seen by an ophthalmologist. The eye centers frequently mishandle these types of things."},{"Patient":"HI, my daughter is 5 yrs old. In the evening she drinks pediasure 3 scoops in 200 ml water. Around 7 or 8 o clock she says she got acidity and afternoon food is coming up. not vomitting. sometimes complains of stomach pain. does not have appetite for dinner. lost weight. bowl movement irregular and hard. says she has got pain when passing stool. do i give her neopeptine syrup and what dose?","Doctor":"Thanks for expressing your query at HealthCareMagic. I have gone through the details provided by you and understand the cause of your concern. Let me first explain what happens normally. Acid is secreted continually by our stomach and is meant to be helpful for digestion. But if the gap between meals is more, more acid gets accumulated and this can now cause ulcer. The solution would be to put small amount of meals at frequent intervals so that the acid does not need to sit idle and can act rather fruitfully. The bowel movements are supposed to move the food downward upto the anus as the digestion proceeds on the way. The acid also comes down in same manner and does not accumulate if the bowel habits are regular. Regular activity/play and fibre rich foods enhance the stool formation and bowel movements. Give your daughter small but frequent meals and include isabgol husk in her diet (at dinner) along with more green leafy vegetables. In the evening give her some solid food containing both carbohydrate and protein, rather than giving supplements. I hope that will take care of the situation.Although many doctors advise neopeptine, I would not insist on giving neopeptine to her as it is broken down by gastric acid and is not quite effective in assisting digestion.Hope that the above information would be helpful. Feel free to revert back in case of further queries if any."},{"Patient":"HI, my child had and injury on his face the blackness spread to the eye. This was on May 2014, I took him to his pediatrician he had his eye check, x ray but he still has a black mark under his eye, the pediatrician says is allergy? I believe is something else it has been to long and the eye drops for the allergy has not reduce the mark.","Doctor":"Thanks for posting your query at HealthCareMagic. By blackness do you mean a black circle around the eye, what is commonly called black eye? Let me mention that the tissue around the eyes is loose and does not contain much fat padding. As a result, in case of an injury to the forehead or any other area close by, when some amount of bleeding occurs, it gets accumulated in the loose connective area surrounding the eyes. With time as the blood becomes degraded, the colour changes from red to brown, purple, bluish and blackish. This is what gives rise to a black eye. In a week or so, it resolves spontaneously without any treatment. So, you need not worry about that. Stay relaxed.Hope I could clarify your doubt. Feel free to revert back in case of any other further queries."},{"Patient":"my toddler 2 years and 2 month has hit her head of the corner of a radiator end tip of eyebrow its become a hard lump I applies ice on and its still the same she seems fine and fell asleep after half hour prior to the bump is this lump ball normal and what signs do I watch out for thank you ,yours sincerely.cidra najeeb","Doctor":"Thanks for posting your query at HealthCareMagic. You have not indicated how old the injury is. In case of a recent injury, as the body tries to repair the wound, there might be some amount of swelling in the affected region. There can also be some amount of blood collection in the affected area. It is hard to comment without directly observing the area. If she does not have complaints about it, you can wait and see if it resolves. If not, it would be better to see a doctor who can examine it and intervene if necessary.Hope I have been able to address your cause of concern.

Also give him steam inhalation which will help in diluting the cough and help the situation. I hope that will take care of the situation.

You are talking about diarrhoea in a 4 month old child. You have not indicated whether your baby is exclusively breast fed or is on milk substitutes. Usually it is caused by a virus called rotavirus. In case of feeding with milk substitutes, irrespective of how well you sterilise the containers, there is always a scope of contamination. It is therefore quite common for bottlefed or spoon fed babies to have recurrent episodes of diarrhoea. Breast feed is therefore always the best. In case of milk substitues, ORS needs to be given in case of diarrhoea. In case your baby is breast fed, continue breast feeding as it it better than ORS. This is important so that the child does not lose salt and water from his body. The frequency of passing urine will indicate whether the feeds are adequate.Continue the medication prescribed by your doctor for the prescribed duration.Hope I have been able to address your cause of concern.

SPF, or Sun Protection Factor, is a measurement of how well a sunscreen will protect skin from UVB rays, the kind of radiation that causes sunburn. If your skin would normally burn after 10 minutes in the sun, for example, wearing an SPF 15 sunscreen would theoretically allow you to stay in the sun for 150 minutes (10 x 15) without burning. This is a rough estimate, however.30 minutes before you go outside, apply an ounce of sunscreen.applying sunscreen just before you go into sun will not be effective.Hope this answer helpsRegardsDr. Shesh"},{"Patient":"My son is 9 years old now at age 5 and 1/2 he was dignosed with Pertheses Disease at his last appointment they said it was gone.

An active is a well kid even if she/ he is not eating well. 2. Development of a kid is as important as or I would say even more important than growth alone.3. As the kids grow their interest in food decreases and interest in play activities increases so that they eat small quantity and run away to play. As parents we need to be more patient and feed than less quantity but more aliquots per day.4. This age rather than the quantity of the food I suggest you concentrate more on the number of times you feed her and also make whatever you feed her calorie dense by adding good amount of ghee to it.5. I suggest you not to use appetite stimulants on long run as they may cause drowsiness.At his age interest in play increases and interest in food decreases. This is quite natural. If he is active and playing around you need not worry. This age rather than the quantity of the food I suggest you concentrate more on the number of times you feed him and also make whatever you feed him calorie dense by adding good amount of ghee to it.This is not related to teething. If your kid is active and developmentally normal, please do not worry.Hope my answer was helpful for you.  I am happy to help any time.

I gave her benedryl and the rash/ bunps went away. She is still pale and is napping but her mother and I noticed a raised pea size bump on her right temple and another just below her left eyebrow. Is this a virus leaving her body? Or are we dealing with something else?","Doctor":"Hi...I feel this is a sort of skin allergy or urticaria.

I gave him ibuprofen about 20min prior to him vomiting, after he was complaining of his head hurting after a nap today. Should I be worried about the headache?","Doctor":"Hi...a kid who is behaving normally even with headache is not having something serious. But I take this opportunity to tell you about the red flag signs when you need to take him to the paediatrician - 1. Vomiting continuously2. Seizures3. Watery of bloody discharge from ears and nose4. Unconsciousness5. Altered sensorium or behaviour. You were right in giving him Ibuprofen. If the above symptoms appear or if the headache is bothering his daily activities, consult his paediatrician.Regards - Dr. Sumanth"},{"Patient":"My daughter, who is in her 40 s, has Crohn s disease. When she was 7 years old, she had severe pain, at which time we thought was appendicitis. The doctor thought it was merely a virus. After 2 weeks, she was admitted to the hospital. The doctors determined she had a disease that occurs in the intestines and a rash broke out on her legs. They told us the name of the disease (named after a French man or men) but we cannot remember the name of it. Our daughter will be going to Cleveland Clinic soon and we would like to be able to give them more detailed medical history. Thank you.","Doctor":"Hi...It could be Henoch Schonlein Purpura and this is based on the minimal information provided like - severe intestinal pain and rash on legs.

Be rest assured that the tonsils are not the cause for vomiting. Regarding fever - Paracetamol can be given in the dose of 15mg/kg/dose every 4-6th hourly that too only if fever is more than 100F. I suggest not using combination medicines for fever, especially with Paracetamol.Vomiting medicines are prescription drugs and you need to approach your paediatrician for this.regards - Dr. Sumanth"},{"Patient":"Hello my child got into bleach he didnt throw up and he seems perfectly fine.

Initially if they have appeared with fever, that means it could be a viral illness associated problem. But this recurrence, seems to an urticarial rash or allergic rash. Do not worry.

Give her ORS to prevent her from losing salt and water from her body. You may give her Ondem (ondansertron) syrup to control her vomiting. Unless I have her body weight I cannot give your the exact dose required for her. About the cause, I would suggest you not to bother at the moment. In most cases irrespective of your treating the cause, the vomiting and loose motion comes down in a few days. So if you are replenishing the fluids with ORS, stay relaxed.Hope that helps.

Thank you. Alifiya","Doctor":"Thanks for asking your question at HealthCareMagic. Your son is probably suffering from a condition called bronchiolitis which is caused by a virus and affects children between 6 months to 3 years of age. In most cases it is a self limiting disease but often requires nebulisation. If he is wheezing, duolin needs to be given. But if he is not, rather give him nebulisation with 3% NaCl solution (hypertonic saline) and it should help. Do not give budecort more than twice a day. I am unable to listen to the chest of the child and needed to evaluate whether there is likelihood of superadded bacterial infection which needs to be treated with antibiotics. Some antiallergic like levocetirizine also might be required. He may also need to be assessed for chronic diseases like tuberculosis. Get in touch with your doctor who would be able to tell you more.The commonest side effect of duolin is increased heart rate. About the side-effects, they are there but you need not worry.

Give her ondansetron syrup (available in brandnames like zofer, ondem etc.) to control her vomiting. Had I known her body weight, I could have given you the dose required for her. Meanwhile give her ORS so that the water and salt balance of her body remains proper. ORS will help in correcting dehydration. Give it to her frequently in sips.

I understand the cause of concern. Let me mention that the tolerated but common side effect of anti-allergics like Benadryl is sleepiness. Amoxycillin is an antibiotic and while killing the bad bugs it also eliminates the good bacteria that reside in our bowels. As a result sometimes mild diarrhoea or signs of vitamin B deficiency may occur. It can be overcome by giving curd/yogurt which contain lactobacilli. Prebiotics and probiotics (available in brand names like Vizylac, enterogermina) can also be give. Tylenol is a very safe drug. Let me tell you that these are very frequently used and safe drugs and you need not worry about serious side effects when giving these drugs. I hope that helps.

Had I been able to look directly at it, it would have been easier for me to assess. But usually such injuries get recovered in 5-7 days or earlier. Continue the cold compress and the pain medication.

Had you mentioned the weight of the child, the temperatures recorded, the nature of fever and whether he is having associated symptoms like cough , it would have been easier for me to commentt. Most commonly such fevers are due to viral cause which are not relieved on treatment with antibiotics. These are self correcting conditions that automatically resolve in a few days.Bactoclav is same as Bactoclav D Syrup and contains Amoxycillin+Clavulanic Acid.However, it could also due to typhoid or certain other reasons and might need to get investigated.

It would have been easier for me to comment had I known the weight of the child. If the weight and weight gain seem fine, stay relaxed. There seems to be nothing abnormal. Give her a fibre containing diet containing a combination of semi solids. You may try giving her diet free from wheat and wheat based products to see if there is relief.

Although this is most commonly caused due to a virus, it can have a super added bacterial infection.Novamox is an antibiotic that kills the beneficial intestinal bacteria along with the bad ones. This causes the diarrhoea she had suffered from in the earlier episode after taking the same prescribed medicine.Chances are that she would have the same problem once again. Better start giving her curd/yogurt which contains beneficial lactobacillus. You can also give her a sachet of Enterogermina or Vizylac (which contain prebiotics and probiotics) twice daily. Sometimes, certain medicines are not well tolerated by the babies. You may use Ondem syrup half an hour before the meals or before the medicines in order to ensure that the medicines are not vomited out. Discuss about the prior episode with your doctor and surely he will keep that in account. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further.Regards,Dr. Diptanshu Das"},{"Patient":"I have a 3 1/2 yr old son who just started preschool last week. Today he has a bad cough, runny nose, and I just noticed Some mild petechiae on his cheeks. He hasn t had a fever but I ve been giving him Motrin. He s only had 2 of his DTaP vaccines. Should I be concerned?","Doctor":"Thanks for putting your query up at HealthCareMagic. Probably your little son has a respiratory tract infection. Generally these are caused due to a viral infection and have an allergic component as well. Fever may also occur. The petechiae on the cheeks may be due to rupture of small blood vessels just below the skin due to forceful coughing. There is no need to be concerned at the moment. But the condition might require serious attention in case the petechial spots expand or recur elsewhere. I hope that this has not occurred just after the dose of DTaP. Do not worry because only two doses have been delivered. Just give the next dose as per schedule.Giving him some antiallergic and steam inhalation is likely to give him some relief. I hope that helps. Feel free to revert back in case of further queries if any."},{"Patient":"Is it possible to get a concussion from roller coaster rides? My ten year old son started to feel sick to his stomach after riding a few roller coasters...he is now dizzy with a bad headache. He says everything spins when he opens his eyes. I gave him advil thinking it was a migraine but I am now wondering if it could be something more serious from the rides.","Doctor":"Thanks for posting your query at HealthCareMagic. The condition that you are reporting has been caused by dysfunction of the vestibulo-cochlear apparatus. I do not think that any concussion has occurred.Let me explain in further detail. There is a vestibulo-cochlear apparatus in our inner ear which is responsible for maintaining our balance. This gives the sense when we get up from lying position or when we turn our head. When the child got into the roller coaster, the vestibulo-cochlear apparatus was bombarded with stimulus which it had not faced earlier. As a result it could not decide whether the body is in upright or reclining position and got confused. The dizziness has resulted from this. Some stabliser of the vestibulo-cochlear apparatus can provide him relief. You may give him Stemetil tablets. Since I do not know his age and weight, I would not be able to give you the exact dose he requires. Get in touch with your pediatrician and he will guide you.Hope that helps. Feel free to revert back in case of further queries if any."},{"Patient":"My grandson(26 months) has a rash on his trunk( back and front). He has been running a low grade fever at times for the past couple of days. He is also teething and has said his mouth hurts. Could this be serious like, scarlet fever? Might it be related to teething?","Doctor":"Thanks for posting your query at HealthCareMagic. There are many causes of rashes with fever. Most of them are viral and relatively harmless. Scarlet fever is a similar condition but caused by a bacteria. Fever may also occur due to an infection acquired during teething. There is no cause of worry if the mouth hurts. It would have been better if I could have a direct look at the rashes. I would therefore recommend you to get it examined by your pediatrician who would be better able to diagnose it.I hope that helps.

APGAR score of 8 at the time of birth is good. She probably has been suffering from a condition called chronic suppurative otitis media (CSOM) due to her adoids. Our ear has three parts. The ear drum separates the outer and middle compartments. There is a narrow tube deep inside that connects the throat with the middle compartment. This tube often gets blocked when the adenoids increase in size. As a result the air pressure inside the middle ear cannot get balanced and creates a suction force on the eardrum. It also may cause an infection to accumulate in the middle ear. A small tube called gromet may be placed on the eardurm in order to equalise the pressure. The gromet will come out on its own.So, I hope that you now understand how the infections (CSOM) was being caused and what has been done to take care of the situation. This CSOM was the cause of her hearing loss. If there is no other cause of hearing loss, her hearing is expected to come back to normal after the infection subsides.I hope that helps.

You can give the child Albend syrup (Albendazole) at the dose of 6 mg/kg (syrup contains 20 mg/ml) at night. [I could have given the exact dose if you had mentioned the body weight of the child.] Repeat the dose after 14 days. I hope that would give the baby relief.Hope that helps.

The process of introducing solids into the diet from exclusive breast feeding (or at times formula feed) is called weaning. Do not worry if the child does not like it initially. It is a new taste that he is not yet familiar with. You have correctly started with potato, carrots and sweet potatoes but also include some cereals like boiled rice and pulses. You may also give cerelac (wheat or rice). Do not worry as they are safe for your baby.The best alternative that you may provide at home is making a khichdi sort of thing by mixing the cereals, vegetables and boiling them and mashing them up.Hope that helps.

The dentist did advise that if the swelling should start to increase to the media range to the face to take to the ER. My concern at this moment is should we monitor for tonight or take him to the ER?","Doctor":"Hello,Antibiotic treatment usually takes at least 24 hours to be effective. Take all doses at correct prescription times. I suggest taking anti-inflammatory medication along with the antibiotic prescription at regular intervals. If possible, a combination of Tylenol and Advil can be very effective in controlling the spread of inflammation. Consult with your dentist for proper dosage based on weight and age of your child.I suggest calling the dentist to discuss the degree of increased swelling. This should help make the decision since your dentist is familiar with your son's condition. Any severe swelling should be treated at the ER. Sometimes one antibiotic is not effective and needs to be changed. Sometimes a stronger doses are required initially or during treatment to be effective. You must fully complete antibiotic prescriptions. If you are in any doubt about your son's health, you cannot be wrong by making a trip to the ER. Close monitoring is advised as it is not uncommon for an increase in symptoms before the antibiotic is fully effective.Thank you for your inquiry.

I am sorry that your daughter has dermatomyositis. Dermatomyositis (DM) is a connective-tissue disease that is characterized by inflammation of the muscles and the skin. While DM most frequently affects the skin and muscles, it is a systemic disorder that may also affect the joints, the esophagus, the lungs, and, less commonly, the heart. The mechanism is immune-mediated damage of microscopic vessels of skin and muscles and gives rise to muscle atrophy. The diagnosis can be confirmed by muscle biopsy, EMG,and blood tests. This disease has no known cure but the immune reactions that result in the disease, can be kept in control using certain medicines. She therefore needs the medicines and it is no need to  worry about side-effects as without them the condition would worsen even further.Dermatomyositis is often associated with celiac disease and hence a gluten-free diet is recommended. In other words avoid wheat based products altogether. It is believed that certain dietary regimens like Paleo Diet are beneficial.Okay To Eat: Fruits, Vegetables, Lean Meats, Seafood, Legumes, Nuts & Seeds and Healthy Fats having omega-3 fish oil.Avoid: Dairy, Grains, Processed Food & Sugars, Starches and Alcohol.Eating your food as close to raw as possible is recommended.Hope that helps.

There is a condition called bronchiolitis which commonly affects children of this age. Probably your grandson has it. It is caused by a virus called respiratory syncitial virus (RSV) although certain other viruses like Adenovirus, Influenza and Parainfluenza virus may also cause it. It is unlikely to have been caused by MERS virus. Although he has not got much relief, I would insist that the nebulization be continued.

We all know what to do now, etc. but I have not gotten any answers as to why some children who have fevers get them and some who have fevers do not. Any info on that?","Doctor":"Thanks for enquiring at HealthCareMagic. It is possible for anyone to have a fit, but some people are more likely than others to have one. The brains of some infants and young children are very sensitive to rises in body temperature they may have a convulsion when they have a fever.The fit usually occurs while the child's temperature is rising rapidly at the beginning of an illness and most often occurs on the first day of the illness. Please note that about 1 in 25 children will have a febrile convulsion. Febrile convulsions occur between the ages of 6 months and 5 years and are less common after the age of 5 yearsthere is an increased chance of your child having a febrile convulsion if a close relative had febrile convulsions as a child. The tendency to febrile convulsions runs in families. Children who are developmentally delayed or who have spent more than 28 days in a neonatal intensive care unit are also more likely to have a febrile seizure. Moreover, one of 4 children who have a febrile seizure will have another, usually within a year. So you can see that some children have increased risk but it is difficult to comment on the exact predilection. I hope that helps.

I, along with his father, teacher and grandma, are concerned! There is also a patch of dry, flaky skin (almost reptile looking/feeling) where the bump is.

She is on a prescription for zyrtec that she takes daily she has been taking that. Is it just allergies or something else","Doctor":"Thanks for posting your query at HealthCareMagic. Most of the cough and fever that occur, are due to viral causes. There is a condition called bronchiolitis which usually affects children under the age of 2, with a peak age of 3 to 6 months. It is a common, and sometimes severe illness. Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is the most common cause. More than half of all infants are exposed to this virus by their first birthday. Other viruses that can cause bronchiolitis include: Adenovirus, Influenza and Parainfluenza.The virus is spread to infants by coming into direct contact with nose and throat fluids of someone who has the illness. Usually such a viral infection also has an allergic component. Zyrtec (cetirizine) is an antiallergic used to treat such conditions.I hope that helps.

The cause of foul smelling stools may be indigestion (malabsorption) or infection of the bowels. I am not sure that blueberries would provide him relief. If you are giving him gluten free diet, please make sure that he has coeliac disease. If coeliac disease has already been diagnosed, the reason would be the malabsorption caused due to this disease where the epithelial lining of the intestinal cells is affected. These cells contain the enzymes required for the digestion. Since these cells are damaged, malabsorption occurs giving rise to foul smelling stools.I hope that helps.

Eventually gave her some vhildrens tylenol. How to stop the pain, help the burp vome out?","Doctor":"Thanks for posting your query at HealthCareMagic. Since you have mentioned, let me mention that your son has lactose intolerance and not milk allergy which are two different ailments. As of now, Lactase enzyme supplements will be able to provide him relief. You may also give him some drotin (drotaverine) tablets to relieve the cramps.The degree of intolerance differs with each person. The best way to assess your tolerance is first to get all lactose out of your system by avoiding all lactose-containing foods for three to four weeks. Then start with very small quantities of milk or cheese. Monitor your symptoms to see how much or how little dairy food you can handle without experiencing discomfort. Once you know your limits, management becomes a little easier.Cocoa powder. Studies indicate that cocoa powder and sugar, or chocolate powders, may help the body digest lactose by slowing the rate at which the stomach empties. The slower the emptying process, the less lactose that enters your system at once. That means fewer symptoms. The calcium in chocolate milk is just as well absorbed as that in regular milk, and you may tolerate flavored milk better than plain.Also note, nondairy foods that contain calcium, include:* Broccoli, okra, kale, collards, and turnip greens.* Canned sardines, tuna, and salmon.* Calcium-fortified juices and cereals.* Calcium-fortified soy products such as soy milk, tofu, and soybeans.* Almonds.I hope that helps.

But let me mention that it is not likely to be much effective.A stool softener, also known as a laxative, may be given to clear the bowels. These are safe in children, but should be used under the supervision of your pediatrician. Please do not use purgatives. A high-fiber diet with plenty of fluids needs to be given. This means loading your child’s plate with plenty of fresh fruits and vegetables, high-fiber cereals, whole grain breads (look for at least 3-5 grams of fiber per serving), and a variety of beans and other legumes, like chickpeas and lentils.You would also need your doctor to look into any underlying cause that may be there.

And also has been making a hiccup sound and twitching in his sleep. Please help me and my son Matthew","Doctor":"Thanks for posting your query at HealthCareMagic. Clear discharge from his eyes is not a cause of concern. The opening of his nasolacrimal duct might have not yet developed and a certain type of simple massage at the angle of eye and nose over a period of time will give him relief. For his acid reflux continue Zantac. But chances are that he is not being burped properly after feeds. Make sure that the child is placed in erect posture, possibly on lap, for about 20 minutes after each feed. In any case, keep his head end raised after feeds. Probably with such interventions his reflux would subside. The blister over his foot is probably unrelated. Apply emolients or moisturisers over the are.

I fell into a deep dark depression during this time and would sleep all day to find relief from the pain and anguish that came along with my heartbreak. After my son was born, I continued to sleep every chance that I got and would wrap my baby up in a blanket and position my son the same way. Without realizing it, my son ended up with plagiocephaly. By the time it was called to my attention, it was too late for my son. The sutures in his skull had already closed. I was informed this evening, while doing homework with my children, that my nephew was teasing my son for having a dent in his head. The comment regarding my sons head brought tears to my eyes. I haven’t been able to forgive myself and I don’t think I ever will. My son is currently 6 yrs old and will turn 7 this October. I have many concerns for my son. My son has never had a hair cut in his entire life. I braid his hair down in efforts to try to disguise the deformity located on the right side of his head. We are African-American and one day, after my son graduates from college, he will need to be appropriate to interview for jobs. No one will want to hire my son with braids in his hair. He needs to be able to cut his hair and wear suits proudly. Also, both his grandfather and father are bald. What happens to my son if his hair pattern follows in that same direction? When my son was born, his head shape was absolutely perfect. I want my son to be able to fit in with society and not be ashamed or judged on his deformity. My son is an innocent child and if there were anyway I could take his place I would. Is there anyway that an implant can be created for my son with the help of 3d imaging? Thank you for all of your help from a desperate and guilt felt mom.","Doctor":"Thanks for posting your query at HealthCareMagic. Firstly, I would ask you to stop blaming yourself and having so much guilt. There are so many children with plagiocephaly who grow up to merge with the population just as their peers. At 6 years of age, his head has not yet reached an adult size and so there is more time for growth. Even in case of deformities, one has to know that they are a part of his ownself. Unless one can accept them boldy and with a positive attitude, life would become bothersome. Eveybody has blemishes in some way or other. Even your nephew will have some weak point. If someone tries to hide them, they rather become more apparent.When the braids are opened up, the hair is likely to grow normally as the hair growth is determined primarily by genetics. You may also like to visit a cosmetologist who will be able to say what hair style or what interventions would be best for your child.Remember that if you suffer from guilt, your son would not be able to grow a firm character. So stay relaxed and positive.I hope that helps. Feel free to revert back in case of further queries."},{"Patient":"my 6 month have a bad cough-passed on by his 4 year old brother.

She is 4. She lived in Georgia. She is with my(aunt) and her dad. The home she came from was believed tonot be healthy in many meanings. My 11 yr old said that my niece said she itched a lot down in her groin area and she saw a rash since she was helping her get her night time pull-ups on and she told me she put some calamine lotion on it and a bandaid and showed me the band aid and let me know in a non concerned manner. Tonight I saw the clump of about 20 tiny fluid filled blisters and then it lightly trailed out in a slight trail in pubic(high) area to the other groin side. But definitely not in clumps. But the blisters are definitely fluid filled and given the history of this child... Does it seem reasonable or sound like herpes? It s not red or swollen. Just the blisters. And they itch and hurt. Or is there another disorder or rash like poison oak that sounds like this? It s just not red. So it s throwing me off a bit.","Doctor":"Thank for query.

Doctor said that should avoid mangos etc...","Doctor":"Thanks for putting up your query at HealthCareMagic. Your little kid is suffering from common cold. In most of the cases this is due to a viral cause rather than bacterial. In case of viral infections antibiotics are ineffective and hence may provide no relief as in your case. But when you have started antibiotics, it is preferrable to continue them for the prescribed 5 days to avoid development of antibiotic resistance. You need not go to a new doctor. Rather give the baby steam inhalation. Sit with the baby in your lap and put the source of steam before you. The air that the baby breathes in would automatically contain steam and the baby will breathe that in. The water vapour or steam will help in diluting the cough and provide relief. In a hospital setup, nebulisation could be given instead.What you eat affects the quality of milk that you produce. Thus what you eat is what goes to the baby. Although in Ayurvedic medicine it is suggested not to take mangoes during cold, no evidence in favour of it has been demonstrated and there is no justification for the same as per modern medicine. So I would not stop you from taking mangoes.I hope that helps.

Her pedia gave me already antibiotic Cefaclor and its her 3rd day taking med. im wondring, how will i know if the med is curing my baby's UTI? what other causes of uti aside from hygiene? Thanks!","Doctor":"Thanks for putting up your query at HealthCareMagic. I understand the cause of your concern. Our urinary tract under normal circumstances contains certain bacteria and there is nothing unusual about it. When this number increases beyond a certain limit, the situation is known as urinary tract infection (UTI) and although the body sends its white blood cells to fight, they cannot do so adequately. The dead white blood cells are known as pus cells, what has been detected in urine. If the urine is cultured, the sensitivity of these bacteria to antibiotics can be determined. If the bacteria are sensitive to the antibiotic that has been prescribed, the fever comes down. It may take a few days time and there is nothing to worry. If the fever comes down, you can assume that the antibiotics are working and the UTI is getting cured.Since the bacteria that cause UTI are already present in the urinary tract, all you have to do is to keep their number in check and this can be done by maintaining proper hygeine.I hope that helps.

Congratulations on having a baby. You have not mentioned how your baby was born i.e. whether by normal delivery or by caesarean section. If he was delivered by normal delivery, may be that during the delivery some amount of blood was collected under the scalp, what we call scalp haematoma. It goes away on its own and is not a cause for worry. I do not know whether the homeopathic medicines have given any additional relief. The umbilical cord generally falls off in 7-15 days and initially may remain soft. Some antibiotic ointment like Neosporin may be used there. If the umbilicus or navel is indrawn, it is also normal and not a cause for worry.Coming to the case of your wife, she had to bear a lot of hardships during pregnancy as well as labour and delivery. It is natural for her to feel weak unless she gets adequate nutrition. She needs a healthy diet to help her body to recover. And she needs to eat for two people, not one. Through her milk, her baby gets what she eats. Vitamins are not going to do much good as they are required in very small amounts and the things she needs more are things like carbohydrates, proteins, iron and calcium.Breast milk is the healthiest food for a baby. If that can be procured, I would not suggest you to go for formula feeds like lactogen. Breast milk has advantages for the mother too.I hope that helps.

I would have also asked him to take Isabgol husk regularly at night at fibre rich food improves gut motility and thereby eases digestion. Avoid fast foods and fat rich food.

I understand the cause of your concern. Often the cause of such fevers is viral and the blood-work does not reveal any problems in such cases. I guess that you would have to wait for a few days before it subsides on its own. If it lasts more than 7-10 days, get a Widal test done which will help you rule out typhoid (An antibody test will diagnose faster).When you have excess air in your stomach, it usually comes out as a burp. Usually the burp will have a smell of the food that you ate, but sometimes it will come out smelling like rotten eggs which you call sulfur burbs. It could be due to a gastro intestinal infection which is likely to have show up in the blood tests that you have already done, had it been present.

It will not cause any side effect after treatment is over? With Thanks Jagadees","Doctor":"Thanks for putting up your query at HealthCareMagic. I understand the cause of your concern. Although not very common, it is possible for children of all ages to grow a few gray hairs of their own. One of the leading causes of gray hair in children is a genetically determined. But before I answer your question, let me mention that there are certain simple conditions like malnutrition, vitamin B deficiency or abnormal thyroid hormone levels in the body (either too low or too high) can also cause gray hair. These are correctable causes and need to be considered before you actually try to increase the melanin production.There are some health conditions that can cause gray hair in children. One such condition is alopecia areata, which causes patches of hair loss on the scalp and other parts of the body. As the hair grows back, it may be gray at first. Some children lack pigment cells in a patch of hair follicles at birth. Others lose hair color when the immune system accidentally destroys pigment cells in a localized area. Some forms of poliosis can be inherited. Poliosis may also be associated with certain skin disorders, such as vitiligo, and genetic disorders, such as Marfan's syndrome and Waardenburg's syndrome. Less commonly, gray hair may be associated with childhood disorders such as vitiligo (which also causes a decrease of pigment in the skin), tuberous sclerosis, neurofibromatosis and Waardenburg syndrome. These disorders run in families and have other symptoms such as seizures, tumors under the skin, and hearing loss. If you are concerned about any of these conditions, I encourage you to talk with your child's pediatrician.Protein rich foods like soya, lentils, sprouts, meats, liver, eggs along with biotin and selenium. Foods like carrots, salmon, sardines, nuts cauliflower induce good hair growth as well as prevent further premature greying. Green leafy vegetables, salads fruits are helpful too.Altris gel contains melitane a new compound launched to prevent premature greying. You can use it safely as it would not harm your son's hair.

Now there is still drainage and the skin around the belly button is discolored (a grey to purple color). I also noticed a purple discoloration to the top of his penis. It appears that the top of his penis touched his belly button and got silver nitrate on it. Should I be concerned?","Doctor":"Thanks for putting up your query at HealthCareMagic. I understand the cause of your concern. Silver nitrate is safe and if it touched the penis, there is no need to be concerned. But the cause of purple discolouration of the top the penis is not clear from the description that you have provided. I suggest that you consult your paediatrician about this. A discolored bellybutton, usually blue or purplish, is often caused by an umbilical hernia. But that is normal in newborns and you need not worry as the condition generally gets corrected on its own. Information about whether the baby was born preterm would have been helpful.I hope that helps.

I understand the cause of your concern but you have not mentioned the age of the child and that would have been important.The dietary changes for lactose intolerance should initially include the exclusion of those foods rich in lactose. If the symptoms resolve then small amounts of lactose containing foods may be reintroduced, and symptoms monitored. Most people will be able to determine their tolerance level for lactose. Very rarely people may be so sensitive that they will need to exclude foods with lower levels of lactose including biscuits, cakes and other processed foods. It is important to find a suitable replacement if important foods are excluded from the diet. The lactose content of dairy foods varies widely, as do the serving sizes consumed. Breast feeding need not be stopped unless the baby has severe problems with it. Being lactose intolerant is not the same as having milk allergy, which is a more serious problem affecting a much smaller portion of the population. Had I known the age of the child, I could have commented better but the following food can be given if age appropriate:* Spinach* Canned salmon or sardines with bones* Calcium-fortified orange juice* Raw broccoli* Canned white tuna* Calcium-fortified soy milk* Dark green leafy vegetables* AlmondsA guide to a healthy lactose free/low lactose eating planBreakfast:A bowl of high fibre cereal such as weetbix or porridge with fresh fruit and soy or low lactose milk (if tolerated ) and/or wholemeal or grain toast with milk free margarine e.g. Sundew and honey or vegemite. Tea or coffee with soy or low lactose milk.Lunch:Sandwiches made with wholemeal bread with lean beef, tinned fish such as salmon (include the bones for calcium) and salad. Milk free margarine if necessary. Tinned or fresh fruit. Water, tea, diluted juice or cappuccino made with soy milk.Main Meal:Water with lemon juice. Chicken and vegetable stir fry served with steamed rice. Fruit and Fruccio dairy free ice cream, or custard made on soy or low lactose milk.Snacks:Fresh fruit, crackers or microwaved pappadums with salsa, popcorn. Toasted fruit loaf with milk free margarine and. Water, juice, tea, coffee or hot chocolate made from cocoa and soy milk.I hope that helps.

Homecoming weight was 1.85kg Medical complications since birth: Had retinopathy of prematurity. Cleared by itself now. Was on ventilator for 1-2 days in beginning. Had mild apnea in earlier days of NICU. Medical complications after coming home: 1. Spit ups and vomiting: Almost 3-4 times in each feed, ranging from small quantity to almost whole of the feed. Few days and few feeds are better than others. Half of the times vomits even after 1-2 hours after the feed. Sometimes milk, sometimes curdled, sometimes coughy. Most of the time she coughs and takes out the whole of milk, feels like she aspirates. Sometimes with burp. Even when we lay her down after 2 hours of feed and pick her up, sometimes she coughs and then vomits. Sometimes I feel that milk comes back up to her mouth and then returns. 2. Burp and gas: She needs to burp atleast 3-4 times between feeds and that too multiple burps. Even after 2-3 hours of feed sometimes she needs to burp. She gets very uncomfortable and cries sometimes to burp. Even when she sleeps she gets uncomfortable and if we don’t pick her immediately, she vomits and if we pick her immediately she burps and sometimes spits up. 3. Gags: Gags and has vomitish expressions on her face even at empty stomach. 4. Weight gain: It was 4kg a month back and now it is 4.35. 5. Her sonography shows hypoechoic lesion in liver which pediatric ruled out as nothing major. But did once mention that medicines like perinorm are not good for it. Milestones achieved: Makes eye contact and makes sounds and smiles. Medicines administered: Where and when medicines feed remarks NICU 1. A to z : multi vitamin 2. Tonoferon: iron 3. Nutriright d3: d3 4. Vitcofol 5. Perinorm: metoclopramide 6. HMF 7. Simyl oil Was given pre-nan formula milk but mostly expressed breast milk. Was taking about 45 ml at the time of discharge Had no issues of vomiting or tolerating milk. Coming home Was stopped A to Z and simyl oil. perinorm for a week Was given pre-nan half and half expressed breast milk. Was taking 45-50 ml. Had no issues A week after coming home Was re started with perinorm and other medications continued. Also, ossopan D for calcium started. Was shifted to NAN1 Formula milk. Was given expressed breast milk3-4 feeds. Issues of vomiting started after the changes. Since then when more vomiting persisted, her ossopan d was discontinued within a week, and other medications stopped since 2.5 months now. Lot of medicine and formula changes have taken place since then only to notice brief improvement and after few weeks it gets worse. Medicine changes include, perinorm, ondem, domstal,motinorm,lanzol junior, omez. And formula isomil was tried too for a month. For a few weeks we saw improvement with isomil ( was on breast milk on half feeds) but weight gain was poor and then vomiting increased and got worse. Medication now: Lanzol junior 15mg (1/3 tab a day), Motinorm 0.3 ml thrice. Doctor has suggested ventorlin 1.5 ml thrice and wheat cereal to be mixed with milk, both of which have not been started yet. Condition improved for a few days with change but worse now. Is back on NAN1 and breast feed in only 1-2 feeds a day. Precautionary measures: We are keeping her in upright position (on shoulder) for 30 minutes after feed. Feeding her in upright position. Making her sleep on her back with mattress elevated at around 30 degrees. Questions: 1. What is her problem 2. Shall we try Enfamil AR or Similac spit up? Or some hypoallergic formula? Will it be good for her also considering she gags and aspirates and coughs even now? 3. Is gripe water helpful 4. Can we try giving her vegetable juice, pulses water or rice starch 5. If medications wont help, shall we stop them altogether. Side effects of these medicines? 6. Her feedings lasts for 45 mins to 1.5 hours because of her burps and gagging and being uncomfortable. We are feeding her anywhere from 2 ounce to 3 ounce every 2.5 -3 hourly (at night 4-5 hourly). When she used to feel good she easily used to take 4 ounce. She still looks hungry but we are too scared to feed her coz of overfeeding and vomiting. She even vomits if she is hungry and has just had an ounce of milk! What to do and how much to feed her 7. Her sonography shows hypoechoic lesion in liver which pediatric ruled out as nothing major. But did once mention that medicines like perinorm are not good for it. Is any of her medication harming her?","Doctor":"Thank you for asking query.Very nice and neat information.As per the narration given by you the baby seems to have either severe gastroesophageal reflux or any abnormality of oesophageal tract.I suggest you to get barium studies of upper intestinal tract done.Till then continue medications you are giving.Continue feeding with 50 to 60 ml once.Hope you find this helpful.Rate the above answer.RegardsDr rushikesh kute."},{"Patient":"Helo dctr.

As the kids grow their interest in food decreases and interest in play activities increases so that they eat small quantity and run away to play. As parents we need to be more patient and feed than less quantity but more aliquots per day.4. This age rather than the quantity of the food I suggest you concentrate more on the number of times you feed her and also make whatever you feed her calorie dense by adding good amount of ghee to it.5. I suggest you not to use appetite stimulants on long run as they may cause drowsiness.At her age interest in play increases and interest in food decreases. This is quite natural. If she is active and playing around you need not worry. This age rather than the quantity of the food I suggest you concentrate more on the number of times you feed her and also make whatever you feed him calorie dense by adding good amount of ghee to it.PLEASE DO NOT GIVE ANY SO CALLED APPETITE STIMULANTS AS THEY ARE NOT VERY SCIENTIFICALLY PROVEN AND THEY HAVE THE SIDE EFFECT OF EXCESSIVE DROWSINESS.Hope my answer was helpful for you.

He had been prescribed Flovent HFA 44 mcg(2 puffs twice daily until one week after the cough stops) and Children s Claritin in United States. I was not prescibed the spacer and was not aware of it and was not able to administer the inhaler properly. I came to India for summer break and consulted with a Pediatric who presribed Laveta M. My son s cough was reduced but still not completely gone. Another Pediatrician precribed him with Levolin Inhaler(he is now on 2 puffs twice daily), Allegra syrup(5 ml twice daily) and Montair Granules(once) for 15 days. I have been giving the above inhaler and allergy medications for more than 15 days since he is been having slight cold symptoms of nasal congestion and he coughed more today.

For cold you can use anti-allergics like cetirizine and for nose block, saline nasal decongestants will do. Paracetamol can be given in the dose of 15mg/kg/dose every 4-6th hourly, that too only if fever is more than 100F. I suggest not using combination medicines for fever, especially with Paracetamol.For cold you can use Cetrizine at 0.25mg/kg/dose every 12 hourly for 3 days.For nasal block, plain saline nasal drops will do, every 4-6th hourly to relive nasal congestion.Hope my answer was helpful for you.

Such an infection generally has an allergic component associated alongwith, for which anti-allergics and cough syrups are given. T-minic contains Phenylephrine which is given at 0.2 mg/kg/dose 3 or 4 times a day. The amount in ml would depend upon the formulation of the syrup (medicine content in mg/ml).

Apart from measles there are a number of viral infections that cause fever with rashes (viral exanthem). They can also be caused by certain bacteria. I am not giving you a list of the probable conditions as they would only make you more confused. There is a definite characteristic of each of these infections and definitely your paediatrician would know what to look for. It is no use panicking. It could also be a not-so-worrysome simple condition wherein not much has to be feared. On the other hand, many of the conditions are contagious so upto the point of time that your paediatrician suggests, I would insist on keeping the child isolated from the others."},{"Patient":"My great grand baby was born ten weeks early, he has had a large belly, but lately it s gotten larger. The doctor at Cook s has done barium enema and said maybe Hersh Spurger (spelling) , Today his little belly is larger, won t eat and fussy.

I am sorry to hear that your great grandbaby is not doing quite well. Probably your doctor seems to have a diagnosis of Hirschsprung's (pronounced: HIRSH-sproongz) disease. This is a condition that is present at birth (congenital) where there are missing nerve cells in the muscles of part or all of the baby's of the large intestine (colon) thereby causing problems with passing stool. A newborn who has Hirschsprung's disease is usually unable to have a bowel movement in the first days after birth. This often requires surgical intervention. However, the diagnosis needs to be confirmed first. There are a number of conditions that cause instestinal obstruction in a newborn and the factors need to be looked into. Some portion of the gut could have not developed at all. Simpler things like meconium plug or meconium ileus wherein the stool of the newborn gets solidified thus preventing the bowel movement, must have already been ruled out by now. I am sure that the doctors are doing their best. The tube that has been inserted into the stomach is indeed meant for decompression of the stomach. The antibiotics are meant to prevent some infection that may arise or are already likely to be present."},{"Patient":"My 6 year old daughter is complaining of her stomach and mainly her left side hurting.

It doesn t seem to be excruciating but just enough to bother her. This wouldn t be appendicitis since it s one the left side, could it?","Doctor":"Thanks for putting up your query at HealtcareMagic. I am sorry that your little daughter is not doing well. Children become whiney or lathergic when they are ill and especially if there is an excruciating pain somewhere in the body. See seems to be suffering from an infection in her bowels although some more information is needed to be certain about it. For example information on her bowel habits and whether she is regularly passing stool, is important. If she is not passing stool regularly, it could easily be due to impaction of stool in the large bowels which are located in the left of the abdomen. On the other hand, if she is having diarrhea, it could be due to amoebiais, a condition wherein certain microbes affect the large bowels. That could also account for the fever of 100.5°F. Appendicitis seems less likely if there is no pain in the lower right portion of the abdomen. I would suggest that you visit a doctor who would be able to actually press his hands against the child's abdomen and obtain more information. Other parts of the body like the chest also needs to be looked into for probable sources of infection."},{"Patient":"My one year old has been having a swollen testicle that comes along with pain. He also has a dimple like indentation right on top of where his bladder sits but on the outside that seems to bother him as well. It s been growing deeper and bigger. He had an ultrasound and it showed swollen testicle but came back inconclusive on the dimple indentation. What can it be? Dr wants to run more test","Doctor":"Thanks for putting up your query at HealthCareMagic. I am sorry to hear that your 1 year old son has a swollen testicle. However, there are a few more things that I would have liked to know. Assuming that the swelling is actually affecting the testicle/testis and not any other structure in the scrotal sac, the first thing I would like to know is whether it was present since birth or whether it has developed recently. The second thing is whether it is associated with any redness and pain when touched. The third thing that I would like to ask is whether there is fever or any other symptoms present alongwith.Now let me come to the possibilities one by one. If it is present since birth (congenital), it could be some sort of tumor or even a simple hydrocele. That however has less possibilities of being associated with pain. If however, redness or pain is present, a condition called torsion of testis may be present wherein the blood supply to a testis is disrupted. The pain and redness could also arise when there is inflammation of the duct of the testis known as the epididymis with or without affecting the testis, a condition called epididymo-orchitis. This could also be caused due to an urinary tract infection or a viral infection like mumps. This might be associated with fever. In some conditions an abscess or a collection of pus might also develop.I think that I have been able to give you an overall idea but if you get back with more details, I could perhaps be more precise. In light of the things I have told you, you might also like a briefing from your doctor on the possibilities he is considering."},{"Patient":"hello doctor i want to know am 40 year old last month i was suffering by penkriya attack but that was lipase was238 after hospitalized now i am ok every thing is in normal i want to know can i drink liquir cos before i use to take every day but only 100ml scotch[powerent2000@yahoo.co.in]","Doctor":"Hi! welcome to healthcaremagic.com.Drinking anytime now is going to be dangerous since already previously lipase had risen and pancreas is damaged .Any further insult to pancreas(drinking) would be very bad for your health.Take care."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I ve given my baby with high fever, appr. 15ml of crocin drops in 24 hours as I read the dosage info on the bottle wrongly. He is 11 months old and 11 kgs.... m sure it is overdose...as of now he seems ok but please tell me the signs I ve to look for and also let me know if he should be admitted in the hospital immediately.","Doctor":"I am glad that you have put your query on HealthCareMagic. I understand your concern about your child. The standard dose of crocin, which is the brandname of paracetamol, is 15 mg/kg/dose. Paracetamol is a very safe drug. The dose of paracetamol in crocin drops is 100 mg/ml and comes in 15 ml bottles. On the other hand crocin syrup/suspension is 120 mg/ml and comes in 60 ml bottles. That means for for your baby of 11 kg, the appropriate dose would have been 165 mg which is present in 1.65 ml of crocin drops or about 7.5 ml of crocin syrup. Please check whether you have used crocin syrup or drops. If you had used the syrup, I do not think there is much to be worried. But in case you have used the crocin DROPS and consumed the entire bottle of 15ml, I think that instead of trying to assess on your own, it would be advisible to take the child to a hospital with a  paediatric setup wherein they would be able to assess the condition better.If paracetamol overdose occurs, initially have nonspecific complaints such as vague abdominal pain and nausea. With progressive disease, signs of liver failure may develop; these include low blood sugar, low blood pH, easy bleeding, and hepatic encephalopathy. Some will spontaneously resolve, although untreated cases may result in death. So after confirming whether you have used crocin drops or suspension, i.e. if there is indeed an overdose, take the child to a hospital as urgent attention might be required."},{"Patient":"Hi my son is 1year 9months he has eczema. When he had eczema it wasn t that much he had it only on he s hands and leg. The older he s getting its getting really worse he s skin is gone so bad its red and most of he s eczema looks bruised. I don t know what to do I tried creams steroids the doctors keep on giving him steroids but its not helping. At the moment I m giving him bath with neem leaves n putting neem oil on. Does neem help with eczema??","Doctor":"Thanks for putting up your query on HealthCareMagic. I am sorry that your son has eczema which in medical terms is known as atopic dermatitis. It is not dangerous, non-contagious but most types cause red, swollen and itchy skin. Factors that can cause eczema include other diseases, irritating substances, allergies and the child's genetic makeup. Speaking in simpler terms, in eczema the immune system gets hyperactive and attacks the skin in an apprehension that some agents (allergens) like dust might be harmful even though they are not. In the process, the skin gets damaged and looks bruised. The steroids decrease such immune reactions and tend to control eczema.Daily moisturizing is the basis of any eczema treatment, and even while eczema is under control it's important to continue the moisturizing regime to prevent future flare ups. Nothing is as important as keeping the skin hydrated. It is the most important step in treating eczema with neem or otherwise.Neem based products have been shown to be very effective in treating eczema (as in, relieving the symptoms), but they don't cure eczema. External use of neem based moisturizers helps to prevent dryness of the skin. Similar effects can be achieved using ones containing agents like aloe vera. Neem also has anti-inflammatory effects, and can reduce the redness and irritation. It is also believed to have antibacterial actions.I hope that this knowledge would be more helpful in dealing with your problem. Feel free to put your queries and I would be happy to clarify further."},{"Patient":"Hi, My son is 21 months old and has had a dry hacking cough for several weeks - months... however, whenever we go to the doctor, she says his lungs sound fine. He always seems congested, so I m always asking the doctor at his checkups... Usually the coughing is worse at night, but it strikes in the day, too. I m just trying to figure out at what point do I push this with the doctor or do I ride it out? If it s something like allergies, is there really anything we can do about it?","Doctor":"Thanks for putting up your query on HealthCareMagic. I am sorry that your 21 month old son is suffering from cough. Cough or coryza in medical terms is basically an allergic reaction that is triggered by agents like dust or viruses like respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) or certain other viruses that are always around us. Our respiratory secretions have something called sol-gel ratio and normally get mobilised upward on its own but when this ratio gets distubed and more gel-like, we call is cough and it is no longer able to be moved up spontaneously and needs to be coughed out. When it is even drier, we refer to it as dry cough. The solution would be in making it more liquid and less gel like. This can be easily done by two things. One is to avoid anything that you might feel him to be allergic to. Secondly, make the child drink more water. Thirdly, give him steam inhalation which is basically water in the vapour form that can go deep inside the lungs and liquify the gel-like cough. Doing this on regular basis two or three times a day is supposed to give him relief. In a process called nebulisation done in a hospital to relieve such patients, a similar thing is done with saline water with some medicines called bronchodilators. I cannot evaluate the requirement of bronchodilators without actually listening to his chest where I would have also been able to look for stridor or wheezing. Your paediatrician may be able to do that. Since you say that the chest seems clear to the doctor whom you have consulted, I assume it not to be some bacterial infection, croup, tuberculosis or whooping cough but lets not make things seem more complicated for you."},{"Patient":"my 4 month old son unites very frequently. Like 7 to 8 times between feeds (2 hrly). this is not always and on an average its 4 times btw feeds.He looks perfectly fine, feeding fine, passes motion once in 4 days. though recently the quantitiy seems little less. his weith is on lower side, birth weight 2.7 and was 4.2 at 3 months.","Doctor":"Thanks for expressing your concern on HealthCareMagic. Your 4 month old son seems to be doing fine and I do not see a cause of concern. The frequency of passing urine indicates whether the child is getting adequate feeds. So, frequent passage of urine is a good sign and not a cause of concern. In this context, I assume that the baby is breast fed and does not receive any other formula feed or water. If that is not the case, I would insist on placing the preference on breast milk if there is a scope. The child does not need to be given water anyway. Passage of stool may be taken to be normal irrespective of whether it occurs 10 times a day or once every 10 days.Periodically the weight needs to be measured and plotted on a chart to see whether the growth is adequate. There is no cause to be concerned if the paediatrician tells you that although the weight is on a lower centile it is growing at appropriate rate."},{"Patient":"good morning sir, i have 6 months baby. he cannot drink milk and also weight less. i consult one doctor he given medicine CYP - L. I continue my douse to my baby but my baby continuously sleeping after giving that medicine. please give me some suggestions to over come this problem","Doctor":"I am glad that you have put up your query at HealthCareMagic. Nutrition in an infant plays an important role in growth. 6 mnonths of age is appropriate for weaning or introduction of semi-solids into the diet alongside mother's breast milk. In case you have not yet done it, I would insist addition of cereals to the diet. Certain babies have lactose intolerance and cannot digest milk and diarrhea, flatulence (passing gas), and abdominal pain occur. Abdominal bloating, abdominal distention, and nausea also may occur. The information that you have provided is inadequate to make the diagnosis certain. Lactose intolerance can be diagnosed by eliminating lactose from the diet, milk challenge, breath test, blood glucose test, stool acidity test, and intestinal biopsy. Avoidance of milk and milk-containing products can lead to a dietary deficiency of calcium and vitamin D that, in turn, can lead to bone disease (osteoporosis). Zerolac is a milk formulation containing no lactose and may be tried.If I had a patient like your baby, I would have not suggested Cyp-L which contains a drug called cyproheptadine which is supposed to act as appetite stimulant. But it is not proven to be effective and has a sedative action. I would suggest you to consult some pediatrician before deciding on the intervention."},{"Patient":"Hi Doc, My son is 02 years old and for couple of days his poo color has changed. After normal poo he is again going poo is very small quantity with greenish color and sticky. Though this is happening 02 to 03 times in a day. He is eating good and is having both cow milk and mother s milk.","Doctor":"I am glad that you have put up your query at HealthCareMagic. I understand your cause of concern. But I would like to reassure you since greenish stools are often normal. Greenish stools may occur when food might be moving through the large intestine too quickly, such as due to diarrhea. As a result, bile doesn't have time to break down completely. Green stool can also be caused by taking iron supplements or eating certain foods such as green leafy vegetables, green food coloring, such as in flavored drink mixes or ice pops. Foods with dark purple coloring, such as Kool-Aid, popsicles, and gelatin (Jell-O), can also result in greenish or green stools.In case you wish to be even more certain, I insist that you consult a pediatrician."},{"Patient":"hello doctor i am breastfeeding mother i am suffering from piles,doctor give me medicine for 2 months course ,i started the medicine only one dose but my baby became in fever then i have stop my medicine, now after 1 week my baby also infected what should i do when she pass her stools with blood green color stools ,should i have to feed her or not?","Doctor":"I am glad that you have put up your query at HealthCareMagic. Piles or haemorrhoids is a condition wherein the veins in the rectum get engorged due to a backflow of blood from the liver which is responsible for processing and detoxifying the food that we eat and digest. It can also be caused due to constipation which causes abrasions in the rectum causing it to bleed. The piles gets relief on using stool softners like isabgol husk or lactulose syrup. Relief is also obtained by Sitz bath wherein you have to sit with the anal opening dipped in water so warm that the skin can take.Unless there are issues with improper hygeine causing microbes to be passed on to the baby, there is no direct relation of piles with the baby breast feeding. You can continue breast feeding the baby and need not be concerned."},{"Patient":"Hi I have my doughter 10 months and the docctor thins that she may have gratifications disorders.he told me that she should do a EEG.I would like to know if the situation is grave and if the EEG isnt normal is it permanent or provizorial.SHOULD I BE WORRIED SO MUCCH OR IS SOMETHING THAT WILL DISAPIAR WITH THE TIME.pLEASE HELP ME!","Doctor":"Thank you for asking question on Health Care Magic. You need not worry. Gratification disorder or infantile masturbation  is a form of masturbatory behavior that has often been mistaken for epilepsy. Most pediatricians accept it to be normal. Your doctor has asked her to undergo an EEG simply to rule out epilepsy and be certain that there is nothing worth worrying.Hope this answer will serve your purpose.Please feel free to ask any more queries if required."},{"Patient":"My son is 6 months old and he is suffering for cold since 10 to 12 days and he is coughing very often.

The medicine he is taking is alright ?","Doctor":"Thank you for asking question on Health Care Magic. Your son seems to have a respiratory tract infection. It is generally caused by a virus but at times there are secondary bacterial infections present alongside. Antibiotics can relieve a bacterial infection but not a viral one.

You have not indicated what sort of paraffin the child has taken - whether it is soft paraffin, liquid paraffin or kerosene. Paraffin is poorly absorbed by the gastrointestinal tract but there is often aspiration into the respiratory tract especially if the child vomits. This causes pneumonitis which may be so severe as to cause pulmonary oedema and hypoxaemia. Such features usually occur within hours but may be seen a day or so after ingestion when the child becomes breathless and feverish up to 40ºC. The signs of pneumonitis also include cough, tachypnoea and tachycardia, cyanosis, pulmonary crepitations and rhonchi. However a chest X-ray often shows pulmonary changes (non-segmental consolidation or collapse, especially on the right side and lower lobes) even without pulmonary physical signs. Had I been able to see the Chest X-Ray, I would have been able to comment better. I am sure that you may tally the case of your baby with the details I have provided, and arrive at a conclusion yourself. If he has not been vomiting, and if your doctor says that the chest is clear, probably it is just a case of common cold.I hope that answers your query. Feel free to get back with the details and I would try to help you further."},{"Patient":"Hi! The right side near my belly button is a little bigger than my left. It is not noticeable to other people since they can t see it from the top like i could. but i could definitely see the difference. Also a little below my rib cage, the left side is bigger than the right. I ve searched on the internet the possible causes for this but everything seems to lead to pregnancy . I can t be. Since I have been having my periods (in fact, I just had it last week), and I had an ultrasound yesterday, which also said that I was not. Pregnancy test also said negative. Sometimes I also have pains that come and go in those areas which i said were bigger. Also, sometimes my back hurts.","Doctor":"Hello There.. Welcome to healthcare magic forum.. You said you have got a ultrasound done??Did it show anything abnormal?? I think if there were any pathology than ultrasound would be able to pick it up.. I would suggest you to consult a surgeon who would be able to guide you properly. Hope this helps.. Take care.."},{"Patient":"My 4 years old Son is suffering from Cough and Cold but no Fever... He also complaint about ear pain... for Ear pain I am giving him one Homeopathic ear drop... can you pls suggest a generic medicine for cough and cold..? He is throwing up little mucus while coughing and also have blocked nose.","Doctor":"Thanks for putting your query up at HealthCareMagic. I understand your concerns for your 4 year old son. Many children have a natural tendency to suffer from cough and cold. Cold depresses our immunity and in the meanwhile certain viruses that are always around, do the harm. It also has an allergic component wherein non-harmful agents like dust are treated by the body with apprehension and results in cough. The tonsils which are located at the back of the neck, often become enlarged and play an important role in cough and cold. The tonsils regress with age and I guess you would have to wait till then when the tendency to catch cold would automaically come down. There is an internal connection between the throat and ear and hence during cold we often feel a pain in the ears. But that is probably not a cause for concern. There is no medicine that can change the genetic make up of a person. I insist that you try to make your child gurgle with lukewarm water and if required give him some antiallergics after consulting your doctor.I hope that answers your query. Feel free to revert back in case of further queries."},{"Patient":"2 of my grandchildren are running low grade fever and have blisters in their mouth and throat with very swollen lips..it started with one child and the second one the next day.We are afraid it might be contagious as well. I Don t know if I have given you enough information. Also we know they did not eat anything unusual.","Doctor":"Thanks for expressing your concern on HealthCareMagic. There are a number of viral infections that give rise to fevers with rashes, although certain other infections also be causative. The nature of rash can distinguish between them. Based on the information that you have provided, it could be herpes or chicken pox but the information that you have provided is not enough. It would have been best if I could have a direct look but that is not possible. I suggest that you consult a doctor. The infection could be contagious and so I would advise isolation upto the point of time when you consult a doctor. He would also be able to tell you whether it is a simple case of vitamin B deficiency.I hope that answers your query.

Is this normal for a newborn?","Doctor":"Thanks for expressing your query at HealthCareMagic. I understand your concern for your newborn grand-niece. A red ring around the iris is not normal finding and may indicate an inflammation of the eye. It could either be due to an infection (less likely) or due to some trauma at birth (there is an entity called subconjunctival haemorrhage which gets corrected on its own). If there is no watering or pus formation, probably it is not a cause of concern. But definitely consult your paediatrician/neonatologist to be certain about it.I hope that answers your query.

He is also developmental delay, Autistic and has cardiac mumours. My question is all the research that I have done tonight shows me that it all boils down to the kidneys. what diet should I have him on to maintain them in Great health and can he play in sports without stressing out the body.","Doctor":"Thanks Lisa for putting up your query at HealthCareMagic. I am sorry that your 3 year old son is suffering from Frasier syndrome. It is a rare disease with improper development (dysplasia), underdevelopment (hypoplasia), or absence of one or both kidneys (unilateral or bilateral renal agenesis) caused due to a genetic defect. There are certain other associated abnormalities and I am not going into the details. Unless I can come to know the exact nature of kidney defect your child has, it is difficult to comment on the diet. An ultrasonography would make things clearer. That would also indicate whether the livers are affected as well. That too would play a role in determining the diet. It would also vary with the presence or absence of protein in urine which would indicate a defect at microscopic level. Please get back to me with the details and I would try to help you further."},{"Patient":"Hi, my 4yrs old has been diagnosed to have an acute sinus after a continuous experience of on-and-off cough, running nose and sometimes fever for months. I thought it was a regular flu until i feel that it is too often. The doctor said it was originally caused by an allergy, i haven t check it yet. So now, the doctor gave my kid 2 bottle of abbotic clarithromycin 3/4 tbsp twice a day. Is it safe? He also suggest to get him vaporized and shine with a micro wave or something daily for about 2 weeks. Is it the way to cure sinus? Thank you. Cheers, Angel","Doctor":"Thanks for putting up your query at HealthCareMagic. I understand your concern for your 4 year child. Do not worry about the antibiotic clarithromycin. It is safe and effective. Unfortunately, sinuses are air pockets deep inside our face and their blood supply is poor and often the antibiotics cannot reach there to make an effect. So, at times no antibiotic is successful in providing good relief and hence it is difficult to cure sinusitis. But generally the ailment comes down with age. I guess that you have to be a bit patient and wait to see if they give your son relief. Steam inhalation is a very effective method where water vapour goes deep inside and dilutes the cough and eases the situation.I hope that helps.

I m 23 with a 3 yr old daughter. so basically everything is new to me about motherhood. Well I live in a small town and I have been taking my daughter to all these little Dr s office s for about 6 months and none of them seem to know anything wrong with my daughter situation. I m really concerned for my daughter s health and I am wanting to know if this is a big health issue or something that s normal and will blow over. She is 3 and has been potty trained since the age of 2. Just recently for about a few months now, she has been constantly urinating on her self. Before and after she has gone to the bathroom. Sometimes she does not even notice she has had an accident. she has about 4 to 5 accidents a day.! Just this week we had an incident where she did not make it but this time. Her urine smell so strong, it burned my nose I couldn t bear the smell. I asked if it hurts and she replies with a no.? Then I check her vaginal area to see if anything is wrong. The only thing I noticed, that it is really RED but no rash. I really need help to see what I should do. I don t want to put it off any longer if it is something very serious. I need help or answers.

Your result is perfectly alright and you have nothing to worry about. Renal cortical cysts are incidental findings on US and have no significance, unless they are of rapid growing type.Heteroechoic(inhomogeneous)cyst and haemorrhagic cyst, I think are referring to the same cyst. Haemorrhage in the corpus luteal cyst is occasionally seen after ovulation and it subsides of it's own within 3 months and does not require any treatment.It could of course be Chocolate (endometriotic) cyst, in which case it can cause pain during menstruation, and it needs treatment."},{"Patient":"Hi there.

Usually rather than fever, what is more important is the activity of the child, in between 2 fever episodes on the same day.

She feels better after laying down for awhile and napping, or with eating crackers. She normally runs between 97.6 and 98.4 but she has been running in the 99's. She doesn't nap but has been sleeping for hours every day after I pick her up from the school and still going to bed at 8p. It doesn't make it better or worse when she eats, or eats certain types of foods. She has had allergy tests done and only showed an allergy to dust not even pollens or pet dander, I can not find a trigger to when it gets worse and when it gets better, however the laying down and crackers do work.  The 3 ER visits, and 3 trips to the Dr's has given us know answers. A CT, Ultrasound, urine and blood panels done, all with normal results. She is going to school but they then call to pick her up because she is not doing well. She has made a total of 5 whole days in the last 3 weeks and only because she says she tries to ignore the pain as much as she can. No emotional issues, no bullying, she loves school and wants to be there. Her last ER visit the Dr prescribed her 1/2 tsp every 8hrs of Donnatal Elixer to take to see if it helped. Sometimes it helps sometimes it doesn't. However I am concerned with giving it to her as I read the info that says in children use extreme caution.

I was run through the ringer, even after being admitted to the hospital after a month of this, they still ran a weeks worth of tests before deciding to go in and do exploratory surgery. They said I had appendicitis, in fact, they said it had ruptured and resealed itself, and pathology of it said the appendix was completely obliterated. Is there anyway the same thing can being going on with my daughter? Would the Donnatal mask the symptoms of Appendicitis? Is that even safe for her to take? Is there other ways besides surgery I could try to eliminate it being appendicitis or even treating it, preferably naturally with out use of pharmaceutical medicines. What other things could it be, I know abdominal pain is associated with so many different health problems.

For this oil massage and lotions like Oilatum will help. Regarding cure options - eczema is a sort of allergy...allergies can only be controlled and can never be cured. But usually kids grow out of it...that is as the age progresses, they become better starting from 6 months. This doesn't seem to be related to fever.Hope my answer was helpful for you.

She also has a red rash. Now 11 hours later she is hooked up with monitors etc but no other episode has occurred? She is a breast fed baby.","Doctor":"The condition of greatest concern is infection affecting the brain. The coughing and foaming can occur as the result of a seizure that occurs because of the infection.  Especially at that age, it is critical that the child be thoroughly evaluated and treated immediately, so it's very good she's in the hospital.

Statistics show that if a child hits her head but never loses consciousness, never throws up, cries right away or returns to play right away, and doesn't seem sleepy or unusually 'out of it' after a head bump, then the chances of a serious injury being present are extremely low.  Most likely the nose/mouth got hit somehow on the way down or right when she hit, and that lead to the bleed.  If it stopped right away, it is usually no cause for alarm.  Again, if anything at all seems off, it is always right to have the doctor take a look."},{"Patient":"Hi, my daughter is 8 years old.

Just now she said if she bends her pinky finger it sends numbness up her arm. Any thoughts on what it could be?","Doctor":"Strong coughing can lead to muscle spasm and pinching of nerves.  It is possible that the coughing lead to a pinched nerve which shows itself when the finger is moved. This is likely indirectly related to the coughing and low grade fever.  Those are likely to be an infection and a visit to the doctor is indicated."},{"Patient":"my 1 yr old daughter has a quarter size raised red bump with a large white center on her upper leg that is progressively getting larger over the past 2 days. she got her 1yr immunizations a week ago i dont know if its related. she also had multiple red bumps on her back and belly for 2 days a couple days before she got this bump. I was wondering if she needs to be evaluated by her pediatrician.","Doctor":"Sorry for the troubles!  She absolutely needs to be evaluated.  The bump on the leg sounds likely to be a local infection, and it may need to be drained or treated with antibiotics.  No way to evaluate well without someone seeing it.  If the bump is in the same spot as the shot was given, then there is likely a local infection that may have arisen.  The rash on the back and belly could be related to the vaccine, but it depends which shot(s) she got.  The varicella (chickenpox) vaccine may lead to a light rash.  That rash is not dangerous and just represents the body reacting to the shot, but the spot on the leg is not consistent with a normal vaccine reaction."},{"Patient":"This is Raju from patna and tel me sir if any patient facing stomach pain,and boating problem continue and Dr. says pls change kidney so pls suggest me whats openian abt this question...........

This condition is often associated with mineral deficiencies including especially iron deficiency.

A chest xray is the first place to start after a good physical exam and a careful history.  Often times there's a history of an injury that seemed minor at the time, but was followed by pain.

One doc has suggested to give either Calpol or Ibugesic Plus & the other one has suggested to give Crosin. Please guide..","Doctor":"Hi...Thank you for consulting in Health Care magic.Fever of few days without any localizing signs could as well a viral illness. Usually rather than fever, what is more important is the activity of the child, in between 2 fever episodes on the same day. If the kid is active and playing around when there is no fever, it is probably viral illness and it doesn't require antibiotics at all. Once viral fever comes it will there for 4-7 days. So do not worry about duration if the kid is active.Paracetamol can be given in the dose of 15mg/kg/dose every 4-6th hourly that too only if fever is more than 100F. I suggest not using combination medicines for fever, especially with Paracetamol. Hope my answer was helpful for you.  I am happy to help any time.

Once it starts it will take 5-7 days to completely get better.

I suggest you use zinc supplements (Z&D drops 1ml once daily for 14 days) & ORS (Each small packet mixed in 200ml of potable water and keep giving sip by sip) as hydration is very important and crucial part of treatment.

Yesterday I started to excrete orange fluid from skin when I was sweating what could this be????","Doctor":"Thank you for the question. Due to your liver  function disorder either by medicine or some primary disease, the the liver tests should be undertaken by a gastroenterologist.It seems iron level in body is high due to it so treatment for liver should begin after diagnosis of disorder.The treatment for iron overload is iron reduction therapy. A person's hemoglobin is key in the physician's decision of iron reduction therapy. If the patient's hemoglobin level is sufficient to tolerate blood removal (phlebotomy), the doctor can provide either an order for therapeutic phlebotomies or can recommend that a patient routinely donate blood. When a patient's hemoglobin is too low for phlebotomy, iron reduction  will likely require iron-chelation, which is the removal of iron using specific drugs. In some situations the physician may use a combination of these two therapies.You mau consult a clinical hematologist also as early as possible. pain in abdomen may be related to high iron content as well"},{"Patient":"So, I m feeling some tugging on my belly button and eveywhere I read it all says that it is because of pregnancy .

There are 5 doses of vaccine which need to be given over a period of a month. If the cat is under observation and is fine after 10 days then your child need not receive the remaining doses. But you cannot take a risk of observing the cat first and then starting treatment. Rabies is a highly deadly disease and once a person is affected with it, there is no definitive cure.         Hope that helps.Regards,Preeti"},{"Patient":"My 15 year old daughter went roller skating last night and she fell on her back.

So my doctor gave me gro9 to increase babies weight. Can it effect my child brains? l","Doctor":"Hello Sumita,                      Firstly a local homeopathy doctor cannot diagnose autism. There are special questionnaires and development tests which help in making the diagnosis. I advice you to consult a paediatrician for a detailed evaluation.                      Secondly, eating less or vomiting during pregnancy does not cause autism. You should stop worrying and you should definitely not blame yourself. But please first get the diagnosis confirmed.

The bleeding has stopped now but I am very concerned about what is was.","Doctor":"Hello,         Bleeding from nose is common in children so please do not worry. Your granddaughter must have injured her nose while picking at her nose leading to a clot formation. When she sneezed the clot could have dislodged leading to nose bleeding. This is the commonest cause of nose bleeding.         Consult an ENT specialist if she has frequent and recurrent episodes of nose bleeding.

The fever has come down but the cough is persisting. Now Zifi is an antibiotic used for bacterial infections. If your kid had a bacterial infection his fever would not have decreased without using an antibiotic. His cough could be due to other reasons - wheezing, postnatal drip. Please have him evaluated by a paediatrician who will examine his throat and chest and then give appropriate medicines. Even in the future I will advice that you should not use antibiotics without a doctors prescription.

He acknowledge the people around him but then does his own thing and really doesn t interact with people even we we call his name. Very rarely will he stop and look as us after we call him. I know he hears well because when were outside he ll listen to the birds signing or planes passing by and other little noises. I try to read him books and he s not interested. I have 2 older kids and they were not like this, I would talk to them and read to them and they would interact with me and people round them, but my toddler is not like that.. Should I be concern, as to maybe some type of down syntrum?","Doctor":"Hello,          You are right about being concerned for your son. He is not responding or interacting with people. The first thing you should do is to get a hearing test done. Hearing defects are a very common cause of this kind of behaviour. Even though you are sure he hears fine it is better to confirm it with hearing tests. Also did he achieve his other milestones on time - sitting, crawling, walking, holding things etc? Were there any complications during his newborn period?          If his hearing tests are normal, I would advice you to visit a paediatrician for a detailed evaluation. He needs to be assessed for development in other spheres, neurological examination and screened for other possible causes like autism. It is unlikely to be Downs Syndrome as these kids are very friendly and love social interaction.

Make sure to burp her after each feed. Some babies sleep off while breast feeding without satisfying their hunger and that is the reason why she wakes up later crying. For this problem when she is breast feeding and becomes sleepy gently rub her ears or flick her soles, this should wake her up and she will finish her feed. She should breast feed for 15 - 20 minutes at one sitting.         Try this and also get her weight checked to see if she is gaining weight adequately.          Hope this helps.Regards,Preeti"},{"Patient":"My 5 year old daughter is on her 4th day of Ritalin and clonidine prescribed by her paediatrician for ADHD...

This morning he had no injuries/accidents Prior to the bruise appearing. He also developed a rash on his face And neck almost as if blood had been sucked to Show through the skin, some in form of a line This isnt the first time,and they appear Very randomly..He has been seen by our local gp and in febuary and march senior doctors at princess margaret hospital . Child protection services are involved as a result of my sons father experiencing the first appearance of the bruising in his ear and laying allegations against my partner (father of my 4mnth old daughter) and myself.investigation took place and we had since been cleared of the allegations however child protection remained involved awaiting the (only) physical medical examination report . Since then the same rash and bruising has occured twice the last appearance only 3 days ago. I phoned child protection to advise of the bruise & rash appearing and the events/activities prior. Before this i phoned a health direct line and was advised to see a doctor within the next 4 hours, i did so. My gp had said after looking at both the rash & bruise it was suspicious. I know %100 my son has not been intentionally harmed whilst in my care And feel as though these doctors maybe looking past something medical. The rash is said to be *viral* my question is why does it just appear randomly? The hospital gave an antibiotic cream the time before this chlorsig and put the bruise/rash looking marks on chin and faint in ear down to bruising !! Its seems many other mums are experiencing same or similiar problems either with child p s or thier child showing same markings ?? Is there anything Else that could cause this??","Doctor":"Hello,          Your child is developing bruises without any injury or other symptoms. Repeated episodes of bruising cannot be a viral infection. Your child should be investigated for an underlying bleeding disorder. Have any blood tests been performed on the kid? Is there any family history of easy bleeding/ bruising?         Blood tests should be done to look at platelet count and coagulation factor deficiencies. I advice you to consult a paediatrician at the earliest. Hope that helps.

I would like to know a few more details before I can help you.          1) Why was the brain imaging done? What were your son's symptoms?           2) What was his birth history - was he a preterm baby? Did he cry immediately after birth?  Did he develop any complications after birth?            3) Is there any family history of fits or mental retardation?           The most common cause of encephalomalacia is some insult to the brain during delivery or soon after birth. If the child's birth was uneventful, then he needs to be worked up for an underlying metabolic/genetic disorder. There is no specific treatment for encephalomalacia. It is important to find out the cause because the treatment and the future development of your child can be predicted based on that.

At first I though it was my wisdom teeth crowding my mouth and making my jaw messed up but I’m not too sure anymore.","Doctor":"Hi,As per your complain it seems that pain on the side of face, locking of jaw and crackling sound can be due to the disturbances in the functioning of jaw joint known as Temporomandibular joint leading to TMJ/TMD.

My wisdom teeth have been swelling for the past 6 months and I have been taking antibiotics as prescribed by my dentist when they do, until I get them removed.  2 days ago, I've noticed that my finger/ nail bed is slightly infected and have been treating it with hot water baths and local antibiotic ointment. Yesterday, I have noticed that one of my wisdom teeth has begun swelling slightly as well.  Could they be related and should I be concerned?","Doctor":"Hi,No, the swelling of the finger nail and the wisdom tooth are not related and looks like a matter of coincidence. Swelling of the gum flap over wisdom tooth is a condition called pericoronitis and it is also due to infection, as well as swelling of the nail bed is due to infection , but one does not cause the other. For pericoronitis, you need to get checked by a Dentist and get antibiotics and also do warm saline gargles. Keep the area clean.

Can this be a result of the colitis and can it be treated.  My teeth are in great shape; have regular cleanings every 6 months, no cavities, etc.","Doctor":"Hi, As per your medical history the chances of periodontal disease increases in ulcerative colitis or pancolitis. But you said there is no visible dental problem. You need to visit a dentist to check if there is any marginal gingivitis that is making your breath bad. Also, upper GIT infections are also responsible for bad breath too. Make sure you don't keep your stomach empty but when your gastroenterologist advises you. Brush your teeth twice daily, using mouth freshener tooth paste. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further.
