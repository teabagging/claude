If it is injured, you have to apply a mild antibiotic cream ( with or without an oral Antibiotic, as per the guidance of the treating physician) for 5-7 days along with a total abstinence from all types of sexual activities for at least a week. Most of the individuals would not abstain from sex during treatment, that will delay the healing. it will heal nicely after a week. Nothing to worry. If the frenulum is unduly short, then the problem may recur and he may need a circumcision.Consult your physician,he/she will help you for an early healing. Wish you get well soon.

Thanks","Doctor":"Hi, .Masturbation is not injurious to health, but if you are worrying much or feeling guilty, then you will have lesser erection.You will not get erections as in your teens (frequency and hardness) hereafter. That is common for all. Don't bother about semen quality at present. It is quite ok.When you hug a girl or kiss her, you will regain your full erection. So nothing to get worry and get ready for marriage.As you are just 24 years, you need no drugs to help, provided your secondary sex characters (facial, axillary, pubic hair and if you have an early morning erection) are normal. Reduce your frequency of masturbation or have an abstinence for two weeks, you will regain your erections back. Have a great day. Dr S.Murugan"},{"Patient":"Foreskin tightening, pain in penis.

If it is so then you should immediately get up of your bed and do urination. This might help you.

Have a diet rich in fruits, vegetables, fish, nuts & honey.2. Avoid fast foods & lipid containing diet.3. Avoid smoking & alcohol.4. Keep away stress, think positive.5.

Yesterday morning (about 28 hours ago), I woke up with a morning erection, then decided to masturbate, even though my bladder must have been quite full, or at least half full. I usually masturbate after I have been to the toilet. The masturbation was quite short lasting, lying on my back, quite gentle masturbation, not rough, but at the ejaculation point, it didn t feel very good, a little painful during, which I haven t experienced before. I think it must have been related to the bladder not being emptied first. A few minutes later, I possibly made a second mistake, by urinating. It did seem like the urethrea was not ready for urine yet, took a while to succeed. Is it advised to wait a while before one urinates? Then during the day and night I have felt rather uncomfortable, mostly during the night, some pain/discomfort, which feels like it is located at the point where I usually feel if I need to urinate or not. Is this bladder pain? It helps a bit to urinate though. Could I have had some urine in the urethrea accidentally mixed together with the sperm during ejaculation? And is this harmful? I also wanna mention that the night before this I ate two oranges and quite much chocolate, which could make the urine more acid and harmful? I have not had sex for a long time, and never unprotected, so STD is out of the question. Now I am taking some ibuprofen and also some cranberry capsules. Not sure if I should see a doctor yet, since this is so fresh. I have a tendency to see doctor too often and worry about health matters. Could you please shed light to what might have happened? Does it sound like a temporary problem? Or will I next time also feel discomfort during ejaculation? I haven t tried masturbating again, since I think I should rest the system for some days.","Doctor":"DearWe understan your concernsI went through your details.I suggest you not to worry much. Because worrying can increase the problem dimension. As far as I can see, you do not have to go to any doctor because you donot have any problem at all. Masturbation with even full bladder is not harm ful, but there will be discomfort. Semen mixed with urine is normal and happens almost every time. Nothing wrong. Had oranges an chocolate. Nice. You should do that. But it has no effect on your semen or urine. I can see your problem.You are overly worried about your health, as you mentioned here. You should be careful about your health.

Even though chances of STD are remote because of your monogamous relationship with your wife, I being a doctor would advise you to under go tests for it after getting it physically examined by a dermatologist in your area to rule this out.The lumpish swelling could also be due to friction and the foreskin attachment with the penile shaft being pulled up causing a small hematoma in there. This could be said with certainity only after getting physically  examined by a doctor. If you are using astroglide for the first time, sensitivity to this reagent can not be excluded.

From 21yrs old on, I have had multiple procedures to deal with my urethra stricture. 5 yrs ago, I had surgery. From that point on, I have noticed that my perineum tends to get swelling when I get an erection. The swelling begins before the erection begins and lasts longer than the erection does. It does not usually hurt. My last procedure was in 11/13. It was a dilation. This Morning (6:30am), when I ejaculated it was v. painful... after I could not urinate, when I tried it was v. painful (tried 2xs 8am, 10am). The pain lasted a while (usually my painful urination stops when the urination stops, for some reason the pain today lasted between 30mins for the first urination and an hour 30minutes plus for the second). At 10:30am, I took a cab to the emergency room... during the ride, I noted that my perineum was still swollen and I had to hip sit and I also had to walk bow legged into the hospital. (the head of my penis was also hurting). At 12noon, I was able to urinate a little (dribble stream with pain). At 1:30pm, I again urinated but the flow was less, pain was same. I believe that perineum was still swollen but it was not on my radar. I told I would have to get a Suprapubic catheter and had decided to have the procedure the next morning. While I was waiting to get admitted, at 3pm, I urinated and my flow normal (my normal) and with pain (still my normal). I also noticed that the swelling in my perineum was also gone. I decided against the procedure. I have urinated once since being home. It was again my normal flow. Am I crazy to connect the two and any ideas on why it is swelling. I spoke with one of the urologists and he didn t seem to think they were connected. In truth, I have never brought the topic of the swelling up with any of the urologists I have worked with over the last few years because it never occurred to me. We are now talking about a urethra re-construction but if this perineum thing is contributing to my urethra problems and could be fixed with a less intrusive procedure... (and buy me some time)... that would be great... again thanks...","Doctor":"Hi. Thanks for the elucidate self explanatory history.The perineal swelling along with the erection is suggestive that the part of the penis root has been herniating through the weakness of its covering.Secondly the other swelling you developed is suggestive of the diverticulum of the urethra, most probably developed due to stricture or the procedures blocked the out flow.I think the correction of this swelling is also a part of the next procedure. The easiest way to diagnose this is urethrography to outline the the urethra. This will help plan the nest procedure well."},{"Patient":"hi there, im inquiring for my husband whom is suffering from aches ect, he had the snip done around 9 years ago, procedure went well, a few years after the snip my husband was suffering with pain and swelling in the left testical, we followed this up and he was told that he had blew a seel, meaning his testy was being choked by variagus veins, so he had an operation to have his left testy removed. every now and then he has been suffering from a pain in the ball that is no longer there, when he urinates he feels a sensation running down the inside of his left leg, also he says he has a light burning sensation running down the same area, and pain near the scar where they made the incision for the removal of his testie, hubby has had prostate checks and all clear, sitting up causes him discomfort in the said areas..any insight would be much appreciated..","Doctor":"HI.

First of all the pain in the loin region is suggestive of the urinary tract infection may be with symptoms of obstruction. You need an urgent Ultrasonography. It is difficult to relate low sperm count ; the possible reason being the infection of the urinary tract giving a blockage of the ducts of seminal vesicles ( which stores the sperms).

The front part of penis is called a glans penis and it is usually covered by skin. This part is very sensitive to touch and its base has many nerve endings which makes it more sensitive. If you have undergone a surgery called circumcision in which the skin covering the glans is removed, u may experience hypersensitivity of glans penis for few weeks and it subsides by itself. Even without surgery when you retract the foreskin the glans may be over sensitive to touch which is common. If you drink excess water, you will urinate more and that's not abnormal.

Good morning. I am Dr Shareef answering your query.Even though masturbation is a normal physiological process in adults, over indulgence in this may affect your vitality and you may feel tired due to this over indulgence. However, there is no such pathological sequence to masturbation as such.Hair growth and mustaches etc are usually liked to the genetic make up of a person. There is not much medically one can do to grow more hair. However, you can consult a dermatologist for this.Similarly, if you are active enough, then there is no worry for not having muscle mass. Health is measured by how active a person is  and not by his muscle mass or fat.On your sleeping habits, you have to modify your life style habits. you should not sleep in the day time and keep your self engaged in some work or studies or in some outdoor activities. If you do this, automatically you will be getting good sleep in the night. You have to develop habit of changing your life style and it depends on your strong determination and not on any medications.I hope this information would help you in discussing with your family physician/treating doctor in solving this problem.

In fact, Masturbation is completely normal & doesn't have any bad effect to the body and mind.Regarding the problem of Erectile dysfunction, it is due to decreased blood supply to the penis.Though medications like Cialis & Viagra increase blood flow to penis & maintains erection, it can be improved by having a diet rich in fruits, vegetables, fish, nuts & honey.Connections between erectile dysfunction & excess use of porn has been reported in many studies.For those affected, recovery takes place by 6-12 weeks & mainly involves avoiding the causative factor, that is watching porn.Regarding the problem of premature ejaculation, it's mostly related to anxiety. So...don't worry about all this & stay relaxed.Avoid stress...practice meditation..this helps in improving concentration & builds up the confidence level.Avoid smoking & alcohol.Despite these measures, if you experience difficulty, it will be better to rule out other causes like high blood pressure, blood sugar and other local causes that impair blood flow to the genital organ.One more thing...avoid consuming any over the counter medication which claim to increase the size of penis or improve performance...it may be harmful.Wishing you a Healthy Life.Take care."},{"Patient":"Hi Dr , I am 26 years old and unmarried i am having nightfall problem since 4 years, due to this problem i am feeling weak in every aspect of physical and mental health kindly recommend me best diet routine exercise or any guidance that ease my problem and make me healthier again.

Masturbation is a natural thing.It is only harmful when you have a guilt about it or you are always preoccupied with it. Both the conditions are psychological issues rather than physical issues.At a younger age people usually have more sex drive and their frequency of masturbation is maximum. You can indulge in this activity as long as it is pleasurable and you have the drive for it. It should not cause you any pain. If you are doing excessive masturbation, then you have to decrease the frequency. You cannot stop masturbation totally because it is not a permanent solution.consider following things:1.First of all find out the cause of excessive masturbation. It could be because you are bored, lonely, hurt, stressed, or it could be because of pains from the past. 2. Identify the time when you indulge in masturbation frequently. If supposing it is at night then exercise just before going to bed. Exercise will also help you to be more tired and fall asleep faster. 3.Try to do activities that make you feel better. Motivate yourself to do things for yourself. 4.enjoy good time with your friends and family and join a gym along with your friends so that you spend maximum time outside where you cannot indulge in masturbation.5.Doing exercise regularly and proper diet are essential to good health. Exercise is very important because it releases endorphins from the body. 6.Doing yoga and meditation will keep you calm and relaxedAnd a very important thing is doing masturbation never affect your fertility so don't be worried about that.

There are neurologists who check for nerve conduction defects. Sometimes these are useful in such a clinical scenario. We should ideally not think of your two problems (poor erections and bladder muscle weakness) as separate entities and should check if one solution will help both problems. There are other investigations which can also be performed. These include a penile Doppler to test vascularity of your phallus. You can also be tried with medications like alpha-blockers to see if urine flow improves, and if required also add medication to improve bladder muscle tone which unfortunately is not very often successful.

It hurts like infection but I think my clitoris looks different then it looked before (looks like its torn). I had sex but the pain only started 4 days after. Thank you for your hepl.","Doctor":"Hello,Thanks for posting on HCM,Infection is the most likely cause for pain found on your clitoris. Clitoral pain is a specific subset of vulvodynia produced by neuralgia of the anterior division of the pudendal nerve. It is manifested by pain localized to the clitoris with or without associated pain such as vulvar vestibulitis and pelvic floor myalgia. The symptoms may be constant or variable and may improve or worsen with movement or sexual activity. The cause may be metabolic (rarely), traumatic (likely), or idiopathic (i.e., unknown).  Trauma from violent stimulation (which should occur shortly after sex and not only a couple of days after), tight clothing, or straddle injuries may produce these neuropathic changes.  In other cases, clitoris pain may come from an infection that may develop slowly and persist or worsen over time. What to do now? I suggest you see medical attention as soon as possible. Usually, it is rarely a problem, but if persisting you will have to receive treatment.

Presence of varicocele for a very long term would have spoiled the spermatogenic cells near totally, then you can not expect very good results. If the varicocele operation had not been done adequately, that may be another reason. You had this operation on left side. There is a possibility of minimal varicocele on right side, which also should be corrected. Usually it had been done on both sides together even if it is minimal on one side.There is no separate food recommendation for to improve the quality of semen.

Hematuria has many causes, including vigorous exercise, sexual activity, viral illness, trauma/injury, or infection such as a urinary tract infection (UTI).

Can that be the problem? I lost my last girlfriend because she said she enjoys oral sex and I wouldn t let her and even her rubbing her hand against the glans makes me go soft due to the pain.

I have understood your query. The scrotum and smooth muscles which are controlled by the autonomic nervous system.

Lot of misconceptions about masturbation is prevailing in the society. Masturbation is just like you are eating when you are hungry, drinking when you feel thirsty, going to toilet for natures call. Nobody can eat or drink more than what they need.If you got married at the age of 16 or 17 as in olden days you would have engaged in sex with your partner daily more than once. Nobody got affected because of this . Then it is same for masturbation. In no way it is different from normal intercourse. So there is nothing to worry.

My friend is having a bit of an issue and I would like some assistance. Hes very uncomfortable and I feel awful. I am an LPN, but this issue is puzzling me a bit. He's been breaking out in one or two little red bumps on the head of his penis and he's having pain during urination. He says the urgency hurts worse than the actual urination, but they both are painful. This lead me to believe he has a UTI, but I've never seen a rash or bumps with a UTI before. One of the bumps is bothering me a bit because it looks blister-like, but not quite like the beginning of herpes or warts. I am concerned that a girl he had relations with has given him something. Some help as to what this is would be greatly appreciated! Thank you!","Doctor":"This bumps are most likely due viral infection and burning indicates some secondary infection.Go for certain investigations like cbc.

If you are uncircumcised, you should be able to expose the head of your penis and to clean it during showers to clear out the smegma and prevent infection and cancer.

Nerves in the prostate gland are just outside the capsule of the prostate.

After the session, I masturbated and ejaculated with no problem - 20mins later I went to shower and use the toilet, but it hurt an incredible amount to try to urinate - to the point a drop may or may not have reached the end, but the pain caused me to stop: I tried a few times.

It's been maybe an hour since the incident and I am a littlre reluctant to try urinating again to avoid pain or further damage.","Doctor":"DearWe understand your concernsI went through your descriptions. I suggest you not to worry much. The pain could be due to inflammation of your urethral opening which is caused due to the insertion you mentioned.

Most likely, there has been inflammation of the penis that has obstructed the opening of the urethra. This has certainly caused obstruction that prevents him fro being able to urinate freely. The urethra is a very sensitive organ that needs t be addressed properly. I will like that you seek for medical consultation. Also, if he had just any blood drop out of his urethra, then it constitutes an emergency. For now, he can take pain medications to help relieve the pain and swelling. This may help but also, he need to get fully evaluated and treated.I hope this addresses your query fully.

It refers to aching or painful testicles, which some people may experience after sexual arousal that does not result in orgasm. This symptom occurs because blood builds up in the testicles during arousal, causing them to ache if the person remains aroused for too long. Although blue balls may be uncomfortable, it does not usually last long.

You can use some olive oil or some other mild oil to apply and eercise the forskin back and forth slowly and steadily. After some days pulling back of the foreskin should become much easier. The area beneath the foreskin is sensitive and it should irritate when you touch and this hould also be cared for with practice.Hope this answers your query.

I suggest you not to worry much. Sex is to be counted as a divine act. It is a meditation. During sex you forget yourself throughout the period of sex and that is real enjoyment. Sex should not be performed in a hurry, laklusturely, when you or your partner is tired, when you do not have the sexual urge etc. Go through the above  and see what is your problem. Unnecessary tension and anxiety can also lead to premature ejaculation. In any case, I donot think that you are suffering from some sexual problems. You are just 20 and don't be so eager in sexual matters. life is not only sex. Concentrate on education, career and future.Hope this answers your query.

I suggest you not to worry much. Sex is a divine act and meditation. We foreget ourself through out the sexual act and that makes it proper meditation. Sex should not be performed when you or your partner is tired, stressed. Sex should not be performed during unworldly timing and you should not hurry while doing sex. Erection is happening when blood is pumped into the penis and kept there in a certain pressure. The pressure is not sustained  due to the above mentioned reasons. Anxiety about is sex is also another factor. Dont come to a pretext. Yesterday happened never means it will happen tomorrow. Concentrate on career and not on sex.

I suggest you not to worry much. Your penis size of 3.5 inch even in erected state is enough to satisfy a women. I can assure you that a penis length of 2 inches is enough. Women vagina has sensory endings only upto 2 inches. Your dripping or leaking when watching porn or talking to  girl is because you are very much horny or you are exited sexually very fast and that is a good sign. Those people who are excited very fast can sustain the sexual erection for a long time. You can go for marriage without any second thoughts as you are very well doing sexually, and other things such as maturity, career etc are also satisfied.

I suggest you not to worry much. Sex is divine act and is a meditation. We forget ourself throughout the sexual journey and that is actual meditation. You should not involve in sex if you or your partner is tired, stressed. Sex should not be performed in a hurry and not during unworldly timing. Anxiety and presumptions about sex is also dangerous because they decrease your sexual ability. In most of the cases, prematurre ejaculation is due to psychological problems such as negative thinking, anxiety, stress and lack of sex education. Your case could be either of these.Let your wife come. Why be apprehensive? Why think that the same thing will happen again in future? Sex is not the life.

This is about my boyfriend who is 42 years old. We started to make out recently-not sex yet-however i noticed that i never see the head of the penis. It is covered with the foreskin. I tried pulling it back but he had a lot of pain. He said he can retract the foreskin when flaccid. He uses oil. However i never saw the skin retracting when he is erect. He said he has been like this from childhood. My initial thought was that this is phimosis. He said his problem is a short frenulum. He also looks really small down there-like 3-4 inches when erect. So 1) does he have a frenulum breve or phimosis 2) Can a short frenulum cause the head of the penis not to be exposed at all? the photos i have seen of this condition show the glans pointing downwards. With this man it is not like that-instead the glans is not exposed at all. 3) could his small size be due to problems like phimosis or frenulum breve? Can these conditions limit erections? 4) if he gets treated for will there be any increase in size at least up to an inch? I am not looking for a big guy it is just his small size worries me.

Having a 28 grams prostate gland is expected for your age of 50. I would recommend doing a serum PSA to screen for prostate cancer. Otherwise if you are generally happy with how you urinate? Do you have urinary frequency (urinating within 2 hours or less) ? Urinary urgency ? waking up more than twice per night to urinate? having a weak stream or urine? having interrupted urination and straining during urination?These  are symptoms of prostate problems or BPH and fairly common among men above age 50. if you have one or more of these symptoms I would suggest consulting with a urologist so he can do a digital rectal examination (DRE) to palpate the prostate for any nodulations and to give you a prescription for your prostate and improve your urination (e.g. tamsulosin, terasozin ...) If you're urination is okay and you are not suffering from any of the above mentioned urinary symptoms then your enlarged prostate is not causing any clinical consequence to you.

Plz answer this question very kindly. All the time running after the money is mightier then free serve to the poor n needy people..I left the question couple of month ago.n this is not only my problem  all most all the teenagers facing this same problem....","Doctor":"Hi. . Masturbation is most common among teenagers. However, if it's becoming an obsession that inhibits other aspects of your life, or you belong to a religion or philosophy that forbids masturbation, it's possible to curb the impulse, gather your self-discipline, and take control of your urges. I can suggest u some steps. First stop punishing yourself and remember, you're human. Humans make mistakes, and they have sexual urges. Neither of these things makes you a bad person. Resist the urge of sinking into despair by remembering the times spent feeling sorry for yourself. Remove anything that tempts your urge to masturbate like access to pornographic material, loneliness and boredom. Stop being lonely. Find another outlet for your time and energy like being creative, develop a new hobby, do sports, engage always in some productive work. If you've tried everything and just can't seem to get your addiction under control, it might be time to get some professional help and ask for assistance. Don't feel ashamed, and remember that many people have similar problems like this and seeking help is a brave action. Regards."},{"Patient":"I think I might have either gonorrhea or a UTI, but I can t tell. I am honestly really scared and embarrassed so I can t tell anyone. The only symptom I seem to have is burning during urination which appeared the week of Christmas. It s not very severe, something a slight tingle then sometimes an uncomfortable burn but it s not really painful. I have no discharge, swelling, or redness in or around my area. I am a male who has only had sex with one woman twice, about a month before the symptom appeared.","Doctor":"DearWe understand your concernsI went through your details. I suggest you not to worry much. From the details you have given, Most doctors can only conclude that there is something wrong. You have to go for a detailed investigation with a physician.Burning could be due to simple urinary tract infection or inflammation. Such a condition can be cured with the help of simple antibiotic treatment with plenty of water. But you must visit a physician first. Do it as early possible for early cure.You might need psychological counseling and or psychotherapy.

I suggest you not to worry much. Masturbation is not a sin and not an unhealthy matter. Everyone masturbates. Even animals masturbate. That is quite natural. From the description you gave, I conclude that you have just some sort of anxiety about unhealthiness of masturbation, and that could be reason for your erectile dysfunction. Exercising is good and exercising cannot cause erectile dysfunction. But anxiety about it can. Therefore, stop worrying about exercise and masturbation. Just live life as it comes. Don't worry about what will happen next, because nobody can predict that. You might need psychological counseling and or psychotherapy.

I was masturbating with cotton like material, the fillings that you would find in stuffed toys. I was able to remove most of the material on my penis, but I am worried about having some cotton strands in my urethra. Should I be concerned? As far as urinary track/bladder issues, what are some signs that I should be aware of?

So i wang to know that whether this loosening of sperms without masturbation is harmful and if it is then at what extent. Please kindly inform me.","Doctor":"Hello,Thanks for choosing health care magic for posting your query.I have gone through your question in detail and I can understand what you are going through.Masturbation is a safe way of expressing ones own sexual desires. It leads to know physical or mental problems. The sperms and semen which are formed in the body are meant to come out of the body. They cannot be accumulated in the body and like urine they are formed in the body and are thrown out. They may come out on having sex or during masturbation. If you are indulging in none of these then the sperms and semen will come out at night by self (night fall) or routinely during any sexual stimulation. This is a normal phenomenon and will not cause any harm to you. Masturbation is safe and will cause no harm. It is harmful only when  indulged in excessively leading to avoidance of normal work and schedule.

Keeping the area dry & avoid too much exposure to water or sweat formation. 2. Antihistamine preparations like cetirizine to reduce the itching sensation & provide symptomatic relief. 3. Application of topical antifungal cream to tackle the causative organism. If symptoms still persist or aggravate further, then it will be better to consult a Dermatologist & get a proper examination done to find out the actual cause.

For those affected, recovery takes place by 6-12 weeks & mainly involves avoiding the causative factor, that is watching porn.Avoid stress...practice meditation..this helps in improving concentration & builds up the confidence level. Avoid smoking & alcohol. Despite these measures, if you experience difficulty, it will be better to rule out other causes like high blood pressure, blood sugar and other local causes that impair blood flow to the genital organ.One more thing...avoid consuming any over the counter medication which claim to increase the size of penis or improve performance...it may be harmful.

The pealing went away, but remained sensitive. I went to my Urologist who check for STD s and I came up clean. Started having issues with urinating and went on a month of Cipro.

Now its a type of anxiety disorder and the person normally suffers from performance anxiety where in he is anxious if he can perform or not. First you can try the start stop technique. Your wife is supposed to start stimulating you and the moment you are about to ejaculated she is supposed to stop all the stimulaton and and hold your penis head hard. Now this should be repeated. Perineal exercises also help. These are the muscle exercises that occur when you contract the perineal muscles like when you are trying to stop the urine or feces. You have to do this contrations repeatedly daily to tone up the perineal muscles. One solution is medications. Some patients are not willing to wait for these acts to produce results and instead demand medicines. I prescribe them 12.5 mg paroxetine at night and they are doing good. Normally one should try until 25mg of Paroxetine. If paroxetine is not effective then Dapoxetine is an option. It has to be given 1 hour before having sex and will prolong the sexual interval. Hope I am able to answer your concerns.If you have any further query, I would be glad to help you.In future if you wish to contact me directly, or want to know further details, you can use the below mentioned link:bit.ly/dr-srikanth-reddy"},{"Patient":"The other day I had sexual intercourse for 12 hours straight.

As you had the surgery recently sexual relationship is usually advised after 3 weeks, by which the sensitivity will get settled to an extent. If it is extremely difficult for you to wear pants, you can have the dressing covering the glans penis for some more days. It will help you to avoid the friction of the skin of your penis. After sometime you can apply some local anesthetic creams on the advice of your surgeon. With these measures you can reduce the sensitivity.Wish you speedy recovery. Dr S.Murugan"},{"Patient":"Hi!

After recent unprotected sex with my current girlfriend I noticed some pimple like bumps on the side of my penis... It started as two one on the mid right side and one on the mid left side.... The recent bout of sex was vigorous and slightly rough so I figured it was due to that and chalked it up as ingrown hairs or just zits... The bumps formed white heads and all but popped on their own. they appeared 1-2 days after this sexual instance. 2 more days went by and as I went to urinate I noticed the same bumps some with white heads, some without spread all around my groin area... Not in clusters but individual bumps scattered midway up my penis shaft to the base, above my penis in my pubic hair as high as my waistband of my boxers, on the upper inner part of both thighs almost in the crease of my groin. I am concerned it might be hsv 2. The bumps will pop and become tender afterwards but not any excruciating pain. They pop with clear pus normally no blood, and they hurt when popped to the point that I don t want to squeeze them all the way to fully drain them. My girlfriend said she got tested 3 months ago and was completely clean. she also is very trustworthy( I know many may doubt this but trust em she is) and she hasn t been with anyone else since being checked out. Is it possible for me to have an std from someone else long before that lied dormant until it was triggered by our recent spat of rough sex?

They usually develop into grouped ulcers which remain for a week or so. It will not contain pus, only clear fluid. So you present lesions are unlikely to be due HSV 2 as they extended up to your pubic area and contains pus.Possibilities of hair folliculitis can be thought off. Oral antibiotics for a week or so along with some topical creams contains either antibiotic or antiseptic. Use of antiseptic soaps also would help.

I am Dr Shareef answering your query.Most of the time, this happens due to unnoticed repeated  trivial injury to the testes even during normal day to day activities if the testes are not supported by properly fitting undergarments. If I were his doctor, I would advise him for a well fitting testicular support, some anti inflammatory, and a broad spectrum antibiotic if need be after sending a urine sample for routine and culture sensitivity test to rule out a urinary tract infection which could give rise to similar problem. If there was no relief, I would advise him for a Doppler ultrasound of both testes to rule out a chronic torsion of the testis. Further management would depend on the investigation reports. The sperm count could get affected in case of untreated infection of the urogenital system and also a condition called varicocele. So, it has to be ruled out by a physical examination of your fiance by a doctor.I hope this information would help him in discussing with his family physician/treating doctor in further management of his problem.

So that appropriate management steps could be taken. Also avoid wearing tight trousers & underwear...as it will cause sweating & predispose to fungal infections. Wishing you a Good Health.

The pain on my right started first and then the left started. Though both are only a slight pain, the left-sided pain is worrying me because it s more intense than the pain on the right side. The left-sided pain seems to increase when i take in a breath. But what REALLY worries me overall is the churning in my stomach. I am 14, male. Is this alright, doctor? PS: 1..I masturbate a lot. at least once or twice daily. 2..I RECKON THAT THE RIGHT-SIDED PAIN STARTED EVEN BEFORE THE CHURNING. 3..I started masturbating at 10 or 11 years. Thanks in advance, doctor.","Doctor":"DearWe understand your concernsI went through your description. I suggest you not to worry much. You are just 14 and you started worrying about so many things. That is the problem. When we worry, we become anxious. Anxiety produces so many uneasy feelings in the body and pain in different parts of the body iscommon. Pain in the stomach area is most common and you are victim to that.Instead of worrying about what you have not, concentrate on your education and career. Masturbation is common and natural and every man do it. Even animals masturbate. Masturbation twice a day is also normal in your age. When you grow, your priority changes to education and career and you start spending your energy towards more useful work.You might need psychological counseling., I am more than happy to provide telephone psychological counseling through healthcaremagic.

Before, when my sperm ejaculate it goes for a long distance with a high pressure and a big amount.

I suggest you not to worry much. You should not worry much about such things. Ejection length depends on just one factor, and that is the viscosity of the semen. If the viscosity is less, or semen is watery, it ejects for a long distance. If semen is thick, it is sticky, it travels lesser distance.Along with age, the quantity of semen and viscosity decreases. Emotions, anxiety, stress, fatigue etc are also other factors. Bur there will not be any problem for the effectiveness of semen.

The infection might have come by the way of trimming the pubic hair or might have come from the vaginal discharge of your wife during intercourse.In both the cases, you have to go for a topical antiseptic and antifungal ointments, and also a broad spectrum antibiotic for the cellulitis/infection in the thigh.I hope this information would help you in discussing with your family physician/treating doctor in planning your treatment.

Can u shed some of your expert opinion.. thanks Chris","Doctor":"ello,Thanks for choosing health care magic for posting your query.I have gone through your question in detail and I can understand what you are going through.Prostatitis is difficult to treat illness and some times the infection just stays back to appear later on. You may have to do culture and sensitivity of the semen to identify the causative organism. Yes there si a possibility of cancer as well but as the PSA is mostly coming back normal, it is likely that there may not be any cancer.

So doctor as a child of your please please give me a better solution to control it because I  want to be a perfect boy. Save me this type of bad work. I never watch bad film it is true.","Doctor":"Hi. . I understand your worry. First and very important thing to know is that masturbation is normal and healthy way for people to explore their own bodies and to find out what feels good, where and how they like to be touched and how to have an orgasm. Even though it is normal, some people feel ashamed or embarrassed about masturbation. This is partly because it has been wrongly labelled as deviant, harmful or sinful over the years, and many of these out-dated myths still exist. The frequency of masturbation varies in different individuals, for some people it may happen 2-3 times a day and for some 4-5 times a week. I will tell u some simple methods to come out of this habit. Remove anything that tempts your urge to masturbate like access to pornographic material. Avoid being lonely and keep your self busy in some usefull activities like sports, swimming, going out with friends etc. Find a new hobby, or cultivate a skill. Learning something that takes a while to master can refocus your brain on the delayed gratification of achieving goals instead of the instant gratification of masturbation. Even after doing all these things if u cant come out of habit and it is bothering u, it is better to consult a doctor. All the best.

Now we have to see the process of production of sperms by testis.I would suggest to get a colour doppler study of your scrotum to see if there is a varicocele, and FSH level in blood to see the functionality of testis.I have not seen scientific evidence for Miraqule . for IUI, 12-15 million per cc of grade 1 and 2 sperms are needed. You should avoid smoking,drugs, wear lose and cotton underwears,  and avoid OTP medicines because many could suppress sperm production.DR SAATIISH JHUNTRRAA"},{"Patient":"Hi Sir,Sometimes I masturbate before I go to sleep at night. Usually nothing is wrong, but sometimes (and this always occurs at night, I've found) after I masturbate, a few minutes later I have to urinate. And when I do, it is usually very painful. The feeling doesn't pass either. My scrotum usually gets very tightened up, and there is painful feeling above my crotch and i also feel to bathroom.. Do you have any idea about it.. please can you help me for this","Doctor":"DearWe understand your concernsI went through your description. I suggest you not to worry much. People do masturbate, before going to sleep. Most of them feel the urge of urination because of the sensory elements of your urethra. Quite normal. Occasional pain and tightness is also normal. But if the pain is recurring again and again, you should consult a physician. But I think, the pain and tightness is in your thoughts. Better to ignore it for the time being, and concentrate in priority activities.You might need psychological counseling., I am more than happy to provide telephone psychological counseling through healthcaremagic.

Might have been the biggest mistake of my life now that I look at it. im so depressed about this any way. the woman gave me a hand job and nothing more. It was a fully naked one so her naked body was on my body but not in a super sexual way but more sensual. she rubbed her breast on my but her vagina never touched my skin from what i remembered. After my session I had a tingle on my penis that wudnt go away. I figure it was due to the warmed oil that she used. A month or so later I had a few little bumps show up near the shaft of my penis. I was scared and went to the clinic immediately. The doctor instantly told me that this was Herpes and I would have it for life and i could infect a woman and destroy her ability to have kids and that I needed to take some pills for a week and then buy more later on. I left the clinic feeling like committing suicide because of this doctor . It felt like he was reading from a play book or something. Any way the bumps turned to scab and went away. Also my anus began to hurt at times as well. the tingly feeling in my penis never went away.. it stayed there for a few weeks and might have went down a bit but always came back. I began changing my eating habits and did a full body cleanse. I did not take the medicine that the doctor ordered me too. I just didn t feel comfortable doing so after his horror story. after a month and a half everything went away and the tingle went away for a bit. but wud sometimes happen again after i masturbated or had sex with a condom. i went back to eating the same and smoking and not working out as i did. and after maybe 2 months now I have the bumps again. I wish i could say that this is just sum fungus from my lotion or from something else. I still haven t got a official test which I will be getting next week. can you help me to understand why i have the tingle constantly and is that something normal with herpes cases. Also why is it that right after the massage i had this tingle. i m really depressed and I am somewhat of a well known figure in my community so i dont know what to do with my life at the moment.","Doctor":"HiItching or tingling on genitals or around anus is a symptom of herpes.There is no cure for genital herpes. But the symptoms can be lessened and prevented with treatment. Treatment can also reduce the risk of infecting others.Antiviral drugs like acyclovir is used for treatment.You can get a remission by treatment.      When symptoms recur, they usually come on during times of emotional stress or illness. That's because, during these times, your body's immune system may be less able to suppress the virus and keep it from becoming active. There are also things you can do to avoid passing the virus to other parts of your body, as well as to other people. Take these steps:Don't kiss when you or your partner has cold sores.Avoid oral sex when either partner has oral or genital sores.Don't have genital or anal contact when any sores are present.Wash your hands with soap and water after touching infected areas.Don't wet your contact lenses with saliva. There are things you can do to relieve the discomfort and severity of the symptoms during an outbreak. Home treatments include:Take painkillers such as aspirin, acetaminophen, or ibuprofen.Bathe sore areas with a warm salt-water solution twice a day (1/2 teaspoon salt with 1/2 pint warm water).Let air circulate around the sores by wearing loose-fitting clothes.Put an ice pack on the affected area. Wrap the ice pack in a towel or piece of cloth.Get plenty of rest.hope this may help youthanks"},{"Patient":"Had a circumcision 4 weeks ago.

Thanks RG","Doctor":"Varicoceles are dilated blood vessels in the scrotum. They are usually asymptomatic, although they may cause pain or a heavy sensation in the scrotum, and they may contribute to infertility. 90% of varicoceles are on the left side because of the anatomy of the left spermatic vein and the increased likelihood of valvular incompetence. The cremasteric and deferential veins are rarely involved. Diagnosis is by clinical examination. The cardinal sign is a scrotal mass that feels like a bag of worms. The precise mechanism for the harmful effect of varicocele on sperm quality or quantity is not known. Theories implicating increased pressure, temperature, oxygen deprivation, and decreased antioxidants have all been put forward. There is some evidence that a clinically palpable varicocele is associated with testicular atrophy, low sperm count, and poor sperm motility. Some of these parameters improve after surgery to the varicocele. The scientific evidence to support increased fertility, as measured by successful pregnancies after varicocelectomy, is poorNo treatment is required, but surgical intervention is required to manage symptomatic varicocele. Following surgical intervention the complete resolution of the varicocele implies a favorable prognosis, although it is not clear whether surgery improves fertility."},{"Patient":"hi sir,i am 22 years old,i am suffering from night fall problem everynight.that's why i stop masturbation and to watch porn movie.but this is not working.and nightfalling daily,so what should. i do now...plz help me sir........i take lots of good medicine.........but its not working........ plz give me a solution.","Doctor":"hinightfall medicines? like what? i know no real medicines for that?what i can suggest is that you relax about it.it is almost usual at your age.try these non pharmacological, non conventional things-sleep on time- dont delay your sleeping hours- and reduce your sex oriented activities, if any.wash your feet before sleeping, and if possible have a bath.relax absolutely, dont be worried, its a normal phenomenon. if u worry too much, the anxiety wont exactly help uand avoid medicinesyou are not illbest of luck"},{"Patient":"hello, sometimes gives me some small twinges in the left testicle and left groin at the same time like a bite from the testicle to the groin. in which the testicle feels the sting with more intensity then transmitting to the groin with a slight impression in the groin. but that dont hurt me its just a awkward impression","Doctor":"hiread your querythis sounds like varicocoeleread on the answer for detailsVaricocele occurs when the network of veins that leave the testis becomes elongated and enlarged. Normally, veins allow the blood to flow away from the testicle - if there is something wrong with them, blood builds up in the testes.Varicoceles can lower a man's sperm count and undermine the quality of his sperm. In some cases, the testicles may shrink.It is common for the patient to experience no signs or symptoms at all. In some cases there may be pain, which can....be dull or sharp. There may be a sensation of heaviness. Some describe it as a dragging-like pain...worsen when the patient is physically exerting himself, standing or sitting. Prolonged periods of exertion are more likely to bring on pain...get worse later on during the day..feel better when the patient is lying downEventually most varicoceles grow and the person becomes more aware of them. Often described as feeling \\"like a bag of worms\\".During a physical exam a doc may be able to feel the mass of veins, or the bag of worms.

I am Dr Thakker and shall be answering your question.I can understand your anxiety with regards to precum soiling of the condom head leading to a pregnancy. I will try my best  to answer your question and guide you through it.Technically pre cum is secreted by the bulbourethral glands with some contribution from the cowpers glands. It may contain some amount of spermatozoa. In your case there is a theoretical possibility that the pre cum may have contained your spermatozoa. They can enter your partners vagina during the intercourse and lead to fertilisation of the ovum leading to a pregnant stage. I cannot quantify the chance of her getting pregnant from such a soiling of the condom. I would recommend you to have  a urine pregnancy done for her to be sure.I hope this helps you out. If you have any more questions, please do not hesitate to write back to me.Yours sincerely,Dr Thakker."},{"Patient":"Hello, i got a spot of maybe 3mm in size around urethra of my penis.

Body produces sperm cells whenever it is sexually aroused. Produced semen should be thrown out of the body. Sexual intercourse, masturbation helps here. If you do not indulge in such activities, body finds its ways to throw out the semen and one method is night fall of drips while urination. These procedures are normal and cannot cause physical weakness. Body weakness, premature gray hair etc are not at all related with night fall and dripping of semen.

Findings: there are 3 soft tissue nodules in the penis. The dominant is located along the left midshaft and is located outside tunica albuginea compressing it, but within Buck s fascia , and measures approximately 2 cm in longest dimension. Tunica albuginea in mildly thinned. There is mild increased enhancement underlying the lesion within the corpus canvernosum. The second nodule is located at the left base of the penis outside the tunica albuginea and within the Buck s fascia. The third is located along the right shaft and is centered on the tunica albuginea, disrupting it, involving the underlying corpus cavernosum and overlying the pericavernosal space. The dominant nodule demonstrates small heterogeneous poorly enhancing foci. The 3 similar nodules corresponds to the hyperechoic nodules on Ultrasound. There is an 8mm nodule located along the dorsal right proximal shaft with different signal characteristics. Ages lobe in signal on T1 and T2, with peripheral enhancement. The nodule appears to be located in the superficial subcutaneous space and indents the corpus cavernosum. The solitary nodule corresponds to the hypoechoic nodule on ultrasound. Glands penis, corpus spongiosum are normal. Urethra is normal. Impression: Three penile nodules some involving the tunica and some extrinsic to it. Differential diagnosis is atypical penile fibromatosis/pyronie s disease, less likely epithelioid hemangioendothelioma, granuloma annulare , foreign body reaction, or focal eosinophilic disease. A seperate pelvic MRI revealed everything normal and no lymphadenopathy. I have since been on a grain-free, dairy-free, gluten-free lifestyle. My morning blender shakes include 1/4 papaya, 1 banana, ice, handful of irish moss, 1 and 1/2 cup almond milk, a handful of raw cashews, 2 teaspoons of raw green pumpkin seeds and 1 tablespoon raw honey. In addition, i am taking pryteolytic enzymes(serapeptase) 12 a day, 4 capsules an hour and a half after my meals. Don t eat any meat unless its Organic and drinking about 1/1 gallon of distilled water a day. As a result, all 3 cysts have shrunk some but not all the way. When being intimate with wife, hardly ever have a problem with erection, she has no problem reaching orgasm but i do. I think I may have lost some of the deep level sensation. I am scheduled for pre-op with the V A Hospital in Miami, Fl and want to avoid surgery but would like to know if there is a laser option or natural option? THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME!!","Doctor":"HI. Maximum chances for such a problem is usually Peyronie's disease. The exact cause is not known to medical fraternity. serapeptase do help.

Thanks for the History nicely provided. It looks your varicocele has recurred and it is better to undergo a conventional operation for this to alleviate your pain.

Thank you","Doctor":"Hi,I would suggest that you have an ultrasound scan of the soft tissues of penis without and with a pharmacologically induced erection. This would be able to tell you if there is a plaque along the corpora cavernosa in which case you probably have an entity known as Peyronie' disease which is associated with induration of the penis with mild to moderate discomfort in it's initial stages. This test will also be able to quantify the blood flow to the phallus and indicate if there is a likelihood of erectile dysfunction which often coexists with Peyronies disease. The treatment would eventually depend on what is detected on the scan.Hope I have been able to help you.Regards."},{"Patient":"My back pain caused by too much masturbation has caused me a crazy sore.

Sildenafil (Viagra), Tadalafil (Cialis), Vardenafil (Levitra, Staxyn) These drugs enhance the effects of nitric oxide, a natural chemical your body produces that relaxes muscles in the penis. This increases blood flow and allows you to get an erection in response to sexual stimulation.2. Alprostadil self-injection into the base or side of your penis. Each injection generally produces an erection that lasts about an hour. 3. Penis pumps, surgery and implants- if medication did not works.further1. If you smoke, quit.2. Lose weight-Being overweight can cause or worsen erectile dysfunction.3. Exercise regularly - this educing stress, helping you lose weight and increasing blood flow.4. Avoid alcohol- Drinking too much or taking certain illegal drugs can worsen erectile dysfunction directly or by causing long-term health problems.5. Improve communication with your partner and consider couples or marriage counseling if you're having trouble working through problems on your own.Hope this helps.Please write back for further queries.Wishing you good health."},{"Patient":"hello sir i am suffering from sexual thought these thought are disturbting me lot  i     regulary masturbate.i  want to do stop these? even i am not  interset in praying a god .why these  hapennig with me i dont no?please help sir please.","Doctor":"Mastrubation is very normal unless it affects your regular activities.During teenage most of the boys masturbate as puberty hits them.

The superficial nerves supplying the penile skin are overstimulated and gives a feeling of vibration at that site. This is in particularly related to Vitamin B complex and cyanocobalamin.

Problems arise only when it becomes a preferred mode of sex even in the presence of a partner.

But when we overdo it, it causes negative effects on our body like, reduced testosterone levels, weakened central nervous system which together leads to premature ejaculation and erectile dysfunctions. It's advisable to completely quit masturbation to reverse its negative effects on your body and a healthy lifestyle that includes a nutritious diet full of milk nuts fruits and vegetables , and regular exercise and a good amount of sleep will get you back on track. You should expect a gradual improvement in your sex health as 15 years of damage does take some time to restore. Take care. Hope I have answered your question.

At that time she was receptive to the fact that something in her mind just wasn t right. She began medication and once a few months had past I began seeing real changes, it brought me so much hope and is what made me decide to go ahead and marry her because I thought we found the answer and all was solved. I was wrong, she became pregnant and due to the pregnancy she could not take her medication, I had no problem with that as she agreed once she had the child she would return to taking her medication. She became pregnant again before starting her medication back up and therefore could not, then after that pregnancy she said she wasn t going to be getting back on the medication because it just made her sleepy at night. I was devastated and afraid what would happen. 5 years after no medication, she had a really bad episode that I was unable to manage or cope with myself and I ended up in jail for her lying and making things up that didn t happen. Before she was diagnosed, she begged me to kill her for hours on end, I obviously refused and when I told her, not even if you wrote an authorized letter to do so would I even be able to think about doing such a thing. She then did just that, as if doing what I said wouldn t matter would change my mind? I am now sitting at my father s house because she wants a divorce because she is having an episode of extreme negative thoughts and is being very hostile just for starters.

My depression started then and i had a couple of suicidal thoughts back then.

I am 22 now and he has actually stopped drinking and isn t abusive anymore. But, now my mother is always angry at me. I feel as though she treats me differently than my two siblings (who are living in their own homes now). Whenever she shouts at me she swears at me with the most disturbing swearwords ever.

Such things can happen to anyone. However, it is non-permanent and with time she will feel ok. Let me tell you to get an appointment with a psychiatrist. She may need a drug therapy for some time. However, this can be managed by non-drug therapy as well: 1) Don't keep her alone. 2) Engage her in physical activity. 3) Talking to friends or social interaction can reduce it. 4) Support her emotionally. 5) Engage her in humorous discussions.

Poor attention leads to difficulty in completing tasks and causes anxiety as a result. There are a few medications which will help you recover from your problem. These medications are psychostimulants like Methylphenidate. These medicines are not available over the counter. I would suggest you to visit a doctor.

This is embarrassing, but I really want answers so I m asking here. My uvula will sometimes swell to the point where it can lay down on my tongue. I don t suffer from any anxiety disorders, but each time this has happened, I ve had a panic attack and hyperventilated. In my head, I KNOW I m not suffocating/ choking, but the constant swollen pressure inside my throat makes me agitated, sweaty, and manic. It s like my body is in terror, but my mind is saying There s nothing to worry about. It feels like I can t breathe (which ironically makes me hyperventilate) and it triggers my gag reflex. It s incredibly stressful. I start to shake, hyperventilate, gag, sweat, and experience panic despite the head knowledge that I m really not in danger. It s hard to explain what it feels like to feel your uvula touch multiple sides of your throat. It feels like my throat is clogged (because the contact is the circumference of the uvula) and I unconsciously swallow to clear the obstruction , which only makes it worse. If it matters, the sensation feels like I ve got thick mucous on my uvula, so I feel the need to repeatedly swallow. I suspect the swallowing inflames my uvula which makes it grow WAY bigger. Then it becomes hard to swallow and the sensation of having something stuck in my throat makes me feel like I m choking. In reality, I can still breathe, but it certainly raises all the alarms physiologically that I am choking/suffocating. I m a normal weight (170 lbs, 6 foot tall, 27 year old male). The panic attacks only ever happen AFTER my uvula swells. The uvula swells over the course of hours then stays swollen for hours more. At a certain critical mass, I feel the sensation of having the uvula down my throat which feels like I m choking. Additionally, my saliva glands go into overdrive. Since I can t really swallow, I m left leaning forward over a bowl and spitting to keep my mouth from filling with spit (which only exacerbates the sensation of drowning/ choking/ suffocating). Leaning forward also keeps the uvula from going down my throat though, feeling it lay on my tongue isn t exactly a huge improvement. This only happened 4-5 times in my life and all within the last 3 years. The first three times this happened, I ve gone to an emergency room. Each time, steroids reduced the swelling. I ve been referred to an Otolaryngologist about surgically reducing the size of my uvula. However, when the swelling goes away, my uvula is quite small and it s not medically necessary to do surgery. I ve had blood panels taken before by the ENT to see if I had some rare condition that caused the repeated swelling. Negative. The doctor suspected that I had strep throat, which can uncommonly cause swelling. However, I ve noticed that 4/5 times these swelling episodes happened, I ve had dry mouth due to Vyvanse or Mydayis. When on these medications, I swallow a lot more and my mouth often feels uncomfortable and a little swollen. Right now, as I write this, I am experiencing that same mucous in the back of my throat that makes me want to swallow sensation. If it becomes necessary, I ll see a doctor if it swells more. Are there any medications I can discuss with my doctor that can alleviate this problem? Final stipulation: my family has a history of drug abuse. With the sole exception of Mydayis (previously Vyvanse), I avoid any addictive medications and ask for alternatives that don t come with the risks. I love my life and I ve seen too many loved ones lives ruined by addiction. So if there are non addictive medications I can take to help, I would love to know what they are so I can consult with my doctor about taking them. Additional information: I have tried taking Advil to reduce the swelling. Any reductions in swelling weren t noticable. I ve tried Benadryl in case I m allergic to something (could be anaphylaxis for all I know), still no alleviation of my symptoms. Each time I ve gone to the doctor, it has taken multiple rounds of steroids (shots, don t remember the brand/name) to relieve the swelling. I suspect if I could take medication when I feel the uvula begin to swell, I could altogether avoid these episodes. However, I can t afford to see the doctor each time I SUSPECT it s going to happen. More often than not, the swelling has been minor no worse than a mildly sore throat. But 4-5 times have progressed to the point I described.","Doctor":"Hi, Panic attacks come under the anxiety spectrum of disorder and need to be treated fast.
