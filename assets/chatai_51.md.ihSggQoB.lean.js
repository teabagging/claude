Do you have any other medical problems ? Any issues with testicles or hormones.? I presume that there must have been a reason  for low testosterone and hence you were prescribed.NOW,clomifene  can increase a pituitary hormone called LH which indirectly can stimulate testis to produce more testosterone if your LH was low previously .There should have been a low response from your pituitary gland  and clomifene would have stimulated  it.This possibility can be confirmed by testing your testosterone. hope you are convinced.

Your question is very relevant. outside testosterone will suppress the sperm production. NOWwe have to find out why your testosterone  is low.Is there any other hormonal problems or not.For  that we have to do your pituitary hormones level FSH AND LH along with prolactin.If they are low then supplementing with hcg will help.We should also check the female hormone Oestrogen if you are very obese, so that decreasing it will increase your natural testosterone.

Frenulum  is the most sensitive part of Penis and it has an arterial supply which is the one bleeding during intercourse.Any friction or even the erection can disturbe the normal healing and can bleed.  But it depends up on the severity of the tear.So if there  is bleeding even after 3 weeks I suggest you to consult a surgeon who will help you with either antimicrobial ointments or if a big tear will suture or use cautery to coagulate. That will speed up the healing.Hope my answer helps you.

I am divorced for 2 years and met a wonderful lady with whom I have frequent intercourse. I began having a slight discharge from my urethrea several weeks ago and went to see my family physician who did a battery of tests for STDs of which all were negative. He prescribed a 7 day regimen of Cipro and Dioxycline which I finished taking both about 2 weeks ago. I still have a tickling sensation at the end of my penis and some minor itching towards my anus area and, although I can achieve an erection for a couple of minutes, it remains only partially erect when attempting intercourse. My doctor has given me samples of an ED pill which I have not used yet.

I understand your concern regarding trying to conceive while your husband is on Advil.This drug will will not interfere with the quality of the sperm. Studies have shown that even long term use of ibuprofen will not interfere with sperm quality.On the other hand you must know that the sperm is constantly formed within the testicles and the process of maturation can take up to 74 days. This is why men always have fresh sperm after 74 days. All things that can interfere with sperm quality (from the exterior - be it drugs, radiation and so on) are easily managed with not trying to procreate until new fresh sperm cells are formed.

Aceclofenac is an anti-inflammatory analgesic medication, which would relieve pain and helps to heal the wound well. 2. Cefopodoxime is an antibiotic, which needs to be taken as the course prescribed, and helps to prevent infection of the wound. 3. Lynoral contains ethinylestradiol, which is a synthetic version of the female sex hormone oestrogen. It would help suppress erection, as erection during the process of healing could hamper the process as well as it would be painful. Kindly take the medications and care of the wound as prescribed. Hope the information provided would be helpful. Wish you speedy recovery."},{"Patient":"I have unusually dark seminal fluid that ranges from a dark tan to brown color.

I ve had this since I was just a child and it s never been a problem, but over the past few months it seems to have gotten harder than normal. It s approximately one inch long, irregular in shape, and feels like a piece of cartilage. Since it s gotten harder, intercourse has been a little painful. The pain is minor, and only occurs when my foreskin slips on and off my glans. The growth is not very flexible, so it catches against my glans and flips over causing the discomfort.

I am a male aged 43. In the past I have had issues with hypogonadism and been successfully treated with topical testosterone replacement therapy, Androgel. I have reached a point where I wish to marry and have a family. During a relationship I had about a year ago, neither my girlfriend nor I took precautions. I never withdrew before ejaculating and never wore condoms. She was not on the pill and has not had a tubal ligation. We probably had sex about 200 times during our relationship. She married last month and it turns out she was three months pregnant when she wed. I ceased having physical relations with her in mid-2010. I went to my local urologist and he wrote an order for a sperm count to be performed in the local hospital laboratory. The area in which I was to produce the sample was not conducive to erection, stimulation and ejaculation. I tried several times but was unable to produce a sample on any of those occasions. At home, and with a woman, I have no problems with arousal, intercourse and ejaculation. I know that sperm banks and fertility clinics have more ideal settings for a man to do his business. There was the option of producing a sample at home and getting it to the hospital, but the time lag and logistics of that never worked out. The instructions with the order emphasized that the sperm count could be of less value the longer it took the sample to reach the lab. My question is about finding a reproductive clinic or sperm bank in my local area to find out if I am infertile or not. Thank you.","Doctor":"Hello, our local health facility can guide you better if you have any such facility nearby or not.

He was rushed and uncomfotable when producing the sample.  Could this have anything to do with it? We go back tomorrow for a second iui to hopefully add to the sperm inserted today.","Doctor":"Hi, Thanks for posting in HCM. I understand your concern. Intrauterine insemination (IUI) is a fertility treatment that involves placing sperm inside a woman’s uterus to facilitate fertilization. The main aim of IUI is to increase the number of sperm that reach the fallopian tubes, which would increase the chance of fertilization. Before IUI procedure, ovulation stimulating medications are used, in which there is monitoring to determine when the eggs are mature. The IUI procedure will then be performed around the time of ovulation, typically about 24-36 hours after the surge in LH hormone that indicates ovulation will occur soon. The semen sample will be washed in the lab to separate sperms from the seminal fluid. A catheter will then be used to insert the sperm directly into the uterus. The process may be repeated if the sperm count is low, thus increasing the possibility of conception.  The next step is to watch for signs and symptoms of pregnancy.

Have a healthy, nutritious diet rich in fresh fruits, vegetables and whole grains.5. Exercise regularly.6. Get sufficient rest.7. Keep your scrotum cool , because heat slows sperm production.

For the last couple of years, I have felt various negative symptoms but hadn't started to relate them to masturbation until this past year or so.  These include but aren't necessarily limited to: constant fatigue, insomnia, hair loss, muscle soreness, ringing in the ears, lightheadedness upon standing, stress, pretty severe anxiety, frequent panic disorder / attacks, heart palpitations, irritability, etc.  I used to masturbate daily and did so for years, it seems.  And, even though it was just a handful of rare times, I remember doing it two times per day on a couple occasions (less than 10-15, I'm sure).  The past couple of months I have been trying to limit the frequency of this.  I have done it 3-4 times per week.  I even went about a month without ejaculating at one point recently but did still somehow always manage to stimulate myself so I didn't feel all that better.  I have ejaculated about two times so far this new year and am now on day 4 of no masturbation.  I'd like to know if you believe my symptoms are due to this and what I can do to really start on the road to recovery.  In February, I went to a local emergency department for heart palpitations.  I had tests done: EKG, blood, urine, x-ray, etc.  All came back normal gratefully.Thank you so much in advance for reading my inquiry.  I look forward to your knowledgable response very soon.Bradley","Doctor":"Hi,Thanks for writing in.1. Masturbation is a safe sexual behavior when done in limit.

It is good if you realize that come of the symptoms like anxiety, fatigue and insomnia can happen from too much masturbation and you are taking measures to control it.4.

Do you masturbate? Night fall is called nocturnal emission (NE). NE is normal and is never unhealthy. NE is body's process with which it removes the stored semen. Stored semen is a waste product and body has to remove it. Usually stored semen is removed through masturbation or sex. If you do not masturbate or engage in sex, body ejects the semen its own through NE. In fact, to control your NE, you can practice masturbation twice or thrice a week. I reassure you, NE is a normal body process and is automatic. This cannot harm your health.If you require more of my help in this aspect, please use this URL.

I assure you, the present symptoms, pain in your legs and the chest pain, are not associated with the current masturbation. Masturbation consumes a good amount of energy. If you masturbate in an already tired condition, it is quite natural that your body will show the fatigue and pain. Due to frequent masturbation, your energy will be used much more without replenishing energy. This could cause fatigue, tiredness and thereby depression and anxiety. Depression, stress and anxiety are known to produce physical symptoms such as pain.

You are masturbating from the age of 12. That is from your puberty period. I do not know your present age. In any case, in the initial stages, masturbation twice a day is OK. But as age progresses, it should be reduced to once per day and then further reduced to thrice or four days a week. This is to keep your physical vigor intact, because masturbation spends energy. Masturbation just spends energy, no other medical problems.If you masturbate frequently, your energy level will be low and you will be tired. Naturally you will be depressed and therefore anxious.

The whole of the procedure is automatic and natural. The involuntary drawing inward of your penis is a process which happens when body is stressed or fatigued. Whenever you workout, the blood is being drained from your genital area because it don't need blood at that period and passed it to the required areas. So your genitals shrinks. You do not need any medical treatment on this matter. Just, you should stop being anxious about it. You should be satisfied that your erection power is still intact.

He is 45 years old and a heart patient as well, he did his by-pass operation since 9 years ago and he has diabetics which is type 2 and high blood pressure as well. So what are the ways that i should follow to make him impotent permanently?","Doctor":"Dear, We understand your concernsI went through your details. I do not know why you want to make that man impotent. The given medical and organic conditions do not warrant making him impotent. Any way, vasectomy is the best way to make a man completely impotent and after doing vasectomy, a man cannot reproduce. Vasectomy is a surgical procedure for male sterilization and/or permanent contraception. During the procedure, the male vas deferens are severed and then tied/sealed in a manner so as to prevent sperm from entering into the seminal stream (ejaculate) and thereby prevent fertilization.

Sperm cells do come out before and after urine. Such a process is involuntary, automatic and natural. This happens because your body is expelling sperm cells which are stored within your body. Your body produces sperm cells whenever you are sexually excited and stores. This stored sperm cells are removed from body through ejaculation while you do sexual intercourse or masturbation.

Therapy isn’t usually recommended, however, if your testosterone levels fall within the normal range for your age.There’s no magic solution for boosting your testosterone, but some natural remedies may help.

Please understand, masturbation is natural and normal. Masturbation cannot harm your health, sexual ability or it cannot reduce your penis size. Your back pain, weakness are not attributed to masturbation habit.

Even a 2 inch erect penis size will be able to satisfy any woman across the world. Your all these trouble are due to lack of knowledge about sex, sexual organs and procedure. Premature ejaculation is also due to the anxiety and obsession arised out of wrong knowledge.  I suggest you to consult a psychologist online or in person for counseling sessions.

Sometimes after I masturbate I get a painful second erection and if I masturbate the pain goes away and I ll be just fine for the third erection, sometimes I can even masturbate twice and the third erection will hurt. I don t necessarily need to masturbate for the pain to go away, sometimes I pour cold water on my penis to kill the erection and after it dies the pain completely disappears.","Doctor":"Dear, We understand your concernsI went through your details. Semen leakage is a normal and involuntary process and there is nothing to worry about it. As you are already aware, the semen is being produced when you are sexually aroused. The produced semen is stored within your body as a waste product. Body needs to eject the waste. If you masturbate, the stored semen goes out. Otherwise, the body throws it out through urine or nocturnal ejaculation (night fall). This process is pretty much normal.The pain you are talking about after ejaculation, during second masturbation etc are due to the hard handling of penis during masturbation. Please be soft while masturbating. This improves the sexual pleasure as well as it improves the retaining capacity.You may consult a psychologist for counseling.If you require more of my help in this aspect, please use this URL.

Frequent masturbation or masturbation habit do not have any adverse effect on your sexual health or ejaculation time or erection. Masturbation is normal and natural. Masturbation is never unhealthy. But you should make sure to reduce the frequency of masturbation to thrice or four times a week. Masturbation causes tiredness. The more tiredness, the more stressed and week you feel. These issues are temporary. If you take sufficient rest and fluid, the tiredness will go away.Penis too hard and curved is also normal and is good for perfect sexual intercourse.

Naturally, they are very much worried and want to know whether medicines can be helpful. Two things must be remembered 1) Semen Report must be REPEATED from an AUTHENTIC LABORATORY after ABSTINENCE of 3-5 days. This is important, as the sperm count varies day to day. It takes almost 3 months to produce the sperms. therefore, if today you wear very tight underwear or you have high fever, your sperm count (checked after 3 months from today) will be low. As a result, a SINGLE ABNORMAL SEMEN ANALYSIS report does NOT HAVE ANY SIGNIFICANCE. You need to repeat it. 2) Both Male and Woman should be seen together. What treatment is required, actually depends on the reports of both the partners, their age and duration of infertility.  Moreover, the pregnancy will ultimately happen on the woman. That's why, we need to see both together. What medicines should I take if the second semen analysis report is also abnormal? If all depends on how abnormal the report is. In case of mild abnormalities, we give medicines called \\"Antioxidants\\" (special types of minerals and vitamins that act on the sperms) for 2-3 months and ask to repeat the test again to see if there is any imporvement. At the same time, some life-style changes are advised. These include avoidance of smoking and alcohol, reducing weight, avoidance of using tight underwear, prolonged sitting and driving. However, if the problem is severe, you can take antioxidants. But it is more IMPORTANT to do some tests to FIND OUT THE CAUSE. Sometimes, we can find the cause like diabetes, which if controlled, can improve your sperm count without any other treatment. What tests are required? You may need physical examination of your genital organs by the doctor. You may be advised some blood tests for hormones (Testosterone, FSH, LH, Sugar etc). Some ultrasound examination of your testicles or prostate gland may be advised. In severe cases, some genetic testing (blood test to see if there is any chromosomal problem) may be needed. Can any medicines help if there is severe problem? In most of the cases, medicines cannot help. You can take antioxidants but SHOULD NOT RELY solely on it. In most cases, you will require IUI or IVF. However, there is ONLY ONE CASE where medicines can ACT DRAMATICALLY. That is if there is problem in the pituitary gland (situated in the brain). In that case, taking gonadotrophin injections for 3-6 months will significantly improve your sperm count. What's the problem if medicines are taken for long time? As such, medicines will not harm. But if you take medicines despite the fact that your sperm count is not improving, you can land up in azoospermia. This is because, in male having severe oligospermia, there is a tendency that sperm count may further decrease over time. therefore, relying on medicine will INDIRECTLY HARM you. Rather, you should think of IUI or IVF. Can Testosterone be taken? Even if your testosterone is low, if you start taking tablet/ injection of testosterone from outside, your SPERM COUNT WILL DECLINE FURTHER. Therefore, under any circumstances, if you want to become father, you SHOULD NOT TAKE TESTOSTERONE. Sometimes, after hormonal tests, we can advise tablets like Letrozole, which can help to improve the testosterone level, indirectly. IUI or IVF- What to do? If the sperm count is mildly/ moderately low, IUI (Intrauterine Insemination) can be tried. however, if its severely low, you should go for special type of IVF (in vitro fertilization), called ICSI (Intracytoplasmic Sperm Injection). All of these will be done using your sperms only. Hope I have answered your queries. Let me know if I can assist you further.

These tests will help to detect epididymitis, inguinal hernia, damage to the nerves(DN), Orchitis, Kidney stones, developing hydrocele, tesiculat torsion, cancer,etc.Your treatment will depend on the pathology detected  & the severity of your clinical symptoms. You may be treated with medicines(antibiotics, pain medications) or surgery (in case of hernia, testicular torsion,etc). Get the tests done, get treated at the earliest.Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further. Regards, Dr. Nupur K, General & Family Physician"},{"Patient":"Hi.. This question is to the Sexologist/Urologist. I am a 33 year old male, married since 3 years.Had a healthy sex life till recent 3 to 4 months .. weak erection and cannot ejaculate after insertion. Lately when iam with wife absolutely no erection at all. Masturbation is fine though and erection and retention during masturbation is also fine. What to do ??","Doctor":"Dear, We understand your concernsI went through your details. If your masturbation and during masturbation erection and ejaculation after masturbation is fine, then the problem is purely psychological. There could be some episode with which you are unable to maintain erection, ejaculation or week erection. Psychological problems like stress, anxiety, simple disappointment and depression can lead to temporary erection and ejaculation problems. These are temporary but many people do worry about these issues and obsess. Such obsession and urge to have a proper sex will lead to repeated trying and each time they fail because of the same basic reason.

After this, nothing else came out that day, but the nipple has remained larger on the left side, and occasionally (once every few days,) if I squeeze it, it will discharge a tiny bit more.  I cannot identify any lumps of any kind to indicate gynecomastia or breast cancer, and am really stumped/concerned as to what else could possibly be causing unilateral nipple discharge in a 22 year old male.","Doctor":"Dear, We understand your concernsI went through your details. A women can normally have some type of nipple discharge throughout her adult life. For men, nipple discharge can indicate a problem. During hormone imbalances such as adolescence, the male gland can be stimulated. This hormonal stimulation can result in gland growth (Gynecomastia), tenderness, and produce milk and or nipple discharge.If squeezed / traumatized enough, a clear fluid can be express from almost anyone. This is normal but hurting tissues this much is not a good idea.With gland stimulation, the discharge can be milk like or thick like a pimple.

Night fall (nocturnal ejaculation) is not due to excess masturbation. In fact, masturbation controls night fall. You should understand the process. Your body produces sperm cells and semen whenever it is sexually aroused. The produced semen is stored within your body and it is a waste product now. Body needs to throw the waste out. If you masturbate or engage in sex, the waste goes out. Otherwise, body finds its own way to expel the waste and the ways are through nocturnal ejaculation or through urine.Dark circles near eyes, loosening of cheeks etc are due to stress. Stress is due to anxiety which is caused by your wrong or insufficient knowledge about masturbation, sex, sexual organs and other aspects.

Erectile dysfunction and premature ejaculation are common for ''just married'' men and there is nothing to worry about. This happens because of the stress, anxiety and performance related anxeity. Men always want to perform ''outstandingly'' and satisfy their partner. This thought acts as an obsession and results in performance anxiety. You just have to wait for another couple of weeks. Do not try to ''overcome'' this problem forcefully. Because each time you forcefully try to overcome this problem, the situation worsens. Wait and watch.

I think the thought pattern and over excitement about performance are causing the troubles. Your penis length is enough. Even a 5 cm penis will be able to satisfy any woman across the world because the pleasure nerve endings are available only upto 5 cm within the female vagina. You donot have to try harder to satisfy any woman. Because thinking about satisfying your partner in itself triggers performance anxiety.

Average erect penis size is 4.5 inches. A small bend towards left or right on erection is common and is also a blessing because the tilt or bend penis will provide more friction within vagina and give more pleasure to both the partners than straight penis.

The substances which are released after smoking weed get in to your system and cause a feeling of pleasure in the brain. Continuing to smoke weed for a long time can cause problems with your brain, heart and lungs. Therefore the use of weed is restricted.The ultrasound scan shows that you have a hydrocele. This is a condition where there is fluid accumulation in the scrotal sac. This can be small or large in quantity. It is not related to smoking weed. However you should get treated if it is large and causing symptoms.Smoking weed can reduce pain temporarily but will not have any effect on the hydrocele.

The blood in urine can be from a cancer in the urinary bladder or prostate and this is causing the symptom. This might explain the bleeding from rectum which can happen if the tumor is invading the blood vessels in the rectal wall.The doctor to be consulted is a surgeon and preferable a urologist. They will do investigations like ultrasound scan and Ct scan of the abdomen and pelvis. If the bleeding area is not clear then he will require cystoscopy and colonoscopy which are minimally invasive techniques and help in confirming the diagnosis. The doctor should be consulted urgently. Please do not worry."},{"Patient":"I am a virgin, I mastrubate 3-10 times a day.

I don't usually have this problem around other people, but I will find that after a day or so I will need to sneek somewhere and pinch one out. Just the act of sneeking off to do it will get me stiff.  I am 21 years old, and I am pretty decensitized to all types of porn and anything else you can imagine.

This is a condition which is not always normal and masturbating 3 to 10 times a day means you should seek help.You can do the following to control excessive masturbation.(i) Read books when you get time(ii) Go out for short walks regularly(iii) Avoid sexual thoughts when alone and if such thoughts come then talk to a friend or listen to music.(iv) Do exercises in the evening and try to keep yourself fit(v) Keep yourself occupied in productive activities before sleeping like planning for the next day, making time for study or business work(vi) Do not touch your penis except when in the washroom and having bath(vii) Completely avoid pornography and at any timeThis is a rare condition where normal appearing objects cause erection and it is different from sex addiction because you have never had sex with a partner.

Most of these problems will be cleared when the time passes and when you get experienced.Erectile dysfunction (ED) or impotence is sexual dysfunction characterized by the inability to develop or maintain an erection of the penis during sexual activity. The most important organic causes are cardiovascular disease and diabetes, neurological problems (for example, trauma), hormonal insufficiencies (hypogonadism) and drug side effects.Psychological impotence is where erection or penetration fails due to thoughts or feelings (psychological reasons) rather than physical impossibility. First you should rule out the physical angle of ED. Please consult an urologist for investigation. Then, once that angle is cleared, you may consult a psychologist for counseling or further ED treatment.If you require more of my help in this aspect, please use this URL.  Make sure that you include every minute detail possible. Hope this answers your query.  Further clarifications are welcome.Good luck.

I have a question. I wish you could help me out please. From the last 1.5 months I had itching and redness on the glans and in the below end of glans. I m uncircumcised . And I masturbate almost twice everyday. My doctor gave me prulifoxacin 600mg for 5 days after which my redness and itching went away. I reckon it was Urinary Tract Infection. Later when the meds finished i masturbated, although the itch and redness were gone, the itch is sligthtly present like 5% of the whole. And Please note it only happens after masturbation rest of the time , its fine and it all disappears while the itch after masturbation is only for like 15 mins with a very very slight sensation of prick inside the penis and on the left side of the glans and some engorged red veins just for sometimes after masturbation and then its gone. I ve never had sexual relations yet but yes i admit i have alot alot alot of sexual thoughts across the day and that i stay erect numerous times in a day. The doc was unwilling to provide me any meds cuz i ve met two docs in the past and they said that i ve got mental stress and need psychiatrist. It s true a bit that i ve never been to school since 7th grade which i left challenging the principal and since then i ve completed and excelled in everything from school students and infact have defeated many teachers as well in knowledge despite of learning on my own at home. I ve immense and very hyper (above normal) enthusiasm in biology and especially in Microbiology. It may have been my half knowledge thats causing stress as i ve been stayin very afraid towards diseases but its certainly not OCD and due to recent outbreak of ebola even though there hasnt been a single case of it In India but im staying too precautious . I excercise everyday with dumbells and pushups . I listen music and don t like eating sweet much especially in the morning or as meal. Hence i cut tea from my daily schedule and only drink milk without sugar . I only like spicy hot, bitter and sour but sweet at its least. Recently i ve had abdominal pain below the left side of the ribcage (not the rear side) for six months which had gone for months but came back since yesterday and indigestion for 1.5 months which both the doctor say that s because of my overthinking. And yes last month i did a CBC in which everything was normal except. haemoglobin which was 0.5% less than normal but the docs said its not even a 1% matter of concern and infact i can donate blood with those levels and also my ultrasound i.e sonography (abdomen) reports were completely normal.

Or is it due to excessive masturbation (although i paused for 2 days but of no avail) and its weird but i ve been masturbating since the age of 5 (although no ejaculations till puberty) but it hasnt every happened before or is it due to overthinking as the docs said?

You don't have to take musli power. Instead you should consult a sexologist or psychologist for sexual counseling. If you require more of my help in this aspect, please use this URL.

You say that it is beyond normal. That is where you have to understand the normal shrinkage. As age advance, the penis actually shrinks. But that proportion is very minute.Shrinkage happens when the body pulls out blood from that part because some other part of your body needs more blood. Therefore the channelization. this is a natural procedure and you cannot control it. My suggestion would be you don't have to worry unless you have any sexual erection or ejaculation problems.

Dribbling of semen during evacuation procedure is quite normal process and there is nothing to worry about it. Your ADD problem is not to be linked with this dribbling.Your body produces semen whenever it is sexually excited. The produced semen is then stored within your body. The stored semen is a waste product. Your body will try to throw the waste product when it becomes excess.

It began maybe 6 hours ago.","Doctor":"DearWe understand your concernsI went through your details. Masturbation using soap can cause irritation to the soft skin of penis and this could cause momentary inflammation. Your red dots and burning sensation could be due to the inflammation.

Sometimes, I jerk off hard after thrusting for hours and still no cum. Am afraid I won t be able to have children if it continues like this. Is it because I started sex experience with masturbation before I started seeing people?","Doctor":"DearWe understand your concernsI went through your details. Please understand masturbation is never the cause of your present problem. Masturbation is healthy, normal and natural.Delayed ejaculation (DE) is a common medical condition. Also called “impaired ejaculation,” this condition occurs when it takes a prolonged period of sexual stimulation for a man to ejaculate. In some cases, ejaculation cannot be achieved at all. While this condition does not pose any serious medical risks, it can be a source of stress and may create problems in your sex life and personal relationships. You should consult an urologist to determine the basic facts regarding your DE. There could be many factors like damage to the nerves in your spine or pelvis, certain prostate surgeries that cause nerve damage, heart disease that affects blood pressure to the pelvic region, infections, especially prostate or urinary infections, neuropathy (nerve damage) or strokelow thyroid hormone, low testosterone levels, birth defects that impair the ejaculation process etcOnce the urologist determine the cause of your problem, the treatment starts and cure is sure.

The hard masturbation may have caused blockage to the lymphatic channels in the skin which is leading to this swelling. This prevents the normal fluid that goes back toward your body from making it to the body and leads to the swelling. Vigorous masturbation can cause this. As long as the swelling seems to be improving, I think you should be okay. As you said, it happens whenever you masturbates hard, the problem could be summarized as above. I would recommend that you try to put some warm compresses to the penis to try to get the lymphatic channels to open up to let the swelling go down. If it continues to get worse or does not go away in the next 2 to 3 days, then you should see a urologist as soon as possible.

I see that you are under treatment for schizophrenia. Even then there is minimum possibility of lack of ejaculation. Retrograde ejaculation , as its name implies, is a condition where the seminal fluid is ejaculated backward (retrograde) into the urinary bladder instead of forward. This usually occurs because the neck of the urinary bladder, which normally closes to block such retrograde flow, is unable to do so. Such inability usually results from neurological or physical damage to the bladder neck, which in turn can result from a variety of clinical conditions.

The condition you are mentioning here could be pretty Likely normal. Normal semen can be jelly-like or you may see grain like parts. But when you try to hold it with your fingers it slips off.

Please understand masturbation is not unhealthy, rather it is natural and normal activity. A person at your age can safely masturbate twice or thrice a week.

Thickness of semen is never a determining factor regarding your sperm health.May be, your such anxieties are the reason for your erectile dysfunction.

Please understand, hematospermia has nothing to do with masturbation. Seeing blood in the semen can make a man anxious. Fortunately, it doesn't always signal a major medical problem.

Night fall or nocturnal emission cannot give you any health problems or sexual problems in future or present. Nocturnal emissions are natural and is a process which you have very less control over. You must understand why this happens. Let me explain. Your body produces semen whenever you are sexually excited and stores it within the body. thus produced semen is a waste product and body will try to throw it out. If you do not masturbate or engage in sex, the waste cannot be expelled and therefore body's option is to expel it through nocturnal emission or through urination.

Blood in the semen is called hematospermia or hemospermia. Seeing blood in the semen can make a man anxious. Fortunately, it doesn't always signal a major medical problem. For men younger than 40 with no related symptoms and no risk factors for underlying medical conditions, blood in semen often disappears on its own.Blood in the semen can come from several different sources like infection, inflammation, prostrate problems, STDs, trauma of a medical procedure etc. As you mentioned, Physical trauma to the sex organs after pelvic fracture, injury to the testicles, excessively rigorous sexual activity or masturbation, or other injury can cause blood in the semen.

Semen is supposed to smell like chlorine and bleach. Semen contains ammonia and other sterile-smelling alkaloids and this is the reason why it smells like your store-bough cleanser. However, your semen may smell differently on different occasions as well. The smell of your ejaculate may also vary depending on other factors such as your overall health and medications. Men also sometimes find that their semen tends to smell strongly when they haven’t ejaculated for a long time. It also seems to depend on the quantity of the semen released during an orgasm. Poor personal hygene can result in foul smelling semen. The fish-like smell is an indication that a lot of smegma can be heaping up just under the penis head. Daily cleaning helps a lot. Foul smells are usually associated with infections of the prostrate gland or other organs of the male reproductive system. If the smell is accompanied with a change in color of the ejaculate to red, brown, yellow or green, you definitely have an infection.

Semen is a thick gel at the time of ejaculation and normally becomes liquid within 20 -30minutes after ejaculation. When semen is ejaculated, it is thick and gelatinous. This is to help it adhere to the cervix.  .The liquefaction is the process when the gel formed by proteins from the seminal vesicles is broken up and the semen becomes more liquid. The semen eventually liquefies to enable the sperm to swim better Liquefaction time is a measure of the time it takes for the semen to liquefy.Delayed liquefaction may indicate a problem with the prostate, the seminal vesicles, or the bulb urethral glands, which are also known as the male accessory glands.

Usually the size of breasts in boys are determined by the female hormone which is available at their body. In young ages, the breast size could be a little bit large and visible.

Thickness and color of semen depends on many aspects. The color, volume, and thickness of semen may change due to so many factors. What you eat, how many times you ejaculate, low sperm count, high temperature, body hydration etc are main factors which affects the thickness of semen.You need to understand that semen is off white or white in color. If your semen is red in color, it usually happens due to prostate problems. Green or yellow tinged semen usually indicate infections. If you notice a pronounced green or yellow color, it could be due to an STD called gonorrhea. Brown or bright red semen. It is mainly due to a burst blood vessel in your prostate. Your semen color should return to normal within a couple of days, but if that's not the case, you should visit your doctor because persistent blood in seminal fluid may result from trauma, infection, and even cancer.If you require more of my help in this aspect, please use this URL.

You said \\"when i masturbate semen doesnt come in urine till one week after that it comes in urine\\". That is natural. Semen is produced whenever you are sexually excited. Produced semen is stored inside your body. Stored semen is a waste product now and body needs to throw it out if it is in excess. When you masturbate, naturally, the stored semen is removed. If you do not masturbate for long, body needs to throw the stored semen. Therefore body find its own way either through urine or through nocturnal emission. Nothing to worry.

Thanks and regards Matt","Doctor":"DearWe understand your concernsI went through your details. You have not given your age here. Any size penis can provide great pleasure for the man it's attached to. An estimated 95 percent of penises are average size (3 to 5 inches flaccid, 5 to 7 inches erect). Very few are significantly larger or smaller. When women have been surveyed about what they want in a lover, they consistently mention attractiveness, kindness, caring, listening, sense of humor, and shared interests and values. Not the size of penis!Forget enlargement products. They are expensive and they are cynical frauds. There are certain natural ways to enhance size. Flaccid or erect, size depends on the amount of blood in the organ. Less blood means a smaller penis. Stop smoking, exercise regularly, Lose the pot belly, eat less meat and cheese, Embrace meditative relaxation and don't be anxious about penis size.

The process of ejaculation is separate from the erection process, erection being controlled by the pituitary gland. Men can ejaculate without an erection, but they can also ejaculate without orgasm (like during the night). As a rule, controlling ejaculation gets easier with age. Premature ejaculation is a frequent problem but not a serious one. It affects around 1 in 3 men, often young men. Sufferers ejaculate at the beginning of penetration and sometimes even before. Premature ejaculation often comes from a lack of control. Ejaculation is a result of an uncontrollable reflex that men with this problem cannot manage to delay to make the pleasure of sex last.

They include severe exzema, joint pain, reduced interest in sex, foul smelling semen, extreme tiredness, unable to sleep through out the night even with melatonin.","Doctor":"Eczema and joint pain are not related to sexual disinterest. However continuous insomnia and severity of joint pains may be connected due to interfering each other. This may, in some cases, cause lack of sexual enjoyment but it is not a rule.You should treat these separately in allopathy. However in Ayurveda 'vata' humor vitiation theory fits insomnia, joint pains, impotency etc but not skin as a general rule.In my own patients' cases I would treat them with mild purgation and Intestinal unctuousness, appetizers and nervine tonics like Ashwagandha herb and allied preparations. This would address joint pains, sexual lack and insomnia by combining food protocol and observing do's and dont's of diet.When nervine tonics added with 'dhatupaushtik' i.e. semen thickeners, the foul smell will go. For the time being a lot water should be given along with 'gokshura' and 'Kapikachhu' herbal capsules of Himalaya co.If you agree, may write direct question for further guidance and treatment. Alternatively you may meet any Ayurveda specialist to look into the case for your husband's benefit.

Hemorrhoids occur when the veins of the rectum or anus become inflamed because of too much straining in the area. I would suggest:1. Take NSAID like ibuprofen and paracetamol for pain.2.

Fill your bathtub with just enough warm water to cover the anal area. Do this several times a day, especially after you have had a bowel movement. Soak for about 15 minutes at a time. Be careful!

This all began in one night and suddenly, for the first time in my life, I have trouble getting and maintaining erections. Urologist had never heard of lymphocele and threw some viagra at me which helped but now I need such vigorous stimulation to maintain erections even viagra is failing. And it's expensive. Sometime the head of my penis tingles and stings. I do not get spontaineous erections anymore which I have had frequently as long as I can remember. I am 43 and went from rock hard anytime to struggling overnight and it started with a raised white tube popping out under the skin just behind the head. Any ideas what the white patches and loss of feeling could be? Only 1 partner last 18 years and can have frequent vigorous sex. Seems to be getting worse with time.","Doctor":"Your story prompts me to do something for you. Sildenafin does have bad effects if used indiscriminately which you have observed now.Numbness and erectile inability of penis can be addressed by herbals under a set protocol if using these with some food instructions and local applications.The whole idea is to strengthen corpora cavernosa and penile blood vessels. If these fill properly, the erect penis will be as stout as of a young person. Then comes the role of sexual act having broadly four stages in an intercourse cycle viz. Foreplay, Intromission, Orgasm and Resolution. The technical perfection is your own and your partners experience. To sustain the act for long, some herbal aphrodisiacs, known to nourish seven elements including Semen ( as per Ayurveda principles), play an important role. White pathes can be addressed by local Ayurveda applications made of oils and herbs (to cure skin) which is used before starting the use of aphrodisiacs oil for vessels and cavernous spaces strengthening.Some herbominerals which are nervine tonics, removes numbness and tones up nerves that additionally helps in maintaining stout penis upon erection.But this cycle needs at least 7 weeks. Some metabolic, digestive factors may extend duration of treatment.Hope you understand that herbals and Ayurveda are natural answer to your problem. It is side effects less treatment, safe but slow being naturals and not synthetic and toxic. But its effect sustains and not temporary.

I also noticed that my penis had a semi hard erection with a little loss of feeling at the base and also didn t stay up but stayed hard.

Means: Avoid the cause.Compression should be removed - by physio, by medicine which strengthen muscles/ nerves to counter pain, to avoid degeneration etc.,  by surgical methods etc.Surgery should be the last resort.Nerve damage already done is little difficult to recover. Yoga, deep breathing, some herbomineral Ayurvedic Medicines may help  recovery. But not much studies are scientifically documented.Initially Harsingar plant leaves' decoction (night Jasmine), if used orally  for few weeks will show dramatic changes. That's what we give to our patients in India. Some other medicines which are permissible in India like yogender rasa and Brihat Vata Chintamani Rasa etc, nux vomica based Vishtinduk vati, muscle strengthening by Mahavishgarbh and Mahanarayan Ayurvedic Oil maasage and hot fomentation thereon have been used successfully in Indian Ayurveda institutes to correct such problems.Similarly erection related problems may be addressed by particular local penile applications.

Sexually Transmitted diseases are of many kind including Chlamydia, Gonorrhea, Hepatitis B etc. Each one of them having different symptoms and some of them may be common symptoms. Many men are quick to assume that if they had a sexually transmitted disease (STD), they would know it. While most STDs do cause symptoms, many are easily mistaken for other conditions. In some cases there are no symptoms at all. The symptoms of an initial infection can include:Fever and flu-like symptoms.Genital itching, burning, or discomfort.Swollen lymph nodes.A feeling of pressure in the abdomen.In your case, sore mouth does not indicate any STDs. But Both primary and secondary syphilis can show up on your face, and this usually happens by having oral sex with someone with genital lesions. Primary syphilis of the face will usually appear on the lips as a large, open sore. Sores may also be present on the tongue or inside the mouth. Secondary syphilis can have a range of symptoms. Some raised bumps may appear in-and-around the mouth, a reddish rash may appear all over the body and the infected person may even suffer abnormal hair loss (alopecia). Secondary symptoms are also likely to arise from infection due to genital sex, not just oral, as well.I suggest you to consult a physician for further follow up.

You could be obsessing with the pop sound you had while having first sex, and that makes you anxious and anxiety triggers the physical mechanisms.

Delayed ejaculation — sometimes called impaired ejaculation — is a condition in which it takes an extended period of sexual stimulation for a man to reach sexual climax and release semen from the penis (ejaculate).Possible causes of delayed ejaculation include certain chronic health conditions, surgeries and medications.

I am now starting to realize this is due to the fact that I have been masterbaiting since I was like 4, since like October of 2014 I noticed my balls have shrunk a lot and a little after, I noticed my index finger trembling. I,ve continued masterbaiting ( I know, I know but it is difficult) since then and my balls have shrunk more and my trembling (tremors) have worsened onto my hands and legs, arms, still mild though, with anxiety it is a little obvious or if I drink coffee but when calm its not noticable, oh and my balls have shrunk even more. Originally I thought it was essential tremors and it could be but I read that tremors are a symptom over masterbation. The few times that I,be stopped for like a week or two I was able to get errections, my concentration improved a little. I don t know this is starting effect me, I need help.","Doctor":"DearWe understand your concernsI went through your details. I can understand your emotions. But let me assure you, masturbation is not unhealthy and cannot cause any problems as you suspect. Masturbation is a natural process and even animals masturbate. I think your knowledge about these issues are making you anxious. The tremors are the sign of obsessive thinking which came out of your anxiety. Shrinking testicles is not at all a possibility. It never shrinks in size, but the skin around it could shrink or become lucid depending on many conditions like stress, water availability in your body etc. I suggest you to understand the basics of masturbation.
