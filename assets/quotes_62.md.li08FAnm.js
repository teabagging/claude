However, in the realm of numbers, for any positive number, you can always find a smaller positive number (for example, half of it), and similarly, for any negative number, you can find a larger negative number (closer to zero). Therefore, the statement that there is a \\"smallest positive number\\" or \\"largest negative number\\" is incorrect.

The absolute value of a number is its distance from 0 on the number line, without considering which direction from 0 it lies. Since 0 is at the point of reference itself, its absolute value is indeed the smallest possible, which is 0. Therefore, option B correctly identifies a fundamental property of numbers and meets the requirements.- Option C: This option suggests that positive and negative numbers are collectively referred to as rational numbers. However, rational numbers are defined as numbers that can be expressed as the quotient or fraction of two integers, where the denominator is not zero.

After deciding to split the inequality into three inequalities using the arithmetic-geometric mean (one for x y, one for y z, and one for x z), there are different ways to find the coefficients for frac{1}{x}, frac{1}{y}, and frac{1}{z}. First, you can be guided by examples you have found in your search for the equality case. For example, the expression equals 10 for (x, y, z)=left(frac{2}{3}, 1,2right), and with (x, y, z)=left(frac{3}{5}, frac{9}{10}, frac{9}{5}right), you get frac{324}{100}+frac{12}{18} cdot 10=3.24+6.6666 ldots=9.9066 ldots.A more structured approach is to introduce variables a, b, c, d, e, f for the inequalities on x y+a frac{1}{x}+b frac{1}{y}, y z+c frac{1}{y}+d frac{1}{z}, and z x+e frac{1}{z}+f frac{1}{x}. Since these three terms must add up to the desired expressions, we get the conditionsbegin{aligned}f+a & =1, b+c & =2, d+e & =5 .end{aligned}Furthermore, we want equality to hold for certain x, y, and z. So the systembegin{aligned}& x y=a frac{1}{x}=b frac{1}{y} & y z=c frac{1}{y}=d frac{1}{z} & z x=e frac{1}{z}=f frac{1}{x}end{aligned}must have a solution for some x, y, and z. From the first equation, it follows that frac{x}{y}=frac{a}{b}. But using the last two equations, we can also write this asfrac{x}{y}=frac{z x}{y z}=frac{f / x}{c / y}=frac{f y}{c x} .This means that frac{f}{c}=frac{x^{2}}{y^{2}}=frac{a^{2}}{b^{2}}, or a^{2} / f=b^{2} / c. Similarly, c^{2} / b=d^{2} / e and e^{2} / d=f^{2} / a hold. Together with f+a=1, b+c=2, and d+e=5, we now have six equations in six variables. Although it is not easy to solve this system, it greatly simplifies the search because it is now easy to check whether a, b, c, d, e, f satisfy the conditions.

It is clear that A_n = 1 because the only permutation with no lifters is the descending order (n, n-1, ldots, 1).3. Calculate B_n:   To find B_n, we consider permutations with at most 1 lifter. For each element k in {1, 2, ldots, n}, we can choose k in A or k in B. There are 2^n - 2 possible choices where both A and B are non-empty. We write the elements in A in descending order, followed by elements in B in descending order. This permutation has at most 1 lifter (at the interface of A and B).   Each permutation with 1 lifter can be uniquely constructed by cutting off at the lifter. The permutation with no lifter would be constructed n-1 times (by cutting off at any position). Therefore, we have:   [   2^n - 2 = (n-1)A_n + B_n   ]   Since A_n = 1, we get:   [   2^n - 2 = (n-1) + B_n implies B_n = 2^n - (n + 1)   ]4.

By the inclusion-exclusion principle, there are 3^n - 3 cdot 2^n + 3 possible choices where A, B, and C are non-empty. We write the elements in A in descending order, followed by elements in B in descending order, followed by elements in C in descending order. This permutation has at most 2 lifters (at the interfaces of A and B, and B and C).   Each permutation with 2 lifters can be uniquely constructed by cutting off at the two lifters. The permutation with 1 lifter would be constructed n-2 times (by cutting off at the lifter and another position). The permutation with no lifter would be constructed binom{n-1}{2} times (by cutting off at any two positions). Therefore, we have:   [   3^n - 3 cdot 2^n + 3 = binom{n-1}{2}A_n + (n-2)B_n + C_n   ]   Plugging in A_n = 1 and B_n = 2^n - (n + 1), we get:   [   3^n - 3 cdot 2^n + 3 = frac{(n-1)n}{2} + (n-2)(2^n - (n + 1)) + C_n   ]   Simplifying, we get:   [   3^n - 3 cdot 2^n + 3 = frac{n^2 - n}{2} + (n-2)(2^n - n - 1) + C_n   ]   [   3^n - 3 cdot 2^n + 3 = frac{n^2 - n}{2} + (n-2)2^n - (n-2)(n+1) + C_n   ]   [   3^n - 3 cdot 2^n + 3 = frac{n^2 - n}{2} + (n-2)2^n - n^2 + 1 + C_n   ]   [   3^n - 3 cdot 2^n + 3 = (n-2)2^n - frac{n^2 - n}{2} + 1 + C_n   ]   [   C_n = 3^n - (n+1)2^n + frac{n(n+1)}{2}   ]5.

Let  A_i  denote the set of locks that the  i -th member of the committee can open, where  i = 1, 2, ldots, 11 , and let  A  denote the set of all locks. Then from the conditions of the problem, we havefor any five-element subset  { i_1, ldots, i_5}  of the set  {1, 2, ldots, 11}  andfor any six-element subset  {j_1, ldots, j_6}  of the set  {1,2,ldots,  11} .From (1), it follows that the set  A - (A_{i_1} cup ldots cup A_{i_5})  is non-empty. Let  x_{i_1}, ldots, x_{i_5}  be one of its elements, i.e., a lock that the group of committee members numbered  i_1, ldots, i_5  cannot open. From (2), it follows that for every  j not in {i_1, ldots, i_5 }  we have  x_{i_1 , ldots, i_5} in A_j .Suppose that  x_{i_1,ldots,i_5} = x_{k_1, ldots, k_5}  for some subsets  {i_1, ldots, i_5}  and  {k_1, ldots, k_5} . If these subsets were different, then, for example,  i_t not in { k_1, ldots, k_5 } . Therefore,  x_{k_1, ldots, k_5} in A_{i_t} ; but on the other hand, this leads to a contradiction. The obtained contradiction proves that  {i_1, ldots,i_5} = { k_1, ldots, k_5 } .In other words, different five-element subsets  {i_1, ldots, i_5}  correspond to different locks. Therefore, the number of locks is not less than the number of five-element subsets of an 11-element set, i.e.,  n geq  binom{11}{5} = 462 .We will now prove that if we install   binom{11}{5}  locks on the treasury, then we can distribute the keys to them among the members of the 11-member committee in such a way that the conditions of the problem are satisfied.Let us associate each of the   binom{11}{5}  locks with a five-element subset of the set  {1, 2, ldots, 11}  in a one-to-one manner. If a lock corresponds to the subset  {i_1, ldots, i_5} , then the keys to it are given to all members of the committee whose numbers are different from  i_1, ldots, i_5 .We will show that no five members of the committee can open a certain lock, and therefore the treasury. Indeed, the members of the committee numbered  i_1, ldots, i_5  do not have the key to the lock corresponding to the subset  {i_1, ldots, i_5} .We will show that any six members of the committee can open any lock, and therefore the treasury. If the members of the committee have numbers  j_1, ldots, j_6  and want to open a lock corresponding to the subset  {i_1, ldots, i_5} , then one of the six numbers  j_1, ldots, j_6  does not belong to this five-element subset, say  j_t not in {i_1, ldots, i_5 } . Therefore, the member of the committee numbered  j_t  has the key to the lock corresponding to the subset  {i_1, ldots, i_5} .Thus, the smallest number satisfying the conditions of the problem is   binom{11}{5} = 462 ."},{"problem":"29 cdot 25 Determine the largest positive integer n such that 1005! is divisible by 10^n.(A) 102.(B) 112.(C) 249.(D) 502.(E) None of these.(28th American High School Mathematics Examination, 1977)","solution":"[Solution] If 2^{k} 3^{l} 5^{m} cdots is the factorization of 1005! into powers of distinct primes, then n=min {k, m}.Now there are 201 integers between 5 and 1005 that are divisible by 5; among these 201 integers, 40 are divisible by 5^{2}; among these 40 integers, 8 are divisible by 5^{3}; among these 8 integers, 1 is divisible by 5^{4}.Thus, m=201+40+8+1=250.Also,k>left[frac{1005}{2}right]=502 text {, }Therefore,n=min {k, m}=250 text {. }Hence, the answer is (E)."},{"problem":"Given the line l_1: y = -frac{3}{2}x + b is tangent to the parabola x^2 = -frac{16}{3}y at point P.

Hence the integral over S is just A. The locus of points a distance z from S is a set of segments parallel to the sides of P and displaced a distance z outwards, together with a set of arcs joining them. Each arc is centered on a vertex of P and has radius z. Together the arcs can be translated to form a complete circle radius z. Thus the set of points a distance z to z + δz from S is a strip of area p δz + 2πz δz. Thus the integral outside S is just ∫ 0 ∞ exp( - z) (p + 2πz) dz.

Reduction Modulo 10: First, consider the congruence modulo 10:   [   a^7 equiv b^7 pmod{10}   ]   Since ( gcd(a, 10) = 1 ) and ( gcd(b, 10) = 1 ), both ( a ) and ( b ) are nonzero digits from 1 to 9. Therefore, we have:   [   a equiv b pmod{10}   ]4. Lifting the Congruence: Now, we lift the congruence to modulo ( 10^7 ). Since ( a equiv b pmod{10} ), let ( a = b + 10k ) for some integer ( k ). Then:   [   a^7 = (b + 10k)^7   ]   Expanding using the binomial theorem:   [   (b + 10k)^7 = b^7 + 7b^6(10k) + binom{7}{2}b^5(10k)^2 + cdots + (10k)^7   ]   Since ( 10^7 ) is a large power, all terms involving ( 10k ) raised to any power greater than or equal to 1 will be divisible by ( 10^7 ). Thus:   [   (b + 10k)^7 equiv b^7 pmod{10^7}   ]   Given ( a^7 equiv b^7 pmod{10^7} ), we conclude:   [   a equiv b pmod{10^7}   ]5. Conclusion of Injectivity: This shows that if ( a^7 equiv b^7 pmod{10^7} ), then ( a equiv b pmod{10^7} ). Hence, the mapping ( k mapsto k^7 ) is injective modulo ( 10^7 ).6. Bijection and Septic Residues: Since the mapping is injective and the domain is finite, it is also bijective. This implies that every residue relatively prime to 10 is a septic residue modulo ( 10^7 ).7. Game Strategy: Alice and Bob alternate picking digits from 1 to 9. Alice can always ensure that the final digit ( A_7 ) is one of ( {1, 3, 5, 7, 9} ), which are all relatively prime to 10. Since there are 5 such digits and Bob only has 3 moves, Alice can always pick a digit that ensures the resulting number is a septic residue modulo ( 10^7 ).8. Conclusion: Alice has a winning strategy because she can always ensure the final number is a septic residue modulo ( 10^7 ).The final answer is (boxed{text{Alice}})"},{"problem":"Which of the following sets of four line segments a, b, c, d are in proportion?A: a=4, b=6, c=5, d=10B: a=1, b=2, c=3, d=4C: a=sqrt{2}, b=3, c=2, d=sqrt{3}D: a=2, b=sqrt{5}, c=2sqrt{3}, d=sqrt{15}","solution":"To determine which set of four line segments a, b, c, d are in proportion, we check each option by verifying if a times d = b times c.Option A: For a=4, b=6, c=5, d=10, we calculate:4 times 10 = 40 quad text{and} quad 6 times 5 = 30Since 40 neq 30, option A does not meet the requirements.Option B: For a=1, b=2, c=3, d=4, we calculate:1 times 4 = 4 quad text{and} quad 2 times 3 = 6Since 4 neq 6, option B does not meet the requirements.Option C: For a=sqrt{2}, b=3, c=2, d=sqrt{3}, we calculate:sqrt{2} times sqrt{3} = sqrt{6} quad text{and} quad 2 times 3 = 6Since sqrt{6} neq 6, option C does not meet the requirements.Option D: For a=2, b=sqrt{5}, c=2sqrt{3}, d=sqrt{15}, we calculate:2 times sqrt{15} = 2sqrt{15} quad text{and} quad sqrt{5} times 2sqrt{3} = 2sqrt{15}Since 2sqrt{15} = 2sqrt{15}, option D meets the requirements.Therefore, the set of line segments that are in proportion is:boxed{D}"},{"problem":"Calculate: 6div left(-3right)+2^{2}times left(1-4right).","solution":"To calculate 6div left(-3right)+2^{2}times left(1-4right), we follow these steps:1.

Solution","solution":": the other roots are -1/(α+1) and - (α+1)/α. Let the roots of p(x) be α, β, γ. The polynomial q(x+1) has α as one of its roots. Suppose it is different from p(x). Then by subtracting we get either a quadratic or a linear equation which also has α as a root. It cannot be a linear equation, because then α would be rational and hence p(x) would not be irreducible over the rationals. If it was quadratic, then by multiplying it by a suitable rational factor rx + s and subtracting from p(x) we would get a linear factor ux + v which also had α as a root. If this factor is zero, then we have reduced p(x) over the rationals (as (rx + s) times the quadratic). If not, then α is a root of ux + v and hence rational, so that p(x) is still reducible. So we must have that p(x) and q(x+1) are identical. So the three roots of q(x) must be α+1, β+1, γ+1. Hence we have the relations: αβγ = 1, (α+1)(β+1)(γ+1) = -1 (derived from the constant terms of p(x) and q(x) respectively). Hence α(β+γ)+(β+γ)+α+1+βγ+αβγ = -1, so (β+γ)(α+1) = - (3+α+1/α), or β+γ = - (3α+α 2 +1) / ( α(α+1) ). Hence (β-γ) 2 = (β+γ) 2 - 4βγ = (α 4 +2α 3 +3α 2 +2α+1)/ ( α 2 (α+1) 2 ).

The possible distributions are:   - 1 jellybean of color (A) and 4 jellybeans of color (B)   - 2 jellybeans of color (A) and 3 jellybeans of color (B)   - 3 jellybeans of color (A) and 2 jellybeans of color (B)   - 4 jellybeans of color (A) and 1 jellybean of color (B)   For each distribution, we calculate the number of ways to arrange the jellybeans:   - For 1 jellybean of color (A) and 4 jellybeans of color (B):     [     binom{5}{1} = 5     ]   - For 2 jellybeans of color (A) and 3 jellybeans of color (B):     [     binom{5}{2} = 10     ]   - For 3 jellybeans of color (A) and 2 jellybeans of color (B):     [     binom{5}{3} = 10     ]   - For 4 jellybeans of color (A) and 1 jellybean of color (B):     [     binom{5}{4} = 5     ]   Summing these, the total number of ways to distribute the jellybeans into 2 colors is:   [   5 + 10 + 10 + 5 = 30   ]3. Calculate the total number of possible sequences of 5 jellybeans:   Since there are 5 colors and each jellybean can be any of the 5 colors, the total number of possible sequences of 5 jellybeans is:   [   5^5 = 3125   ]4. Calculate the probability:   The probability of getting exactly 2 distinct colors in a sample of 5 jellybeans is the ratio of the number of favorable outcomes to the total number of possible outcomes:   [   frac{text{Number of favorable outcomes}}{text{Total number of possible outcomes}} = frac{10 times 30}{5^5} = frac{300}{3125} = frac{12}{125}   ]The final answer is (boxed{frac{12}{125}})."},{"problem":"Given that a, b, and c are the three side lengths of triangle ABC, and b and c satisfy left(b-5right)^{2}+left(c-7right)^{2}=0, a is a solution of the equation |a-3|=2.

Understanding the Problem:   We need to find the maximum possible area of the orthogonal projection (shadow) of a cube with side length 1 when the sun is at its peak. This means we are looking for the largest possible area of the shadow of the cube on a plane.2. Simplifying the Problem:   Consider a cube with side length 1. The cube has 6 faces, each with an area of 1. When the sun is directly overhead, the shadow of the cube on the ground is the orthogonal projection of the cube onto the plane.3. Projection of the Cube:   The orthogonal projection of a cube onto a plane can vary depending on the orientation of the cube. The maximum shadow area occurs when the projection is maximized.4. Choosing a Vertex and Adjacent Faces:   Let's pick a vertex ( P ) of the cube and consider the three faces that meet at ( P ). These faces are adjacent and form a corner of the cube. The projection of these three faces will give us an insight into the maximum shadow area.5. Analyzing the Projection:   The three faces adjacent to vertex ( P ) can be considered as forming a tetrahedron ( PABC ), where ( A, B, ) and ( C ) are the vertices adjacent to ( P ). The shadow of the remaining three faces is double the surface area of the tetrahedron ( PABC ).6. Calculating the Area of the Triangle ( triangle ABC ):   The area of ( triangle ABC ) can be calculated as follows:   [   text{Area of } triangle ABC = frac{1}{2} times text{base} times text{height}   ]   Since ( A, B, ) and ( C ) are vertices of the cube, the length of each side of ( triangle ABC ) is ( sqrt{2} ) (diagonal of a face of the cube).7.

Rewrite the recurrence relation:   The given recurrence relation is:   [   a_{n+1} = 5 + 6 + cdots + a_n   ]   This can be rewritten using the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series:   [   a_{n+1} = sum_{k=5}^{a_n} k = frac{(a_n - 4)(a_n + 5)}{2}   ]   Therefore, we have:   [   2a_{n+1} = (a_n - 4)(a_n + 5)   ]2.

Analyzing the sign of g'(x):- For x > 1, g'(x) > 0, indicating g(x) is increasing.- For 0  3 or a > 1 for x > 0.Step 2: Analyze f(x) for x leq 0For x leq 0, we have f(x) = 2^{x+1} - a = 0. Solving for a gives us a = 2^{x+1}. Since 2^{x+1} is monotonically increasing for x leq 0, there can only be one real root in this interval.Step 3: Combine Conditions for Exactly 3 ZerosGiven that f(x) has exactly 3 zeros:- From the analysis for x > 0, we need a > 1 to ensure two real roots.- From the analysis for x leq 0, we need a leq 2 to ensure one real root.Combining these conditions, we find that the range of a for which f(x) has exactly 3 zeros is 1 < a leq 2.Therefore, the range of real number a is boxed{(1,2]}."},{"problem":"Solve the equationsqrt{x+3-4 sqrt{x-1}}+sqrt{x+8-6 sqrt{x-1}}=1","solution":"SolutionWe havebegin{aligned}sqrt{x+3-4 sqrt{x-1}}+sqrt{x+8-6 sqrt{x-1}} & =sqrt{(sqrt{x-1}-2)^{2}}+sqrt{(sqrt{x-1}-3)^{2}} & =|sqrt{x-1}-2|+|sqrt{x-1}-3|end{aligned}Since the distance between 2 and 3 is 1, we can only have |sqrt{x-1}-2|+|sqrt{x-1}-3|=1 when sqrt{x-1} lies between these two numbers, that is,2 leq sqrt{x-1} leq 3This is equivalent to 4 leq x-1 leq 9.

Instead of the verification, it is sufficient to check that for the found x, all the squared expressions are non-negative, i.e., essentially just thatp^2 - 2x - 3 = frac{(p^2 - 3)(p^2 + 3)}{2p^2} geq 0.For p geq sqrt{3}, this is indeed the case.For a complete solution, award 6 points.

An indecomposable permutation is one that cannot be split into two non-empty subsequences such that each subsequence is a permutation of the original sequence.Given the problem, we need to find the number of such permutations for ( n = 7 ).1. Understanding the Decomposition:   Every permutation can be uniquely decomposed into a maximal indecomposable part followed by some other permutation. For example:   - For the permutation ( 1423756 ), the decomposition is ( 1 - 423756 ).   - For the permutation ( 2431756 ), the decomposition is ( 2431 - 756 ).   - For the permutation ( 7562431 ), the decomposition is ( 7562431 - emptyset ).2. Formulating the Recurrence:   Let ( a_i ) be the number of indecomposable permutations of length ( i ). The total number of permutations of length ( n ) is ( n! ). We can express this as:   [   n! = sum_{i=1}^n a_i cdot (n - i)!   ]   This equation states that the total number of permutations of length ( n ) is the sum of the number of ways to choose an indecomposable permutation of length ( i ) and then permute the remaining ( n - i ) elements.3.

The equation of the line can be expressed as y=k(x+2), which can be rearranged to kx-y+2k=0.The distance d from the center O to the line l is given by the formula d = frac{|ax_0+by_0+c|}{sqrt{a^2+b^2}}, where a, b, and c are the coefficients of the line equation ax+by+c=0 and (x_0, y_0) is a point on the line.

Case ( n = 5 ):   - Suppose ( A_1, A_2, A_3, A_4, A_5 ) form a convex pentagon.   - For a convex pentagon, the sum of the areas of the triangles formed by any three points must be consistent with the given condition.   - If ( A_1, A_2, A_3, A_4, A_5 ) form a convex pentagon, then ( r_i + r_{i+2} ) must be the same for all ( i ) (indices modulo 5).   - This implies that all ( r_i ) are equal, say ( r_i = r ) for all ( i ).   - However, this leads to a contradiction because the area of ( triangle A_1 A_2 A_3 ) cannot be equal to the area of ( triangle A_1 A_2 A_5 ), as the latter includes a different set of points.   - Therefore, ( n = 5 ) is impossible.3. Case ( n > 5 ):   - If ( n > 5 ), then we can always find a subset of 5 points among the ( n ) points.   - Since ( n = 5 ) is impossible, any ( n > 5 ) is also impossible.Conclusion:- The only integer ( n > 3 ) for which there exist ( n ) points ( A_1, A_2, ldots, A_n ) in the plane, no three collinear, and real numbers ( r_1, r_2, ldots, r_n ) such that for ( 1 leq i < j < k leq n ), the area of ( triangle A_i A_j A_k ) is ( r_i + r_j + r_k ), is ( n = 4 ).The final answer is ( boxed{ n = 4 } )."},{"problem":"The necessary and sufficient condition for the proposition \\"forall xin left[-2,1right], ax^{2}+2ax lt 1-3a\\" to be true is ( ).A: a≤frac{1}{6}B: a＜frac{1}{6}C: a≤frac{1}{3}D: a＜frac{1}{3}","solution":"To solve the given problem, we first need to establish the condition under which the proposition \\"forall x in [-2,1], ax^2 + 2ax  0 for all x, which means the quadratic expression is always positive within the given interval.

First, note that each face of the cube can be thought of as a plane that extends infinitely in all directions. However, for our purposes, we're only interested in the portion of the space that is relevant to the cube.2. The cube has 6 faces, and each face's plane will divide space into two parts - the space on one side of the plane and the space on the other.3. Now, let's think about how these planes intersect. Initially, we have the space outside the cube which is one part. As we add the first plane (or the first face of the cube), it divides the space into two parts.4. As we add the second plane, there are a few possibilities. If it is parallel to the first, it wouldn't intersect with the first, and we would just have two more parts (one on either side of the new plane). However, the planes on a cube are perpendicular to each other. So, when the second plane corresponds to the second face of the cube, it will intersect the first plane along a line and divide each of the existing parts into two, resulting in four parts so far.5. As we continue this process with the third plane (the third face of the cube that is perpendicular to the other two), the situation becomes three-dimensional. The third plane would intersect the first two planes along two lines, creating intersections in space and further dividing each part into two. This gives us a total of 8 parts before considering the interior of the cube.6. Thus far, we've only considered the outer space of the cube. However, there is one part of the space that is inside the cube, which we must add to our count.7. Additionally, each face of the cube not only divides external space but also intersects with the other faces to partition the interior of the cube. Each edge of the cube creates a new section within the cube, and each corner where three faces meet creates even smaller sections.8. To conclude, we need to add all the sections created by these intersections, both external and internal to the cube:   - 1 part inside the cube.   - 6 parts directly outside each face of the cube.   - 12 parts around the edges of the cube (each edge has one part outside the cube that isn't directly adjacent to any face).   - 8 parts around the vertices of the cube (each corner has one part that is outside all of the faces and edges).Adding them up yields 1 (inner) + 6 (faces) + 12 (edges) + 8 (vertices) = 27 parts in total.So the planes formed by the faces of the cube divide space into boxed{27} parts."},{"problem":"In triangle ABC, BC=AB, angle ABC=120^{circ}, find the eccentricity of the hyperbola with foci at A and B and passes through point C.","solution":"From the given information, we know that AB=2c, and in triangle ABC, BC=AB, angle ABC=120^{circ}.

Apply the formula to the given problem:   - Here, ( m_1 = M ) and ( m_2 = M + m ).   - Substitute these values into the tension formula:     [     T = frac{2M(M + m)g}{M + (M + m)} = frac{2M(M + m)g}{2M + m}     ]4. Simplify the expression:   - The tension ( T ) can be rewritten as:     [     T = 2Mg cdot frac{M + m}{2M + m}     ]5. Analyze the behavior of ( T ) as ( m ) increases:   - When ( m ) is very small (approaching 0), the expression simplifies to:     [     T approx 2Mg cdot frac{M}{2M} = Mg     ]     which matches the given condition that ( T = Mg ) when ( m = 0 ).   - When ( m ) increases to infinity, the term ( 2M ) in the denominator becomes negligible compared to ( m ):     [     T approx 2Mg cdot frac{m}{m} = 2Mg     ]     Thus, as ( m ) approaches infinity, ( T ) approaches ( 2Mg ).6. Conclusion:   - The tension ( T ) increases and approaches a finite constant value of ( 2Mg ) as ( m ) increases to infinity.The final answer is ( boxed{D} )"},{"problem":"Problem 2.

Let the centers of the first six spheres be A, B, ldots, F (in the order in which they form a hexagon), and the plane of the hexagon be alpha; the center of sphere S (i.e., the center of the hexagon) be O, and its radius be r; the center of sphere P be Z, and its desired radius be z.First, we find the radius of sphere S. For this, consider the cross-section of the construction by the plane alpha (Fig. 16a). The point of tangency of S with the sphere centered at A - let's denote this point as A_{1} - lies on the line O A. Since A A_{1}=1 and O A_{1}=r, then O A=r-1. On the other hand, from the properties of a regular hexagon, it is clear that triangles A O B, B O C, ldots, F O A are equilateral, i.e., O A=A B=2. We get r=3.Now consider sphere P. From its tangency with the six spheres, it follows that the distances from Z to points A, B, ldots, F are all 1+z. This means that Z lies on the perpendicular to alpha passing through O (indeed, from the equality of distances, it follows that points Z and O lie on the perpendicular bisectors of segments A D and B E, so the line Z O is perpendicular to lines A D and B E, and hence to the plane containing them). This perpendicular is the line of centers of spheres S and P, so their point of tangency - let's denote it as X - also lies on it.

Let N denote the number of distinct sets S_{pi} as pi ranges over all such permutations. Determine, in terms of n, the maximum value of N over all possible values of a_{1}, ldots, a_{n}.","solution":"Answer: 2^{n}-nSolution: The answer is 2^{n}-n.Let D=left(d_{i j}right) be the matrix where d_{i j} is 1 if i is a divisor of a_{j} and 0 otherwise. For a subset S of [n], let D_{S} be the matrix obtained from D by flipping (0 leftrightarrow 1) every entry d_{i j} where j notin S. Observe that S=S_{pi} if and only if left(D_{S}right)_{pi(i) i}=1 for all i.To show that N leq 2^{n}-n we consider two cases. If all the rows of D are distinct, then there exist n different possibilities for S that set a row equal to zero. In this case, there is clearly no pi so that S_{pi}=S. Thus there are at most 2^{n}-n possible S_{pi}. Otherwise, if two rows in D are the same, then choose an S_{0} such that D_{S_{0}} has two zero rows. Then, the n+1 sets S that are at most \\"one element away\\" from S_{0} are such that D_{S} only has one column with nonzero entries in those two rows. This makes it impossible for S_{pi}=S as well, so N leq 2^{n}-n-1.Now we construct N=2^{n}-n by setting a_{j}=j. By Hall's marriage theorem, it suffices to prove the following:Assuming that D_{S} has no completely-zero rows, given a set I=left{i_{1}, i_{2}, ldots, i_{k}right} there exist at least k values of j so that there exists an i in I so that left(D_{S}right)_{i j}=1. Call such j admissible.Without loss of generality assume i_{1}<i_{2}<cdots<i_{k}.Note that if left{d_{i j} mid i in Iright}={0,1}, then j is admissible. Therefore the k-1 numbers i_{1}, i_{2}, ldots, i_{k-1} are admissible, since for alpha<k, i_{alpha} divides i_{alpha} but i_{k} does not. So we only need to find one more admissible j. Assume that i_{k} is not admissible; now it must be the case that all the i_{alpha} are divisors of i_{k}.At this point we note that the k=1 case is easy, since no row of D_{S} is zero. Moreover, if k=2, left{left(D_{S}right)_{i_{1} i_{1}},left(D_{S}right)_{i_{2} i_{1}}right}={0,1}, so in the row with the zero there must be 1 somewhere, yielding a second admissible column.In the case where k geq 3, note that i_{1} leq i_{k} / 3. Therefore i_{k}-i_{1} notin I, but i_{1} divides i_{k}-i_{1} and i_{k} does not. Thus we have found the last admissible column. Having exhausted all cases, we are done."},{"problem":"In a simple graph with 300 vertices no two vertices of the same degree are adjacent (boo hoo hoo). What is the maximal possible number of edges in such a graph?","solution":"1. Understanding the Problem:   We are given a simple graph with 300 vertices where no two vertices of the same degree are adjacent. We need to find the maximal possible number of edges in such a graph.2. Claim:   The maximal possible number of edges is given by:   [   frac{1}{2} (299 + 298 cdot 2 + cdots + 276 cdot 24) = 42550   ]3. Proof of Bound:   - We need to show that we can have at most ( k ) vertices with degree ( 300 - k ).   - Consider the degrees of the vertices. Since no two vertices of the same degree are adjacent, the vertices with the same degree must form an independent set.   - The maximum degree a vertex can have is 299 (since there are 300 vertices in total).   - If we have ( k ) vertices with degree ( 300 - k ), then these vertices form an independent set, and thus, they do not contribute to each other's degree.4. Summing the Degrees:   - We need to sum the degrees of all vertices to find the total number of edges.   - The sum of the degrees of the vertices is given by:     [     sum_{k=1}^{24} k cdot (300 - k)     ]   - This is because we can have ( k ) vertices with degree ( 300 - k ) for ( k ) from 1 to 24.5. Calculating the Sum:   - We need to calculate the sum:     [     sum_{k=1}^{24} k cdot (300 - k)     ]   - This can be expanded as:     [     sum_{k=1}^{24} (300k - k^2)     ]   - Separating the sums, we get:     [     300 sum_{k=1}^{24} k - sum_{k=1}^{24} k^2     ]6. Using Known Summation Formulas:   - The sum of the first ( n ) natural numbers is:     [     sum_{k=1}^{n} k = frac{n(n+1)}{2}     ]   - The sum of the squares of the first ( n ) natural numbers is:     [     sum_{k=1}^{n} k^2 = frac{n(n+1)(2n+1)}{6}     ]   - For ( n = 24 ):     [     sum_{k=1}^{24} k = frac{24 cdot 25}{2} = 300     ]     [     sum_{k=1}^{24} k^2 = frac{24 cdot 25 cdot 49}{6} = 4900     ]7. Substituting Back:   - Substituting these values back into our sum, we get:     [     300 cdot 300 - 4900 = 90000 - 4900 = 85100     ]   - Since each edge is counted twice in the sum of the degrees, the total number of edges is:     [     frac{85100}{2} = 42550     ]8. Construction:   - Label ( k ) vertices with the label ( k ) for ( k ) between 1 and 24.   - Connect all pairs of vertices except those with the same label.   - This construction ensures that no two vertices of the same degree are adjacent, and it achieves the bound.(blacksquare)The final answer is ( boxed{ 42550 } )"},{"problem":"419.

Note that in a regular 20-sided polygon, the vertices taken every other one form a regular 10-sided polygon, and the vertices of this 10-sided polygon, taken every other one, form a regular 5-sided polygon. Therefore, it is sufficient to compare two quantities: 4 a_{20}^{2} and a_{5}^{2}, where a_{20} and a_{5} are the side lengths of the regular 20-sided and 5-sided polygons, respectively. Consider the corresponding fragment and introduce the vertex notations as shown in Fig. 11.3a, b. We can reason in different ways from here.First method. We use the fact that for n>4, the angle of any regular n-sided polygon is obtuse. Consider the triangle A_{1} A_{2} A_{3} with the obtuse angle A_{2} (see Fig. 11.3a). By the corollary of the cosine theorem, 2 a_{20}^{2}frac{8}{3}left(x^{2}+y^{2}right)>4 a_{20}^{2}, from which the answer follows.Third method.

In this direction, the distance between any two vertices measured along the arc is as many units as the difference in their indices (overparen{A_{i} A_{j}}=j-i) (if (j>i)), and in the opposite direction, it is the complement to 15: (15-(j-i)=(15+i)-j), always a positive integer.![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_05_02_ea6a42e4485a5fcfa0ebg-1.jpg?height=599&width=531&top_left_y=405&top_left_x=775)Figure 1Choose the first point of our set to be (A_{1}), and then sequentially those vertices that we find by advancing 2 and 3 units of arc alternately in the direction.

(In Figure 1, the line connecting (A_{1} A_{3} A_{6} A_{8} A_{11} A_{13} A_{1}) is not essential, it only aims to highlight better.)Remarks. 1. Human weakness, to give a hasty, exaggerated answer to questions that can be quickly reviewed. The submitted solutions often lack the statement that from no point is there more than one point in the set 2 or 3 units away. (However, this omission was overlooked in the grading by the editorial board.)2. From vertex (A_{6}), we can return to (A_{1}) more quickly by moving in the opposite direction through (A_{4}) (dashed line in Figure 1). However, this already cannot omit the missing proof, as it cannot be said that any further point is only 2 or 3 units away from the set, since (A_{3} A_{4}=1).3. In the source of the problem given at the time of its release (where 1 and 2 units are used instead of 2 and 3 units), we return to the starting point with only (15:(1+2)=5) \\"mixed pairs\\" of steps, and thus we mark (5 cdot 2) points.

Characterization of the Problem:   We need to find all ordered pairs of positive integers ((m, n)) such that there exists a set (C = {c_1, ldots, c_k}) of colors and an assignment of colors to each of the (mn) unit squares of an (m times n) grid. The assignment must satisfy the condition that for every color (c_i in C) and unit square (S) of color (c_i), exactly two direct (non-diagonal) neighbors of (S) have color (c_i).2. Construction for Even (m) and (n):   We claim that if both (m) and (n) are even, then such a coloring is possible. To construct this, we can use (2 times 2) squares. For example, consider the following (4 times 4) grid:   [   begin{array}{|c|c|c|c|}   hline   c_1 & c_1 & c_2 & c_2    hline   c_1 & c_1 & c_2 & c_2    hline   c_3 & c_3 & c_4 & c_4    hline   c_3 & c_3 & c_4 & c_4    hline   end{array}   ]   Each (2 times 2) block is colored with a single color, and each square in the block has exactly two neighbors of the same color.3. Proof that Only Even (m) and (n) Work:   We need to show that if such a coloring exists, then both (m) and (n) must be even.   - Closed Region Definition:     Define a *closed region* to be the set of all squares with color (c_i) for some (i) and the set of all squares that are enclosed by them.   - Claim 1: The only closed region that encloses no squares is the (2 times 2) square.     - Proof:       Suppose there exists another such region. Let (C_1) be any convex corner of the region and (C_2) and (C_3) the squares that border (C_1). Then for (C_4) the square such that (C_1C_2C_3C_4) is a (2 times 2) square, (C_4) is located within the interior of the closed region. It follows that (C_2) and (C_3) may not border any more squares, from where connectivity implies the region is precisely a (2 times 2) square. (blacksquare)   - Claim 2: Every closed region has even dimensions.     - Proof:       For simplicity, we will call these closed regions *even regions*. Notice that if a region is a union of two even regions, then it must itself be an even region.       Now we proceed by induction on the number of squares in the closed region. For the base case, the smallest possible closed region is a (2 times 2) square, which is indeed an even region. For the inductive step, take any closed region and remove all the squares colored (c_i). These squares form a \\"band\\" around the periphery of the region, so the parity of the width or length measured at any given index will remain the same.       The region that remains is a union of some (at least one) closed regions. By the inductive hypothesis, each of these closed regions is even, so their union is even, and the original closed region is also even, as required. (blacksquare)4. Conclusion:   Since our original (m times n) grid is a union of closed regions, it must have even dimensions too. Therefore, both (m) and (n) must be even.The final answer is ( boxed{ (m, n) } ) such that both (m) and (n) are even."},{"problem":"In triangle triangle ABC, the sides opposite to angles A, B, and C are a, b, and c respectively.

Vasya wrote natural numbers from 1 to 81 in the cells of a 9 times 9 table (each cell contains one number, all numbers are different). It turned out that any two numbers differing by 3 are in adjacent cells. Is it true that there will necessarily be two corner cells, the difference of the numbers in which is divisible by 6?(O. Podlipsky)Answer. True.Solution. Consider the remainders of the numbers in the four corner cells when divided by 3. By the pigeonhole principle, at least two of these numbers, x and y, will have the same remainder, meaning the difference y-x is divisible by 3. Without loss of generality, assume x<y.Color the cells of our table in a checkerboard pattern with black and white such that the corner cells are black. Consider the cells with numbers x, x+3, x+6, ldots, y-3, y. Any two of these numbers are in cells with a common side, meaning they are in cells of different colors. Therefore, all numbers in this sequence that have the same parity as x are in black cells, and all others are in white cells. Since the number y is in a black cell, it has the same parity as x, meaning y-x is even. Thus, y-x is divisible by 6.Comment. Only the answer - 0 points;Considering specific examples of number placement is not evaluated.(1) It is correctly proven that the difference of some two numbers x and y in the corner cells is divisible by 3 - 2 points.(2) The checkerboard coloring is considered, and it is noted that numbers differing by 3 are in cells of different colors - 2 points.(3) It is then noted that all corner cells are of the same color, and it is claimed that the numbers in cells x and y have the same parity - another 2 points.The points for advancements (1)-(3) are cumulative. Note that the proof of the evenness of the difference x-y can be conducted without using the checkerboard coloring - such a proof should be evaluated accordingly.Some remarks regarding these points, as well as some errors that may appear in the solutions, are provided below.(1') After obtaining (1), it is claimed without justification that the numbers x and y have the same parity - no additional points are awarded.(2') The idea of checkerboard coloring is not evaluated separately.(3') Even after obtaining (2) and (3), the claim that x and y have the same parity requires some justification. Specifically, it is necessary to mention that there is a path from x to y where the numbers in adjacent cells differ by 3. (This mention can be implicit, for example, in an inductive argument.) If such a mention is absent, the problem is scored no more than 6 points. In particular, criteria (1)-(3) together give a sum of 6.Some participants may believe that the difference between any two numbers in adjacent cells is 3. This fact is incorrect; any reasoning based on this fact is scored 0 points.Some participants may conclude from the statement that any numbers differing by 3 are in cells of different colors (in the checkerboard coloring) that any two adjacent numbers have different parities. This conclusion is incorrect! If such an error is present in the solution, the problem is scored no more than 5 points. (5 points are awarded only if this argument is applied only to numbers having the same remainder when divided by 3.)![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_05_06_38e6a53fd9055131fdcdg-07.jpg?height=450&width=458&top_left_y=318&top_left_x=825)Fig. 1"},{"problem":"## Task ConditionFind the derivative of the specified order.y=(3 x-7) cdot 3^{-x}, y^{I V}=?","solution":"## Solutiony^{prime}=left((3 x-7) cdot 3^{-x}right)^{prime}=left((3 x-7) cdotleft(e^{ln 3}right)^{-x}right)^{prime}==left((3 x-7) cdot e^{-x cdot ln 3}right)^{prime}=3 e^{-x cdot ln 3}-ln 3 cdot(3 x-7) cdot e^{-x cdot ln 3}y^{prime prime}=left(y^{prime}right)^{prime}=left(3 e^{-x cdot ln 3}-ln 3 cdot(3 x-7) cdot e^{-x cdot ln 3}right)^{prime}==-3 ln 3 cdot e^{-x cdot ln 3}-ln 3 cdot 3 cdot e^{-x cdot ln 3}+ln ^{2} 3 cdot(3 x-7) cdot e^{-x cdot ln 3}==-6 ln 3 cdot e^{-x cdot ln 3}+ln ^{2} 3 cdot(3 x-7) cdot e^{-x cdot ln 3}y^{prime prime prime}=left(y^{prime prime}right)^{prime}=left(-6 ln 3 cdot e^{-x cdot ln 3}+ln ^{2} 3 cdot(3 x-7) cdot e^{-x cdot ln 3}right)^{prime}==6 ln ^{2} 3 cdot e^{-x cdot ln 3}+3 ln ^{2} 3 cdot e^{-x cdot ln 3}-ln ^{3} 3 cdot(3 x-7) cdot e^{-x cdot ln 3}==9 ln ^{2} 3 cdot e^{-x cdot ln 3}-ln ^{3} 3 cdot(3 x-7) cdot e^{-x cdot ln 3}y^{I V}=left(y^{prime prime prime}right)^{prime}=left(9 ln ^{2} 3 cdot e^{-x cdot ln 3}-ln ^{3} 3 cdot(3 x-7) cdot e^{-x cdot ln 3}right)^{prime}==-9 ln ^{3} 3 cdot e^{-x cdot ln 3}-3 ln ^{3} 3 cdot e^{-x cdot ln 3}-ln ^{4} 3 cdot(3 x-7) cdot e^{-x cdot ln 3}==-12 ln ^{3} 3 cdot e^{-x cdot ln 3}-ln ^{4} 3 cdot(3 x-7) cdot e^{-x cdot ln 3}==-12 ln ^{3} 3 cdot 3^{-x}-ln ^{4} 3 cdot(3 x-7) cdot 3^{-x}=(7 ln 3-12-3 ln 3 cdot x) cdot ln ^{3} 3 cdot 3^{-x}## Problem Kuznetsov Differentiation 19-20"},{"problem":"Let's find the fraction with the smallest denominator p / q; p, q are positive integers; for whichfrac{99}{100}<frac{p}{q}<frac{100}{101}","solution":"We will show that if a fraction satisfiesfrac{99}{100}<frac{p}{q}<frac{100}{101}then the denominator of the fraction is at least 100+101, the sum of the denominators.

Understanding the problem: We need to find all pairs of positive integers ((m, n)) such that the least common multiple (LCM) of the first (n) positive integers is equal to (m!).2. Using Bertrand's Postulate (Chebyshev's Theorem): Bertrand's Postulate states that for any integer (n > 1), there is always at least one prime (p) such that (n < p < 2n). This implies that the largest prime (p) not greater than (n) is at least (0.5n).3. Analyzing the LCM and factorial:    - The LCM of the first (n) positive integers, ( text{lcm}(1, 2, ldots, n) ), is the smallest number that is divisible by each of the integers from 1 to (n).   - The factorial (m!) is the product of all positive integers up to (m).4. Prime factorization and valuation:   - For any prime (p), the (p)-adic valuation (v_p(k)) of an integer (k) is the highest power of (p) that divides (k).   - The (p)-adic valuation of (m!) is given by:     [     v_p(m!) = leftlfloor frac{m}{p} rightrfloor + leftlfloor frac{m}{p^2} rightrfloor + leftlfloor frac{m}{p^3} rightrfloor + cdots     ]   - The (p)-adic valuation of (text{lcm}(1, 2, ldots, n)) is:     [     v_p(text{lcm}(1, 2, ldots, n)) = max(v_p(1), v_p(2), ldots, v_p(n))     ]5. Considering the power of 2:   - The (2)-adic valuation of (m!) is at least (frac{m}{2}) because:     [     v_2(m!) = leftlfloor frac{m}{2} rightrfloor + leftlfloor frac{m}{4} rightrfloor + leftlfloor frac{m}{8} rightrfloor + cdots geq frac{m}{2}     ]   - The (2)-adic valuation of (text{lcm}(1, 2, ldots, n)) is (log_2(n)) because the highest power of 2 that divides any number up to (n) is (2^{lfloor log_2(n) rfloor}).6. Inequality analysis:   - We have:     [     v_2(m!) geq frac{m}{2} quad text{and} quad v_2(text{lcm}(1, 2, ldots, n)) = log_2(n)     ]   - Therefore:     [     log_2(n) geq frac{m}{2}     ]   - Since (m geq 0.5n), we get:     [     log_2(n) geq 0.25n     ]7. Solving the inequality:   - The inequality (log_2(n) geq 0.25n) implies that (n) must be relatively small. By solving this inequality, we find that (n leq 16).8.

Characteristic Polynomial:   The characteristic polynomial of ( A ) is given by ( phi_A(k) = det(A - kI) ). However, since we are dealing with ( A + kI ), we need to consider ( det(A + kI) ).3. Rank and Eigenvalues:   The rank of ( A ) is either 0 or 1. This is because ( A ) is a matrix of rank 1 unless all ( a_i = 0 ). If ( (a_1, a_2, ldots, a_n) = (0, 0, ldots, 0) ), then ( A ) is the zero matrix, and its rank is 0. Otherwise, the rank is 1.4. Eigenvalues:   - If ( A ) is the zero matrix, all eigenvalues are 0.   - If ( A ) is not the zero matrix, it has one non-zero eigenvalue and ( n-1 ) zero eigenvalues. This is because ( A ) is a rank-1 matrix, and the non-zero eigenvalue is the trace of ( A ).5.

Shifting to the Left: To shift a graph to the left by h units, we replace every instance of x in the function with (x + h).

Relating the Directrix to the Focus of the Hyperbola: Since the directrix of the parabola passes through one focus of the hyperbola, and assuming the focus of the hyperbola is at (2,0) based on the solution provided, the distance from the vertex of the parabola to its directrix is equal to the x-coordinate of the hyperbola's focus, which is 2.

Is the idea of the Nyírbálók feasible?","solution":"A 687-day \\"Mars-year\\" consists of x 26-day months and y 29-day months, while the Nyírbálók propose to change this to p 27-day months and q 31-day months, then with suitable positive integers x, y, p, q26 x+29 y=687 quad text { and }(1) 27 p+31 q=687, quad text { furthermore }(2)According to the Nyírbálók's intention, p+q<x+y.From (1), 26 x+26 y<687<29 x+29 y, hence23<frac{687}{29}<x+y<frac{687}{26}<27The possible values of x+y are therefore 24, 25, and 26.Similarly, from (2), we get 27 p+27 q<687<31 p+31 q, that is,22<frac{687}{31}<p+q<frac{687}{27}<26Thus, the possible values of p+q are 23, 24, and 25.The grand reform, therefore, seems feasible, but let's consider that x, y, p, and q are all integers.Adding (x+y) to both sides of (1), and (p+q) to both sides of (2),27 x+30 y=687+x+y, (3) 28 p+32 q=687+p+q cdot (4)The left side of (3) is divisible by 3, and the left side of (4) is divisible by 4. Since 687 is divisible by 3 and leaves a remainder of 3 when divided by 4, x+y must be divisible by 3, and p+q must leave a remainder of 1 when divided by 4.Among the possible values, this is only true for x+y=24 and p+q=25, despite the shorter months.The Nyírbálók's attempt, therefore, cannot succeed; the number of months does not decrease but increases after the reform.Note. For completeness, it can be verified that with the choice of x+y=24 and p+q=25, there indeed exists a division of the 687-day year into months of the given lengths. (In the solution, we only used the necessary conditions for such divisions.)If x+y=24, then 3 y=687-26(x+y)=63, so y=21 and x=3, and if p+q=25, then 4 q=687-27(p+q)=12, that is, q=3 and p=22."},{"problem":"For any x in mathbb{R}, the inequality x^{2}+2|x-a| geqslant a^{2} always holds.

Volume of the Prism:   The polygon ( m ) has an area ( S ).

The total volume of these cylindrical regions is the sum of the lengths of the edges times ( pi R^2 ).4. Volume of the Spherical Caps:   At each vertex of the polyhedron, there is a spherical cap of radius ( R ).

Define Variables:   Let ( a = x + y ), ( b = x + z ), and ( c = y + z ). These variables ( a, b, ) and ( c ) must satisfy the triangle inequality, so they can be considered as the sides of a triangle ( triangle ABC ).2.

Verification of the initial claim:   We need to verify that the triples ((m, n, k) = (1, 2, k)) satisfy the inequality (|m^k - n!| le n) for all possible values of (k).   For (m = 1), (n = 2), and any (k):   [   |1^k - 2!| = |1 - 2| = 1 le 2   ]   This confirms that the inequality holds for these values.2. Assumption and contradiction approach:   Consider a triple ((m, n, k)) that satisfies the inequality, such that (n geq 2m). Suppose (|m^k - n!| = n - l) where (l in {1, 2, ldots, n-1}). There are two possible cases:   - Case 1: (m^k - n! = n - l)     [     m^k = n! + (n - l)     ]     This implies:     [     m^k = (n - l) left(frac{n!}{n - l} + 1right)     ]     Since (n geq 2m), (n!) contains at least two multiples of (m). Thus, (m mid frac{n!}{n - l}). Suppose (frac{n!}{n - l} = am).     From the equality:     [     m^k = (n - l) left(am + 1right)     ]     We obtain:     [     am + 1 mid m^k     ]     Take a common prime factor (p) of (am + 1) and (m^k). Then:     [     p mid m Rightarrow p mid am Rightarrow p mid 1     ]     This is a contradiction since (p) cannot divide 1 if (am + 1 > 1).   - Case 2: (m^k - n! = l - n)     [     m^k = n! - (n - l)     ]     This implies:     [     m^k = (n - l) left(frac{n!}{n - l} - 1right)     ]     Similarly, (m mid frac{n!}{n - l}).

They could be skew lines (lines that do not intersect and are not parallel) or they could indeed intersect within plane alpha. Therefore, this statement cannot be universally true.B: If m is contained in alpha, n is contained in alpha, m is parallel to beta, and n is parallel to beta, then alpha is parallel to beta.- According to the theorem of parallel planes, for alpha to be parallel to beta, no line in alpha should intersect beta. However, this proposition lacks the condition that ensures no line in alpha intersects beta. Therefore, merely having two lines in alpha parallel to beta does not guarantee that alpha and beta are parallel.C: If alpha is perpendicular to beta, m is contained in alpha, then m is perpendicular to beta.- The property theorem of perpendicular planes implies that if a plane alpha is perpendicular to another plane beta, and a line m is contained in alpha, then for m to be perpendicular to beta, it specifically needs to be the line of intersection of planes alpha and beta or be parallel to such a line. This proposition incorrectly generalizes the relationship without considering the orientation of m within alpha.D: If alpha is perpendicular to beta, m is perpendicular to beta, m is not contained in alpha, then m is parallel to alpha.- Given that alpha and beta are perpendicular planes, and m is a line perpendicular to beta, if m is not contained within alpha, then it must lie in a direction that does not intersect alpha, making it parallel to alpha.

Claim and Initial Setup:   We claim that the least number of water sources Beto needs is ( lceil frac{n^2}{2} rceil ). To justify this, we consider a chessboard coloring of the ( n times n ) garden, where there are ( lceil frac{n^2}{2} rceil ) black squares and ( lfloor frac{n^2}{2} rfloor ) white squares.2. Height Assignment:   Assign distinct positive real numbers to the black squares in the interval ( (1, 2) ) and distinct positive real numbers to the white squares in the interval ( (0, 1) ). This ensures that no water can flow from a white square to a black square because the height of any black square is always greater than the height of any white square.3. Minimum Water Sources:   Since water cannot flow from a white square to a black square, each black square must have its own water source. Therefore, at least ( lceil frac{n^2}{2} rceil ) water sources are needed in this configuration.4. Sufficiency of ( lceil frac{n^2}{2} rceil ) Water Sources:   To show that ( lceil frac{n^2}{2} rceil ) water sources are sufficient for any configuration, partition the ( n times n ) garden into ( lceil frac{n^2}{2} rceil ) regions of size ( 2 times 1 ) (with possibly one ( 1 times 1 ) region if ( n ) is odd). In each of these regions, place a water source at the platform with the maximum height.5. Water Flow:   In each ( 2 times 1 ) region, the water will flow from the platform with the maximum height to the platform with the minimum height. This ensures that all platforms in the garden will be filled with water.6. Conclusion:   Therefore, the least number of water sources Beto needs to ensure that all platforms are filled with water, regardless of how Ana places the platforms, is ( lceil frac{n^2}{2} rceil ).The final answer is ( boxed{ lceil frac{n^2}{2} rceil } )"},{"problem":"A solid cube has a volume of 1000 mathrm{~cm}^{3}.

Quadratic Form Analysis:   The given quadratic expression is ( mx^2 - 6mx + 5m + 1 ). For this quadratic to be positive for all real ( x ), the discriminant must be negative, and the leading coefficient ( m ) must be positive (since the parabola must open upwards).2. Discriminant Calculation:   The discriminant ( Delta ) of a quadratic equation ( ax^2 + bx + c ) is given by:   [   Delta = b^2 - 4ac   ]   For our quadratic equation ( mx^2 - 6mx + (5m + 1) ), we have:   [   a = m, quad b = -6m, quad c = 5m + 1   ]   Therefore, the discriminant is:   [   Delta = (-6m)^2 - 4(m)(5m + 1) = 36m^2 - 4m(5m + 1)   ]   Simplifying the expression:   [   Delta = 36m^2 - 20m^2 - 4m = 16m^2 - 4m = 4m(4m - 1)   ]3. Discriminant Condition:   For the quadratic to be positive for all ( x ), the discriminant must be negative:   [   4m(4m - 1) < 0   ]   This inequality can be solved by analyzing the sign changes:   [   4m(4m - 1) < 0 implies m(4m - 1) < 0   ]   The critical points are ( m = 0 ) and ( m = frac{1}{4} ). We test the intervals around these points:   - For ( m < 0 ), ( m(4m - 1) ) is positive.   - For ( 0 < m < frac{1}{4} ), ( m(4m - 1) ) is negative.   - For ( m > frac{1}{4} ), ( m(4m - 1) ) is positive.   Therefore, the inequality ( m(4m - 1) < 0 ) holds for:   [   0 < m < frac{1}{4}   ]4. Boundary Conditions:   - At ( m = 0 ), the quadratic becomes ( 1 > 0 ), which is true.   - At ( m = frac{1}{4} ), the quadratic becomes ( left(frac{1}{4}right)x^2 - frac{3}{2}x + frac{5}{4} + 1 = frac{1}{4}(x^2 - 6x + 6) ). The discriminant of ( x^2 - 6x + 6 ) is ( 36 - 24 = 12 ), which is positive, so it has real roots and can be zero.   Therefore, ( m = frac{1}{4} ) does not satisfy the condition of being positive for all ( x ).Conclusion:The set of values of ( m ) for which ( mx^2 - 6mx + 5m + 1 > 0 ) for all real ( x ) is:[0 leq m < frac{1}{4}]The final answer is (boxed{0 leq m < frac{1}{4}})."},{"problem":"6.

We can almost understand without calculation that the described draw is unfair. Imagine that there is 1 ace in the deck. Then the chances for everyone are the same and equal to 0.25. Now imagine that there are 32 aces in the deck. Then with probability 1, the first player immediately gets an ace. Thus, as the number of aces increases, the chances of the first player seem to increase.

Dividing by frac{1}{4} and multiplying by 2 is equivalent to multiplying by 4 and then by 2:[= 2 + left(-frac{1}{8}right) times 4 times 2 + 6 times frac{1}{6}]3. Perform the multiplication and simplify:Multiplying -frac{1}{8} by 4 and then by 2 gives -frac{1}{8} times 4 times 2 = -1. Multiplying 6 times frac{1}{6} simplifies to 1:[= 2 - 1 + 1]4.

Thus, the subset with the largest number of elements that satisfies the required property has at least 50 elements. To conclude that 50 is the largest possible number of elements of a subset that satisfies the required property, it suffices to show that every subset with more than 50 elements contains two multiples. For this, we denote B={1,2,3, ldots, 100} and divide B into 50 disjoint subsets, considering the various subsets of B whose elements are of the form odd number times 2^{k}, with k a natural number. Since there are only 50 odd numbers between 1 and 100, we obtain fifty pairwise disjoint subsets constructed in this way, as follows.- A_{1}={1,2,4,8,16,32,64}=B capleft{1 times 2^{k} midright. for some left.k=0,1,2,3, ldotsright};- A_{2}={3,6,12,24,48,96}=B capleft{3 times 2^{k} midright. for some left.k=0,1,2,3, ldotsright};- A_{3}={5,10,20,40,80}=B capleft{5 times 2^{k} midright. for some left.k=0,1,2,3, ldotsright};- A_{50}={99}=B capleft{99 times 2^{k} midright. for some left.k=0,1,2,3, ldotsright}.Observe that B is the union of these fifty subsets, that is,B={1,2, ldots, 100}=A_{1} cup A_{2} cup ldots cup A_{50}and that if two elements of B are in the same subset A_{i}, then one of them is a multiple of the other. Thus, if a subset A of B has more than 50 elements, we can assert that there are at least two elements of A in the same subset A_{i} and, therefore, one of them is a multiple of the other. This proves that 50 is the maximum number of elements of any subset of B that does not have two elements such that one is a multiple of the other."},{"problem":"a,b,c are positive numbers such that  a^2 + b^2 + c^2 = 2abc + 1 . Find the maximum value of[ (a-2bc)(b-2ca)(c-2ab) ]","solution":"1. Given the equation (a^2 + b^2 + c^2 = 2abc + 1), we need to find the maximum value of ((a-2bc)(b-2ca)(c-2ab)).2. We start by noting that since (a, b, c) are positive numbers, the expression ((a-2bc)(b-2ca)(c-2ab)) must be positive for the maximum value to be positive. Without loss of generality, assume (a ge b ge c).3. First, consider the case where (a le 2bc). In this scenario, we have:   [   c le b le a le 2bc le 2ca le 2ab   ]   This implies:   [   (a - 2bc)(b - 2ca)(c - 2ab) le 0   ]   Therefore, we can assume (a > 2bc).4. Next, we analyze the condition given by the problem:   [   (c - ab)^2 = (a^2 - 1)(b^2 - 1) ge 0   ]   This implies that ((a-1)) and ((b-1)) have the same sign, and so does ((c-1)). We need to consider two cases: (a, b, c > 1) and (a, b, c le 1).5. If (a, b, c > 1), then:   [   a^2 + b^2 + c^2 - 2abc - 1 ge a^2 + 2bc - 2abc - 1 = (a - 1)(a + 1 - 2bc) > 0   ]   This leads to a contradiction. Therefore, we must have (a, b, c le 1).6. Now, consider the expression:   [   (b - 2ca)(c - 2ab) = bc + 4a^2bc - 2a(b^2 + c^2)   ]   Using the given condition (a^2 + b^2 + c^2 = 2abc + 1), we can rewrite it as:   [   bc + 4a^2bc - 2a(2abc + 1 - a^2) = bc + 2a^3 - 2a   ]7. Applying the Arithmetic Mean-Geometric Mean (AM-GM) inequality, we get:   [   frac{1}{2}(a - 2bc) cdot 2(b - 2ca)(c - 2ab) = frac{1}{2}(a - 2bc)(2bc + 4a^3 - 4a)   ]   [   le frac{1}{2} left( frac{a - 2bc + 2bc + 4a^3 - 4a}{2} right)^2 = frac{1}{8}(4a^3 - 3a)^2   ]8. Since (a le 1), it follows that:   [   |4a^3 - 3a| le 1   ]   Therefore:   [   (a - 2bc)(b - 2ca)(c - 2ab) le frac{1}{8}(4a^3 - 3a)^2 le frac{1}{8}   ]9. When (a = 1), (b = c = frac{1}{2}), the expression equals (frac{1}{8}). Thus, the maximum value is (frac{1}{8}).The final answer is (boxed{frac{1}{8}})."},{"problem":"A2.

The sampling interval for the systematic sampling method is  frac{48}{4} = 12 .To find the number of the first student, we use the numbers given: 6, 30, and 42. These numbers are part of our sample, and they already follow the systematic interval of 12 since 30 - 6 = 24 and 42 - 30 = 12. Since 30 and 42 are multiples of 12 and part of the sample, we can deduce that the students in the sample have numbers that are multiples of 12 plus 6 (the smallest number in the sample).Let x be the number we are looking for. According to the systematic sampling method, it must satisfy the condition that x is a multiple of 12 plus 6 and also comes before 6 in the sequence as it's the smallest number we have. The multiplications of 12 we have below 6 are 0 and -12, -24, etc., but we only consider the positive results as valid student numbers. Thus, x = 12 times 0 + 6 = 6 is the number we already have, and the only other possible number is for the case before that, which would be at an interval of 12 before 6. That would be 6 - 12 = -6, but since we don't have negative student numbers, we must start over from the end of the list and count backward by 12 from student number 48. Therefore: 48 - 12 = 36, but since student number 36 is not listed, the next interval would be another 12 backward:36 - 12 = 24, which is also not given, so we try once more:24 - 12 = 12, again not on the list. Finally,12 - 12 = 0 which means we have completed a full cycle and should return to our initial starting point of 6.Given that 6 is part of the sample and no other smaller numbers are possible, the next possible interval backward, which we have not yet considered, would be that the final student's number is 6 + 12 = 18.[boxed{18}]"},{"problem":"A student rolls two dice simultaneously, with the results being a and b.

Simplify each term by expressing them with a common denominator:   [   pleft(frac{1}{x}right) = frac{1}{x^{1999}} + frac{2}{x^{1998}} + frac{3}{x^{1997}} + ldots + 2000   ]4. Multiply through by ( x^{1999} ) to clear the denominators:   [   x^{1999} cdot pleft(frac{1}{x}right) = 1 + 2x + 3x^2 + ldots + 2000x^{1999}   ]5. Therefore, the polynomial whose roots are the reciprocals of the roots of ( p(x) ) is:   [   q(x) = 1 + 2x + 3x^2 + ldots + 2000x^{1999}   ]Conclusion:[boxed{1 + 2x + 3x^2 + ldots + 2000x^{1999}}]"},{"problem":"Given that m > 0, if the coefficient of the x^2 term in the expansion of (1 + mx)^5 is 30 more than the coefficient of the x term, find the value of m.","solution":"Since m > 0 and the coefficient of the x^2 term in the expansion of (1 + mx)^5 is 30 more than the coefficient of the x term, we have:C_{5}^{2} cdot m^2 - C_{5}^{1} cdot m = 30Solving for m, we find that m = -3/2 (rejected, since m must be positive) or m = 2.Therefore, the answer is: boxed{2}.This problem primarily involves the use of the binomial theorem, the general term formula for binomial expansions, and the properties of binomial coefficients.

From the Pythagorean theorem applied to the right triangle K B C, we get|K T| = frac{1}{3} sqrt{b^{2} - frac{b^{2}}{4}} = frac{sqrt{3}}{6} bSince the hexagon K L M N O P consists of six congruent equilateral triangles with side length |K T|, its area isS_{1} = 6 cdot frac{sqrt{3}}{4} left(frac{sqrt{3}}{6} bright)^{2} = frac{3 sqrt{3}}{2} cdot frac{3}{36} b^{2} = frac{sqrt{3}}{8} b^{2}.The area of the triangle A B C is S_{2} = frac{1}{4} sqrt{3} b^{2}. By comparing S_{1} and S_{2}, we find that the area of the hexagon K L M N O P is half of the area of the triangle A B C, so it is equal to 30 mathrm{~cm}^{2}.Evaluation. 1 point for explaining that K T is one-third of K C; 1 point for expressing the area of the triangle A B C; 2 points for expressing the area of the hexagon using the same unknown; 1 point for the ratio of the areas of both figures or an equivalent insight; 1 point for the result.Note. Based on the last solution and given the area of the triangle A B C, students can sequentially calculate b approx 11.8 mathrm{~cm}, |K T| approx 3.4 mathrm{~cm}, and S_{2} approx 30.0 mathrm{~cm}^{2}.

Given that (a, b, c) are distinct positive integers such that (b+c-a), (c+a-b), and (a+b-c) are all perfect squares, we need to find the largest possible value of (a+b+c) that is smaller than 100.2. We start by expressing (a, b, c) in terms of distinct non-negative integers (u, v, w) such that:   [   a = frac{u^2 + v^2}{2}, quad b = frac{u^2 + w^2}{2}, quad c = frac{v^2 + w^2}{2}   ]   Here, (u, v, w) must all be either even or all odd to ensure (a, b, c) are integers.3. We need to ensure that (a, b, c) are distinct and that (a + b + c < 100). This translates to:   [   a + b + c = frac{u^2 + v^2}{2} + frac{u^2 + w^2}{2} + frac{v^2 + w^2}{2} = frac{u^2 + v^2 + w^2}{2} < 100   ]   Therefore:   [   u^2 + v^2 + w^2 < 200   ]4. We now consider two cases: when (u, v, w) are all even and when they are all odd.5. Case 1: (u, v, w) are all even.   - Let (u = 2u_1), (v = 2v_1), (w = 2w_1). Then:     [     u^2 + v^2 + w^2 = 4(u_1^2 + v_1^2 + w_1^2)     ]     [     4(u_1^2 + v_1^2 + w_1^2) < 200 implies u_1^2 + v_1^2 + w_1^2 < 50     ]   - The maximum sum of distinct squares less than 50 is (6^2 + 4^2 + 1^2 = 36 + 16 + 1 = 53), which is not valid.

Case 2: (u, v, w) are all odd.   - Let (u = 2u_1 + 1), (v = 2v_1 + 1), (w = 2w_1 + 1). Then:     [     u^2 + v^2 + w^2 = (2u_1 + 1)^2 + (2v_1 + 1)^2 + (2w_1 + 1)^2     ]     [     = 4u_1^2 + 4u_1 + 1 + 4v_1^2 + 4v_1 + 1 + 4w_1^2 + 4w_1 + 1     ]     [     = 4(u_1^2 + v_1^2 + w_1^2 + u_1 + v_1 + w_1) + 3     ]     [     4(u_1^2 + v_1^2 + w_1^2 + u_1 + v_1 + w_1) + 3 < 200 implies u_1^2 + v_1^2 + w_1^2 + u_1 + v_1 + w_1 < 49.25     ]   - The maximum sum of distinct squares plus their linear terms that fits is (7^2 + 3^2 + 1^2 = 49 + 9 + 1 = 59), which is not valid.

This is because multiplying exponents when the bases are the same is equivalent to adding the exponents, and dividing is equivalent to subtracting the exponents. Given x^{m}=5, we can square both sides to get (x^{m})^{2}=5^{2}. This simplifies to (x^{m})^{2}=25. Next, we know that x^{n}=frac{1}{4}. To divide by x^{n} is the same as multiplying by its reciprocal, so we have 25div x^{n} = 25 times 4 because the reciprocal of frac{1}{4} is 4.Putting it all together, we have:x^{2m-n} = (x^{m})^{2}div x^{n} = 25 div frac{1}{4} = 25 times 4 = 100.Therefore, the correct answer is boxed{D}."},{"problem":"Given the set A={(x_1,x_2,x_3,x_4,x_5) | x_i ∈ {-1, 0, 1}, i=1,2,3,4,5}, determine the number of elements in set A that satisfy the condition \\"1 ≤ |x_1|+|x_2|+|x_3|+|x_4|+|x_5| ≤ 3\\".","solution":"Since x_i ∈ {-1,0,1}, the absolute value |x_i| can only be 0 or 1.

The inequality sqrt[3]{x} + sqrt[3]{2-x} > 0 immediately follows from cubing the equivalent inequality sqrt[3]{x} > sqrt[3]{x-2}.According to the identity already cited,begin{gathered}2 = (sqrt[3]{x})^3 + (sqrt[3]{2-x})^3 = (sqrt[3]{x} + sqrt[3]{2-x})^3 - 3 cdot sqrt[3]{2-x} cdot (sqrt[3]{x} + sqrt[3]{2-x}) = = f^3(x) - 3 cdot sqrt[3]{x(2-x)} cdot f(x)end{gathered}The coefficient of f(x) on the right side of (3), sqrt[3]{x(2-x)}, is less than or equal to 1, since cubing the inequality (x-1)^2 geq 0 gives this, and it is also clear that if x neq 1, then equality cannot hold.We have obtained that if x neq 1, then 2 > f^3(x) - 3f(x), and from this, after rearrangement and factoring,0 > f^3(x) - 3f(x) - 2 = (f(x) - 2)(f(x) + 1)^2The second factor on the right side of the product, (f(x) + 1)^2, is positive because f(x) > 0, so the product itself can only be negative if the first factor, f(x) - 2, is negative, and this is precisely what we wanted to prove."},{"problem":"Let a x^{2}+b x+c be an integer-coefficient polynomial with two distinct roots that are greater than 0 and less than 1.

Therefore, the equation for the tangent line to f(x) at the point (1, f(1)) is y - f(1) = f'(1)(x - 1), which simplifies to y = f'(1)x + f(1) - f'(1). According to the problem, this line coincides with y = x - 1, hence we have:[begin{cases} f'(1)= frac{1}{1+m} = 1  f(1) = ln(1+m) + n = 0 end{cases}]From these equations, we can solve and find that m = 0 and n = 0. For g(x) = ax^2 + bx, we can find the derivative g'(x) = 2ax + b.

Thus, varphi(x) is increasing on (-1, 0] and decreasing on [0, +infty). Since varphi(x) is not monotonic in the interval (t, t + frac{1}{2}), we must have -1  0. This implies -frac{1}{2}  1). Let lambda(x) = frac{xln x + 3x - 2}{x - 1} (x > 1). Then, lambda'(x) = frac{x - ln x - 2}{(x - 1)^2}. Define mu(x) = x - ln x - 2 (x > 1), and since mu'(x) = 1 - frac{1}{x} > 0 (because x > 1) and mu(1) = -1, there exists a unique x_0 > 1 such that mu(x_0) = 0, i.e., x_0 - ln x_0 - 2 = 0. This unique x_0 satisfies that for x in (1, x_0], mu'(x) leq 0, and for x in (x_0, +infty), mu'(x) > 0. Hence, lambda(x) is decreasing on (1, x_0] and increasing on (x_0, +infty).

Each coin has the number 0 on one side and the number 1 on the other side. All coins are fair, meaning the probability of landing on 0 is equal to the probability of landing on 1. We randomly select 6 coins from the bag and toss them. What is the probability that the sum of the numbers that land on the red coins is equal to the sum of the numbers that land on the green coins?","solution":"B2. If the coins are fair, the probability can be calculated using the formulaP=frac{text { favorable outcomes }}{text { all outcomes }}First, let's count all the outcomes. We get them by first choosing 6 coins from the urn in binom{10}{6} ways and then flipping each coin in 2 ways. Therefore, the total number of outcomes is binom{10}{6} cdot 2^{6}=13440.To count the favorable outcomes, we consider the cases of how many red coins are drawn and how many of these coins land on 1.If we draw 5 red coins, this can be done in binom{5}{5}=1 way, and the remaining 1 green coin can be chosen in binom{5}{1}=5 ways. Since there is only one green coin, the number 1 can land on the red coins either 0 times or 1 time. The first possibility can occur in binom{5}{0}=1 way, and the second in binom{5}{1}=5 ways. In both cases, the green coin is uniquely determined. This gives us a total of1 cdot 5 cdot(1+5)=30outcomes.If we draw 4 red coins, this can be done in binom{5}{4}=5 ways, and the remaining 2 green coins can be chosen in binom{5}{2}=10 ways. Then, the number 1 can land on the red coins 0 times, 1 time, or 2 times. The first possibility can occur in binom{4}{0}=1 way, as the green coins are then uniquely determined. The second possibility can occur in binom{4}{1} cdotbinom{2}{1}=8 ways, as the number 1 must land on one of the four red coins and one of the two green coins. The last possibility can occur in binom{4}{2}=6 ways, as the green coins are then uniquely determined. This gives us a total of5 cdot 10 cdot(1+8+6)=750outcomes.If we draw 3 red coins, this can be done in binom{5}{3}=10 ways, and the remaining 3 green coins can be chosen in binom{5}{3}=10 ways. The number 1 can land on the 3 red coins 0 times, 1 time, 2 times, or 3 times, and the same number of times on the 3 green coins. The first possibility can occur in binom{3}{0}^{2}=1 way, the second in binom{3}{1}^{2}=9 ways, the third in binom{3}{2}^{2}=9 ways, and the last in binom{3}{3}^{2}=1 way. Therefore, we have a total of10 cdot 10 cdot(1+9+9+1)=2000outcomes.Due to the symmetry between red and green coins, the number of favorable outcomes when drawing 2 or 1 red coin is the same as when drawing 2 or 1 green coin, which is the same as drawing 4 or 5 red coins. Therefore, the total number of favorable outcomes is30+750+2000+750+30=3560The probability that the sum of the numbers that land on the red coins is equal to the sum of the numbers that land on the green coins is thereforeP=frac{3560}{13440}=frac{89}{336} .![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_06_07_e347356273e0c1397da7g-30.jpg?height=75&width=1751&top_left_y=1136&top_left_x=164)![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_06_07_e347356273e0c1397da7g-30.jpg?height=66&width=1731&top_left_y=1192&top_left_x=174)Listing all possible color combinations of the drawn coins ...................................... 1 point.![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_06_07_e347356273e0c1397da7g-30.jpg?height=54&width=1727&top_left_y=1304&top_left_x=176)Correct final result .............................................................................................. 1 point."},{"problem":"10.

Solution It is sufficient to find solutions (A, B, C) without any common factor k which divides A, B and C, for then the complete set of solutions is (kA, kB, kC) with k = 2 m 3 n . Put D = B - A, then C = A + 2D, which has the same parity as A, so A and B must have opposite parity. Suppose A is odd. Then C is odd and greater than 1, hence a power of 3. If A > 1, then A is also a power of 3, and hence B = (A + C)/2 is also. Contradiction. So A must be 1. Suppose C = 3 n . Then B = (A + C)/2 = (1 + (4 - 1) n )/2 = (1 + (-1) n + (-1) n-1 4n + terms in 4 2 and higher)/2. Hence n is odd and B = 2 mod 4. But B is a power of 2, so B = 2 and C = 3. Suppose A is even, then B is odd and hence a power of 3. If A is divisible by 3, then so is C. Contradiction. So A must be a power of 2. Similarly, C must be a power of 2. If A is divisible by 4, then since C is a larger power of 2, it must also be divisible by 4. Hence 2D = C - A is divisible by 4, so B is divisible by 2. Contradiction. So A must be 2. It is easy to check that (A, B, C) = (2, 3, 4) and (2, 9, 16) are solutions. It remains to show that there are no solutions with B divisible by 27. Thanks to John Pye for the next part Suppose there is such a solution, then we have A = 2, C a power of 2, B = 3 n = 2 m - 1 ( (A+C)/2). B = 27 does not work, so B ≥ 81 and hence m ≥ 4. We have 3 4 = 1 mod 16, so it is easy to check that 3 4k - 1 = 0 mod 16, 3 4k+1 - 1 = 2 mod 16, 3 4k+2 - 1 = 8 mod 16, 3 4k+3 - 1 = 10 mod 16. So n must be a multiple of 4. But since 3 4 = 1 mod 5, that means 3 n - 1 = 0 mod 5, so B cannot be a power of 2.

Thus, the sum of their ages is 11 such parts. On the other hand, if the average age is 11 years, then the sum of the ages is 33 years. From this, it follows that one part is three years.

The right side of this equation must yield a natural number that is divisible by 5, i.e., a number that ends in the digit 0 or 5.The number 69 - 6b cannot end in 0, because the number 6b can only end in one of the numbers 6, 2, 8, 4, or 0.Therefore, the number 69 - 6b must end in the digit 5, i.e., 6b must end in 4.

Find the degree measure of the smallest [angle](https://artofproblemsolving.com/wiki/index.php/Angle).","solution":"Solution 1The average angle in an 18-gon is 160^circ. In an arithmetic sequence the average is the same as the median, so the middle two terms of the sequence average to 160^circ. Thus for some positive (the sequence is increasing and thus non-constant) integer d, the middle two terms are (160-d)^circ and (160+d)^circ. Since the step is 2d the last term of the sequence is (160 + 17d)^circ, which must be less than 180^circ, since the polygon is convex. This gives 17d < 20, so the only suitable positive integer d is 1. The first term is then (160-17)^circ = fbox{143}.Solution 2Another way to solve this problem would be to use exterior angles. [Exterior angles](https://artofproblemsolving.com/wiki/index.php/Exterior_angle) of any polygon add up to 360^{circ}. Since there are 18 exterior angles in an 18-gon, the average measure of an exterior angles is frac{360}{18}=20^circ. We know from the problem that since the exterior angles must be in an arithmetic sequence, the median and average of them is 20. Since there are even number of exterior angles, the middle two must be 19^circ and 21^circ, and the difference between terms must be 2. Check to make sure the smallest exterior angle is greater than 0: 19-2(8)=19-16=3^circ. It is, so the greatest exterior angle is 21+2(8)=21+16=37^circ and the smallest interior angle is 180-37=boxed{143}.Solution 3The sum of the angles in a 18-gon is (18-2) cdot 180^circ = 2880 ^circ. Because the angles are in an arithmetic sequence, we can also write the sum of the angles as a+(a+d)+(a+2d)+dots+(a+17d)=18a+153d, where a is the smallest angle and d is the common difference. Since these two are equal, we know that 18a+153d = 2880 ^circ, or 2a+17d = 320^circ. The smallest value of d that satisfies this is d=2, so a=143. Other values of d and a satisfy that equation, but if we tried any of them the last angle would be greater than 180, so the only value of a that works is a=boxed{143}.Note: The equation 2a+17d = 320^circ can also be obtained by using the sum of an arithmetic sequence formula frac{2a_1+(n-1)d}{2} cdot n.

The set  P consists of  m lines in the plane such that every line in  P is an axis of symmetry for  S.

We need to prove that ( m leq n ) and determine when equality holds.1. Convex Hull and Symmetry Lines:   Let ( C ) be the convex hull of the ( n ) points. Assume that ( C ) is a ( c )-gon (a polygon with ( c ) vertices).2. Case 1: Lines Not Containing Vertices of ( C ):   - If one of the lines in ( P ) contains none of the vertices of ( C ), then ( c = 2x ) is even (since the line must divide the vertices of ( C ) into two equal sets).   - Each line that goes through a vertex ( A ) must also go through another vertex ( B ), with exactly ( x-1 ) vertices of ( C ) between ( A ) and ( B ) along the boundary of ( C ). Thus, there is at most one line through ( A ) and this line is the same as the one through ( B ). Therefore, there are at most ( x ) lines through the vertices of ( C ).   - Each line ( Delta ) that does not contain a vertex of ( C ) must go through the interior of two opposite sides of ( C ), say ([AB]) and ([MP]), and ( Delta ) is their common perpendicular bisector. Thus, there are at most ( x ) such lines. Additionally, the other vertices of ( C ) can be paired such that ( Delta ) is the perpendicular bisector of each pair.   Therefore, there are at most ( 2x leq n ) lines in ( P ).   If equality occurs, then ( S = C ) (since ( 2x = n )), and the ( n ) points must be the vertices of a regular ( n )-gon. In this case, ( P ) is the set of all axes of symmetry of ( S ).3. Case 2: Lines Containing Vertices of ( C ):   - If each of the ( m ) lines contains at least one vertex of ( C ), then each line divides the ( n ) points into two sets with the same number of points. Thus, each vertex of ( C ) belongs to at most one of the lines. Therefore, there are at most ( c leq n ) lines in ( P ).   If equality occurs, then ( S = C ) and each line contains exactly one of the points (otherwise, two points would define the same axis, and there would be fewer than ( n ) lines). Thus, ( n ) is odd. For each pair of vertices ( A ) and ( B ), there is exactly one vertex ( M ) such that the arcs ( AM ) and ( BM ) along the boundary of ( C ) contain the same number of vertices. Using the axis of symmetry through ( M ), this line is the perpendicular bisector of ([AB]), implying that the ( n ) points are the vertices of a regular ( n )-gon.Thus, in each case, we have ( m leq n ) and equality occurs if and only if the ( n ) points are the vertices of a regular ( n )-gon, and ( P ) is the set of all axes of symmetry of ( S ).(blacksquare)The final answer is ( boxed{ m leq n } ) and equality holds if and only if the ( n ) points are the vertices of a regular ( n )-gon, and ( P ) is the set of all axes of symmetry of ( S )."},{"problem":"Let the complex number (z = a^2 - a - 2 + (a^2 - 3a - 4)i), where (i) is the imaginary unit, and (a in mathbb{R}).((1)) If the complex number (z) is a pure imaginary number, find the value of (a).((2)) If the point corresponding to the complex number (z) in the complex plane lies in the second or fourth quadrant, find the range of values for the real number (a).","solution":"Solution:((1)) If the complex number (z = (a^2 - a - 2) + (a^2 - 3a - 4)i) (where (a in mathbb{R})) is a pure imaginary number,  then (a^2 - a - 2 = 0) and (a^2 - 3a - 4 neq 0),  Solving this, we get: (a = 2);  ((2)) If the point corresponding to the complex number (z) in the complex plane lies in the second or fourth quadrant,  then ((a^2 - a - 2)(a^2 - 3a - 4) < 0), which simplifies to ((a - 2)(a + 1)^2(a - 4) < 0),  Solving this, we find (2 < a < 4).Therefore, the answers are:((1)) (boxed{a = 2})((2)) (boxed{2 < a < 4})"},{"problem":"Given the function f(x)=ax-alnx-frac{{e}^x}{x}.

With l(x) = e^{2x} - x + 1, we find that the derivative l'(x) = 2e^{2x} - 1 is always greater than 2e^2 - 1, making l(x) strictly increasing. This ensures that for any k, the line h(x) = kx will intersect l(x) at most once.Combining all three conditions, we get that the range of the real number k must satisfy both k geq -1 and k leq 3. Therefore, the value of k lies within the range boxed{[-1, 3]}."},{"problem":"In the geometric sequence {a_{n}}, a_{5}=6.

Then A_{i-1} is visible to A_{j}, A_{j} is visible to A_{k}, and A_{k} is visible to A_{i+1}.Proof of Lemma 1: Consider the triangulation of the polygon that includes the edges A_{i} A_{j} and A_{i} A_{k}.Lemma 2: Using the notation from Lemma 1, A_{j} A_{k} is an edge.Proof of Lemma 2: Assume A_{j} A_{k} is a diagonal inside the polygon.By Lemma 1, A_{j} can see A_{j-1}. But A_{j} A_{i} and A_{j} A_{k} are internal diagonals, so A_{j} A_{i-1} is an edge.Thus, on the boundary of the polygon, there is only one vertex between A_{i} and A_{j}.Similarly, there is only one vertex between A_{j} and A_{k}, and between A_{k} and A_{i} on the boundary of the polygon. This contradicts n>6.Therefore, A_{j} A_{k} is an edge, and k=j-1.Lemmas 1 and 2 are proved.Let i be such that A_{i-1} and A_{i+1} are mutually visible (such an i exists, for example, take the outermost triangle in the triangulation of the polygon).By Lemma 2, A_{i-1} can see A_{i+2}, A_{i+1} can see A_{i-2}, and A_{i-2} can see A_{i+2}. Thus, we have found four vertices such that both A_{i-1} and A_{i+1} can see these four vertices.If A_{i} can see some vertex, then A_{i-1} and A_{i+1} must also see it (by Lemma 1). Therefore, A_{i} can see A_{i-2} and A_{i+2}, which implies that A_{i-2} A_{i+2} is an edge (by Lemma 2). Any convex polygon can serve as an example.The remaining case is n=6. In this case, by Lemma 2, there exist vertices A_{i}, A_{j}, A_{k} such that A_{i} A_{j}, A_{j} A_{k}, and A_{k} A_{i} are internal diagonals of the polygon.Without loss of generality, assume they are A_{2}, A_{4}, A_{6} in the hexagon.

First, we find the derivative of fleft(xright) with respect to x to get the slope of the tangent line at any point on the curve:f'left(xright) = frac{d}{dx}[x(m-e^{-2x})] = m-left(1-2xright)e^{-2x}2.

Let's define gleft(xright) = left(1-2xright)e^{-2x}.

Therefore, we proceed with g(x) = (1-2x)e^{-2x}.4. Analyzing the behavior of g(x):   - When x > 1, g'(x) > 0 indicating g(x) is monotonically increasing on (1, +infty).   - When x < 1, g'(x) < 0 indicating g(x) is monotonically decreasing on (-infty, 1).5.

The results showed that the average yield of both rice varieties A and B was 1200 kg/acre, with variances of S_{A}^{2}=186.9 and S_{B}^{2}=325.3, respectively.

Most of the theorems you will study in high school are older, including those used to study the variations of a function, such as Rolle's theorem. For before Euler, one knew how to study how a \\"quantity\\" varied in relation to another quantity.Euler's original idea was to introduce a mathematical object \\"function\\" that associates a value with a variable. This is a very general notion: the variable and the associated value are not necessarily numbers. And the functions thus defined do not have properties a priori; it is the hypothesis that allows defining properties in relation to the problem posed. Most of the functions you will handle are \\"good functions,\\" such as polynomial functions or the exponential function, for example. But when you need to solve a very general problem about functions, for example, a functional equation (about 10 % of Olympiad problems are functional equations), even if, in the end, the solution is a very elementary function, you cannot use, in the proof, the assumption that you are looking for a \\"good function.\\""},{"problem":"Let f(x) = x(x-1)(x-2), then f'(0) = ______.","solution":"To solve, simplify the function f(x) = x(x-1)(x-2) to get f(x) = x^3 - 3x^2 + 2x.

This question examines the properties of isosceles triangles and the relationship between the sides of a triangle; for problems where the equal sides and base are not explicitly known, it is essential to consider both possibilities, discuss them separately, and verify whether each scenario can form a triangle.

Given Conditions and Definitions:   - The arithmetic mean of two different positive integers ( x ) and ( y ) is a two-digit integer.   - Interchanging the digits of this two-digit integer gives the geometric mean of ( x ) and ( y ).2. Formulating the Problem:   - Let the arithmetic mean be (overline{ab}), where (a) and (b) are digits.   - Therefore, (frac{x + y}{2} = 10a + b).   - The geometric mean is (overline{ba}), so (sqrt{xy} = 10b + a).3. Deriving the Relationship:   - From the arithmetic mean, we have:     [     x + y = 2(10a + b)     ]   - From the geometric mean, we have:     [     xy = (10b + a)^2     ]4. Solving for (x) and (y):   - We need to solve the system of equations:     [     x + y = 20a + 2b     ]     [     xy = (10b + a)^2     ]   - Assume (x neq y), hence (frac{x + y}{2} > sqrt{xy}), implying (10a + b > 10b + a), which simplifies to (a > b).5. Expressing (x) and (y) in Terms of (a) and (b):   - Let (x) and (y) be the roots of the quadratic equation:     [     t^2 - (20a + 2b)t + (10b + a)^2 = 0     ]   - The roots are given by:     [     t = frac{(20a + 2b) pm sqrt{(20a + 2b)^2 - 4(10b + a)^2}}{2}     ]   - Simplifying the discriminant:     [     (20a + 2b)^2 - 4(10b + a)^2 = 400a^2 + 80ab + 4b^2 - 400b^2 - 80ab - 4a^2 = 396a^2 - 396b^2 = 396(a^2 - b^2)     ]   - Therefore, the roots are:     [     t = 10a + b pm sqrt{99(a^2 - b^2)}     ]6. Ensuring Integer Solutions:   - For (t) to be an integer, (sqrt{99(a^2 - b^2)}) must be an integer.   - This implies (99(a^2 - b^2)) must be a perfect square.   - Since (99 = 3^2 times 11), (a^2 - b^2) must be divisible by 11.7. Possible Values for (a) and (b):   - Given (a, b in {1, 2, ldots, 9}), we need (11 mid (a + b)(a - b)).   - Possible pairs ((a, b)) are:     [     (6, 5), (7, 4), (8, 3), (9, 2)     ]8. Checking Each Pair:   - For ((a, b) = (6, 5)):     [     x + y = 20 cdot 6 + 2 cdot 5 = 130     ]     [     xy = (10 cdot 5 + 6)^2 = 56^2 = 3136     ]     - Solving (t^2 - 130t + 3136 = 0) gives (x = 98) and (y = 32).9. Uniqueness in Base 10:   - The solution ((x, y) = (98, 32)) is unique up to permutation in base 10.10. No Solution in Base 12:    - In base 12, (g = 12):      [      g^2 - 1 = 143 = 11 times 13      ]    - Since (11 times 13 > 24), there is no solution in base 12.11. Other Bases:    - For (g = 9), (g^2 - 1 = 80), which is less than (18), so a solution exists.    - For (g = 14), (g^2 - 1 = 195), which is greater than (28), so no solution exists.The final answer is ( boxed{ (x, y) = (98, 32) } ) or ( (32, 98) )."},{"problem":"In the geometric sequence {a_n}, a_3=2, a_5=8, find a_7 = ______.","solution":"Given that {a_n} is a geometric sequence, we have the property that the square of any term is equal to the product of its two neighboring terms.

What is the maximum numbers of words one can pick such that any two picked words have at least one position where they both have consonants, but different consonants?","solution":"1. Problem Restatement and Setup:   We are given a language with three letters: (A), (B), and (C). A word in this language is defined as a sequence of exactly 100 letters, with exactly 40 consonants (either (B) or (C)) and 60 vowels ((A)). We need to determine the maximum number of such words that can be picked such that any two picked words have at least one position where they both have consonants, but different consonants.2. Construction of Words:   Consider the 40 positions that will be occupied by consonants. Each of these positions can be either (B) or (C). Therefore, there are (2^{40}) possible sequences of consonants. For each of these sequences, we can append 60 (A)'s to form a word of 100 letters. This gives us (2^{40}) distinct words.3. Verification of the Condition:   We need to verify that any two distinct words from this set have at least one position where they both have consonants, but different consonants. Consider two distinct sequences of consonants. Since they are distinct, there is at least one position where they differ. At this position, one word has (B) and the other has (C), satisfying the condition.4. Inductive Argument:   To generalize, we can use induction on the number of (A)'s. For (k = 0), the problem is trivial as there are no (A)'s, and the maximum number of words is (2^{40}). Assume the result holds for (k) (A)'s. Now consider (k+1) (A)'s. Partition the words into sets based on the last letter being (A), (B), or (C). For the sets ending in (B) or (C), change the last letter to (A) and consider the resulting sets. By the inductive hypothesis, each of these sets has at most (2^{40}) words. Summing these and dividing by 2, we get the desired bound.5. Conclusion:   By the construction and verification, we have shown that the maximum number of words is (2^{40}).The final answer is (boxed{2^{40}})."},{"problem":"In triangle ABC, let M be the midpoint of BC, H be the orthocenter, and O be the circumcenter.

It is known that ( H' ) lies on the circumcircle of ( triangle ABC ).4. Distance Calculation:   - Since ( N ) is the reflection of ( M ) over ( H ), ( N ) and ( H' ) are the same point. Therefore, ( N ) lies on the circumcircle of ( triangle ABC ).5. Distance from Circumcenter:   - Given ( OA = ON = 11 ), and since ( N ) lies on the circumcircle, ( ON = R ), where ( R ) is the circumradius of ( triangle ABC ).6.

Recall that if x is a real number, then lfloor x rfloor (the [i]floor[/i] of x) is the greatest integer that is less than or equal to x.","solution":"1. Estimate the sum using an integral approximation:   We start by approximating the sum ( S_n = sum_{k=1}^n frac{1}{sqrt{2k-1}} ) using an integral. The idea is to approximate the sum by the integral of a similar function. Specifically, we use:   [   sum_{k=1}^n frac{1}{sqrt{2k-1}} approx int_1^n frac{dx}{sqrt{2x-1}}   ]2. Simplify the integral:   To simplify the integral, we make a substitution. Let ( u = 2x-1 ), then ( du = 2dx ) or ( dx = frac{du}{2} ). The limits of integration change accordingly: when ( x = 1 ), ( u = 1 ); and when ( x = n ), ( u = 2n-1 ). Thus, the integral becomes:   [   int_1^n frac{dx}{sqrt{2x-1}} = int_1^{2n-1} frac{du}{2sqrt{u}} = frac{1}{2} int_1^{2n-1} u^{-frac{1}{2}} , du   ]3. Evaluate the integral:   The integral ( int u^{-frac{1}{2}} , du ) is straightforward:   [   int u^{-frac{1}{2}} , du = 2u^{frac{1}{2}} = 2sqrt{u}   ]   Applying the limits of integration, we get:   [   frac{1}{2} left[ 2sqrt{u} right]_1^{2n-1} = left[ sqrt{u} right]_1^{2n-1} = sqrt{2n-1} - sqrt{1} = sqrt{2n-1} - 1   ]4. Refine the approximation:   The initial approximation can be refined by considering the excess on the interval ([0,1]). A better estimate is:   [   S_n approx 1 + int_1^n frac{dx}{sqrt{2x-1}}   ]   Using the previous result, we have:   [   S_n approx 1 + (sqrt{2n-1} - 1) = sqrt{2n-1}   ]5. Apply the approximation to ( S_{4901} ):   For ( n = 4901 ):   [   S_{4901} approx sqrt{2 cdot 4901 - 1} = sqrt{9801} = 99   ]6. Estimate the error:   To rigorize the approximation, we estimate the error. The error in the interval ([m, m+1]) for ( m = 1, 2, ldots, n-1 ) is:   [   int_m^{m+1} frac{dx}{sqrt{2x-1}} - frac{1}{sqrt{2m-1}}   ]   Using the integral approximation, the error is:   [   frac{sqrt{2}}{sqrt{m+1} + sqrt{m}} - frac{1}{sqrt{2m-1}}   ]   Simplifying, we get:   [   frac{sqrt{4m+2} - sqrt{m+1} - sqrt{m}}{sqrt{2m-1}(sqrt{m+1} + sqrt{m})} < frac{sqrt{6} - sqrt{2} - 1}{2sqrt{2}m}   ]7. Sum the errors:   The total error is at most:   [   sum_{m=1}^{n-1} frac{sqrt{6} - sqrt{2} - 1}{2sqrt{2}m} = left( frac{sqrt{3}}{2} - frac{1}{2} - frac{sqrt{2}}{4} right) H_{n-1}   ]   where ( H_{n-1} ) is the ((n-1))-th harmonic number. Using the approximation ( H_{n-1} approx log(n-1) + gamma ) (where (gamma) is the Euler-Mascheroni constant), we get:   [   left( frac{sqrt{3}}{2} - frac{1}{2} - frac{sqrt{2}}{4} right) (log(n-1) + 1) < 0.13   ]8. Final bounds:   Thus, the value of the sum is between:   [   sqrt{9802} - sqrt{2} + 1 - 0.13 > 98 quad text{and} quad sqrt{9802} - sqrt{2} + 1 < 99   ]   Therefore, the floor of the sum is:   [   lfloor S_{4901} rfloor = 98   ]The final answer is (boxed{98})"},{"problem":"10.

Clearly, the number 2 pi is the period of each of the functions F_{mathrm{m}}.Lemma. Let f be a differentiable function with period 2 pi. Then the number of zeros of the function f on the half-interval [0 ; 2 pi) does not exceed the number of zeros of its derivative on the same half-interval.Proof. We use Rolle's theorem: between two zeros of a differentiable function, there is at least one zero of its derivative (see the comment to the problem). Let x_{1}, x_{2}, ldots, x_{mathrm{N}} be the zeros of the function on the specified half-interval. By Rolle's theorem, on each of the intervals left(x_{1} ; x_{2}right), left(x_{2} ; x_{3}right), ldots, left(x_{mathrm{N}-1} ; x_{mathrm{N}}right), left(x_{mathrm{N}} ; x_{1} + 2 piright), there is at least one zero of the derivative. However, the zero of the derivative on the last interval (denote it by y) may lie outside the half-interval [0 ; 2 pi). In this case, consider y - 2 pi—this is also a zero of the derivative, since the derivative of a periodic function is periodic. The lemma is proved.From the lemma, it follows that N(F_{mathrm{m}}) geq N(F_{mathrm{m}} + 1). Therefore, it is sufficient to prove that N(F_{mathrm{M}}) geq 2 k_{0} for a sufficiently large number M.Since frac{k_{0}}{k_{1}} 1 - epsilon > 0 for even n and F_{mathrm{M}}left(frac{pi n}{k_{0}}right) < -1 + epsilon < 0 for odd n. Therefore, the continuous function F_{mathrm{M}} must have a zero between any two adjacent points x_{mathrm{n}} = frac{pi n}{k_{0}}, where n = 0, 1, ldots, 2 k_{0}. Hence, N(F_{mathrm{M}}) geq 2 k_{0}.Comments. 1^{circ}. A periodic function can be thought of as a function on a circle. Then the statement of the lemma can be reformulated as follows: the number of zeros of a function on a circle does not exceed the number of zeros of its derivative, and the proof becomes more transparent.2^{circ}. The idea of the proof of Rolle's theorem: consider the extrema (maximum and minimum) of the function on the interval connecting the points where the function is zero. If one of the extrema is achieved inside the interval, then the derivative is zero at that point. If both extrema are achieved at the endpoints of the interval, then the function is identically zero on that interval.3^{0}. In general, a function may have infinitely many zeros on the half-interval. In this case, the lemma should be understood as follows: if f has infinitely many zeros on the half-interval, then f^{prime} also has infinitely many zeros on this half-interval. Verify that the proof remains valid in this case.Send a comment"},{"problem":"If 4 x+12=48, the value of x is(A) 12(B) 32(C) 15(D) 6(E) 9","solution":"If 4 x+12=48, then 4 x=48-12 or 4 x=36, and so x=frac{36}{4}=9.ANsWER: (E)"},{"problem":"The complex number z= frac {2+mi}{1+i} (where min mathbb{R}) is a real number, then m=　　.A: -2B: -1C: 1D: 2","solution":"Since z= frac {2+mi}{1+i}= frac {(2+mi)(1-i)}{(1+i)(1-i)}= frac {(2+m)+(m-2)i}{2} is a real number,it follows that m-2=0.

Thus, the remainders when these numbers are divided by 3 follow the pattern ldots 0 ; 2 ; 1 ; 0 ; 2 ; 1 ; 0 ldotsAmong the given numbers, there are 53 numbers that give a remainder of 1 when divided by 3 (they form the set A={10 ; 25 ; 40 ; ldots ; 790}), 53 numbers that are divisible by 3 (B={15 ; 30 ; 45 ; ldots ; 795}), and 54 numbers that give a remainder of 2 when divided by 3 (C={5 ; 20 ; 35 ; ldots ; 800}).The sum of three numbers can be divisible by 3 in the following cases.1) All three numbers give the same remainder when divided by 3. There are C_{54}^{3} ways to choose 3 numbers from set C and C_{53}^{3} ways to choose 3 numbers from sets A and B. In total, we get frac{54 cdot 53 cdot 52}{6}+2 cdot frac{53 cdot 52 cdot 51}{6}=24804+2 cdot 23426=71656 ways.2) If not all remainders are the same, the only suitable case is when all three remainders are different, i.e., we must choose one number from each of the sets A, B, C.

Finally, this means that the radius of Gamma is dfrac{360+frac{40}{9}}{2}=180+dfrac{20}{9}.Since the area is maximized when the altitude to AB is maximized, clearly we want the last vertex to be the highest point of Gamma, which just makes the altitude have length 180+dfrac{20}{9}.

Since ( B ) is the midpoint of ( CC' ), we have ( BC = BC' ).2.

Circle Centered at ( B ):   - Since ( C' ) is the reflection of ( C ) across ( B ), ( B ) is equidistant from ( C ) and ( C' ). Therefore, ( B ) is the center of the circle passing through ( A, P, C, ) and ( C' ).4. Isosceles Triangle ( triangle BAP ):   - Since ( B ) is the center of the circle, ( BA = BP = BC ). This implies that ( triangle BAP ) is isosceles with ( BA = BP ).5. Calculating ( angle PBA ):   - In the cyclic quadrilateral ( APCC' ), the opposite angles sum up to ( 180^circ ). Therefore, ( angle APC + angle ACC' = 180^circ ).   - Since ( angle DCP = angle CAP = 25^circ ), we have ( angle APC = 180^circ - 2 times 25^circ = 130^circ ).   - In ( triangle BAP ), since ( BA = BP ), the base angles are equal. Let ( angle PBA = x ). Then, ( angle BAP = x ).   - The sum of angles in ( triangle BAP ) is ( 180^circ ), so ( x + x + 130^circ = 180^circ ).   - Solving for ( x ), we get:     [     2x + 130^circ = 180^circ     ]     [     2x = 50^circ     ]     [     x = 25^circ     ]6.
