At 43, I think you need to take the help of an IVF specialist. However, as you conceived a year and a half back, you have good chances of conceiving again. Please remember, that as maternal age advances, chances of chromosomal disorders ( like Edwards ) increases. Have evaluation of your ovarian reserve, your partner's semen analysis, genetic counselling and then proceed ahead with the treatment advised by an IVF practitioner.

As ejaculation occurred around the vagina, some seminal fluid might have technically entered the vaginal canal, but this is a very remote possibility.

You have been trying to conceive for 3 years now. Firstly, consult a reputed Infertility practitioner. Evaluate cause of your high testosterone ( mostly it should be PCOS ) - have complete hormonal profile done including Day 2 FSH and LH, SHBG , DHEAS, Fasting insulin, Glucose tolerance test, Prolactin, Thyroid hormone profile, AMH ( to check ovarian reserve - because even the ovary might be damaged in ectopic pregnancy ). With just one patent tube, your chances of natural conception are less than normal. Have your husband's semen analysis done. You might require a diagnostic laparoscopy or an HSG to evaluate current status of your fallopian tubes. Ovulation studies should be done and documented. I think you should take recourse to IUI ( intra uterine insemination ) if natural conception has not yet occurred, but that is after your tubal patency testing.

Also, chances of infection and tubal blockage consequent to the previous abortion have to be ruled out.

I have a normal 28 day cycle and ovulate each month. The odds of me getting pregnant now are thin (I m 41) but i am trying still. My friend suggested turkey baster. do you think that is a viable solution and how do i do it. I can not afford going to a fertility clinic.","Doctor":"Hi Thanks for choosing healthcare magic, Turkey baster or a syringe technique is almost equal to intercourse and even a little less than that .This method is an alternative to induction method done in the hospital. But the difference is that in the hospital, the collected sperm is subjected to certain procedures to obtain only the sperm cells, which increases the chances of fertilisation and to remove the other fraction that may cause problem to the cervix when loaded directly. In intercourse only the sperm cells swim across the vagina to the cervix the remaining fraction remains away from cervix So through turkeybaster you collect the full sperm and the fraction that cause problem to cervix can’t be separated, which is a drawback. Sperm collection in condoms that have spermicidal actions may kill the sperm, which wastes all the efforts you take to implement this technique And moreover it is a sterile technique when done in a hospital. when conducted at home, you are more prone to infections. Still some medical personnel may recommend this ,but with a proper guidance .So it is up to you to decide the benefits. In your case, I suggest you to meet a doctor, because already it has been 9 years without kids and moreover your age is also more. so wasting  more time with these things without ruling out the cause is not advisable in your case. you need to undergo minimum tests to find the cause so talk to the doctor about the finances and insurance and take steps accordingly.

Provided there are no other problems your fertility shouldnt be a problem.But your husbands case will depend on how successful the reversal will be. IVF is definitely more expensive.

Right tube not opacified. Left tube opacified with peritoneal spillage. my question is is there any problem for pregnancy? if yes, then what is the remedy of this problem?","Doctor":"Hello Thank you for your query. Your HSG shows that your right tube is blocked ( not open ). This definitely is  a problem for pregnancy, because with only one Fallopian tube open, chances of pregnancy are diminished. The further treatment depends on many factors. Your age, semen analysis of your partner, your ovulation studies and your hormonal tests. Pregnancy is technically possible with one tube open, however, since you are trying for 2 years now, please consult an Infertility Specialist and undergo the above evaluation. In presence of any abnormality, you should consider a hysteroscopy and laparoscopy, as HSG is not 100 % confirmatory and during laparoscopy, attempt can be made to open the blocked tube. If the laparoscopy also confirms tubal disease, you can go in for IVF/ IUI as per the results. take care."},{"Patient":"I had sex 2 times the same night, we always use a condom and withdrawal, also the first time i used spermicide, but not the second time (about 2hours later).

I thank you for posting your query here and I'm definitely going to help you out.. I am really sorry for your state but here I'm to tell confidently that you will not be pregnant, do not worry.. I being a surgeon, we encounter so many such cases day in and day out.. I read your question completely and have understood it well enough.. I will analyze all your points below.. 1. You had unprotected sex 2 times and you used spermicides too.. Well, that itself tells you. There's no chance of pregnancy with the use of spermicidal agents.. And even though you didn't use for 2nd time, it's effective. 2. Condom breakage is the most common problem encountered. But reading, your menstrual cycles I can say with certainty that you are safe.! 3. One day earlier completing periods again is the most important history. Generally, ovulation occurs 14 days after completion of periods. Especially in your 26 to 28 day cycle. So 100% there's no chance of ovulation and hence pregnancy even if he had ejaculated completely into your vagina! 4. No need for any kind of pill. Just chill and be happy.. 5. And convey my regards to your doctor too.. Hope this helps, in case you need any further assistance, please let me know... Take care and be happy.

Lutera is an oral contraceptive made up of two active hormonal ingredients:levonorgestrel and ethinyl estradiol which are progesterone and estrogens. Lutera works by preventing ovulation and consequently prevents pregnancy. Reduction in the amount of menstrual bleeding is very possible with hormonal pills and irregularities in menstrual have been noted in some cases. However, fertility is maintain and on your part there should be no problem. On your husband's part, his fertility would not be 100% as before but if the vasectomy reversal was done accurately and within 10 years from the time of the vasectomy he still has a more than  50% chance of his initial fertility. thanks and if you do have more questions, do not hesitate."},{"Patient":"Hi My hubby is 41 and I m 35.

Fertisure M and F are supplements in the form of anti oxidants which would help you conceive. There are no side effects. At 35, you should consider consulting an Infertility Specialist and going for detailed testing. Your complete hormonal profile is essential. Ovulation studies and follicular monitoring should be done. Your ovarian reserve ( capacity to produce mature eggs ) should be tested at 35. Your husband's semen analysis is extremely vital test. Also, just an HSG might not be sufficient, and you might need a hysteroscopy and laparoscopy to assess tubal damage and tubal patency.

My partner is nearly 47 years old and we are young at heart and physically fit for our age. My partner only has one testicle due to his other one being strangulated a few years ago. I have regular periods and have used a test to see if i am ovulating..which i am. Is it possible for me to get pregnant at my age? How can we improve our chances? Would we have any choices in relation to having IVF , due to our age? How can i tell if my eggs are still healthy? I would prefer to use my own eggs..is this possible? Thank you for your help.","Doctor":"Hello At 46, you are obviously aware that conception will be difficult, if not impossible. IVF is the only way ahead for you. Your partner's semen analysis is essential due to the testicular injury. Also, you can assess your egg forming capacity by testing your ovarian reserve. This is done by estimating AFC ( antral follicular count ) on ultrasound, measuring hormones like AMH ( anti mullerian hormone ) and FSH and LH on day 2. This would tell you if your own eggs can be used for IVF Your endometrial status needs to assessed for IVF also. Please consult a reputed Infertility Specialist and go for detailed testing and evaluation at the earliest, kindly do not waste more time. Take care."},{"Patient":"hi i m neha gupta from india. i have PCOD problem ,trying to consive from last two year ,i cunsult with doctor she gave me three month course of tablets like krimson 35,and glycomate SR.

It is true that it is too early for ovulation to occur, but taken that you had a 28-day cycle this time, you could as well be ovulating early-that is one possibility. You should consult your gynecologist and get a trans-vaginal ultrasound done to see if the ovaries and tubes are normal; you may also need a local examination. You may also exclude renal causes as similar pain can be observed in urinary infections, presence of calculi etc. Wish you good health."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, I am taking MR. Met 500 and Myotol F twice daily. Previously I took ginette 35 for past 3 months( from sep to december) and MR Met 500. After 3 months I am taking MR. Met 500 and Myotol F twice daily. I want to know how long I should take this table to coneive. I got married on 2012 june. Husband and myself are worring for a baby. Please reply","Doctor":"Hi, You did not say if you are suffering from polycystic ovaries. Ginette is an oral contraceptive combination used as the first course in the treatment of PCOD to regularize the cycles. Metformin is the drug which can be continued throughout the treatment including during pregnancy as it enhances ovulation by reducing the insulin resistance of the body. Myotol is a nutritional supplement and this can be taken for as long as needed. After having your cycles regularized, you may be put on ovulation induction and this goes on for at least 6 cycles, and if you fail to conceive in this period, you will be put on other methods of ART. Good luck."},{"Patient":"my husband and i are trying to have a baby. my last period started on jan 18th. my cycle is 32 days. ovulation discharge almost always happens on cd 18 19. this month we had sex according to the fertility calendar on the most fertile days and on the big flower day (ovulation) and i feel different because first of all when we had sex there was a whole lot of wet secretions, like a whole lot of stretchy thick mucus and he said i felt different in general, softer, and i felt it also. and now cd 20 im having slight sharp pain, and i continue to have a regular very clear, very stretchy, egg yolk like every time i use the restroom. i wipe and its on the toilet paper. could i be pregnant or am i just still ovulating? is it possible to still get pregnant?","Doctor":"Both the possibilities of pregnancy and ovulation are there or it could be just infection,if its only the discharge not smelling or itching or anything it is less likely to be infection.

Recently i consulted her and she has given me Ovacare forte with APCOD. I keep on putting weight though i go for walking (not ver regular) but have food control. Is there any chance of me concieving? Am worried","Doctor":"Hi, thanks for using healthcare magic It is possible to conceive with PCOS, it is just more difficult, but with the technology and procedures that exist today, conception is definitely possible. You are right in trying to lose weight , this would increase the chances of conception. It is easier to lose weight by modifying your diet because usually by altering a few things that are use calories can be reduced by 500 calories.It would take alot of exercise to achieve this same amount of calorie deficit. Exercise is important in general fitness and keeping weight off. To lose weight you would need to cut out all sodas and fruit drinks and use water instead. Use low carb fruits and vegetables as snacks. In terms of your other meals you can choose the low fat or low carb route.In the low carb route you would: Increase the amount of low carb fruits and/or vegetables that you use with your main meals and at the same time reduce the amount of carbohydrates to a minimum (pasta/rice/flour products/bread/biscuits/cereals/potatoes). There are lists of low carb foods available online. In the low fat route you would reduce fat used (fatty meats/frying/butter/certain oils/ high fat milk or cheeses or dressings/mayonaise), increase fruits and vegetables, use alot of water. Metformin has also been used in PCOS. This medication is used to reduce the insulin resistance associated with PCOS, help with weight loss and improve fertility.It is one of the most common drugs used in PCOS. You can consider speaking to your doctor about it. In addition, if with weight loss and metformin you still have difficulties, clomid can be used. This medication, again very widely available, helps with ovulation. If clomid  does not work then there are other medications that assist with ovulation. You may want to consider visiting a fertility specialist. Hope this helps"},{"Patient":"March 13th i had anal sex. when he came inside after about ten seconds i got up. i felt a gooey liquid all over. he said it was from my vagina and my butt. i couldn't tell what it was so i immediately wiped my butt and vagina. if it be that his cum did touch my vagina, how likely is it that i'm pregnant. also, my period is supposed to start sometime around March 26th.","Doctor":"Hi and welcome to HCM..

Take it from me with certainty.. 2. Again, we see so many such cases where the couple worry of pregnancy by just contact of semen with vagina. No, it's again just a myth. Semen has to go deep inside vagina. So do not worry.. 3. You immediately wiped that secretion, whatever it is? So again, need not worry about pregnancy.. You have done your best. 4.

It is advisable to lie still for at least half-an-hour on your back if you have an anteverted uterus and on your abdomen in the prone position if you have a retroverted uterus. Do not wash your soft parts with strong solutions as they are going to harm the sperms deposited, just use plain water if you need it.

The delay in your periods is not likely to be due to ovulation inducing agent- clomid. It is likely to be related to a mild hormonal disturbance and stress or anxiety.

Some situations are familial, but most of them can be treated with modern medicine, so you need not worry at all.

Last year August I stopped the pill as my husband and I have decided to have a baby.

Today day 13 I had tested again for ovulation and negative again. Is there something wrong with me?","Doctor":"Hello Thank you for your query. Sometimes, return to ovulation after stopping birth control pills ( particularly since you have been using it for years ) might take upto a few months. Hormonal tests can confirm if this is so. Also, you might be suffering from PCOS ( polycystic ovarian syndrome ), in which case the hormonal imbalance is caused by multiple small follicles in the ovaries, none of which ovulate, resulting in irregular cycles and anovulation. Thyroid hormone disorder, anxiety, stress, rapid fluctuations in weight etc also might cause such a picture. You need detailed hormonal evaluation, ultrasound, biochemical tests to confirm the diagnosis. Consult an infertility specialist / endocrinologist for the same. Also, since you are having irregular cycles, you might be having delayed ovulation/ no ovulation. It is better to undergo follicular monitoring instead of repeated ovulation tests. Take care."},{"Patient":"I ended up having sex the last day of my period which was 2 weeks ago. I was wondering if it would be possible to get pregnant then, and if so when would I have to test.

I will briefly outline a work up which you can then follow, in consultation with  a reputed Infertility specialist. 1. Thorough evaluation of previous abortion. Ideally, the abortus tissue should have been sent for chromosomal analysis. You should be evaluated for genetic defects alongwith your partner, hormonal deficiencies, uterine anomalies, autoimmune causes, infections etc - as these lead to abortions. 2. Basic laboratory workup - complete blood count, viral markers, hormones like LH, FSH, TSH . 3. Tests for ovarian reserve - pelvic ultrasound with antral follicular count, AMH, follicular study documenting ovulation. 4. Semen analysis of your partner 5. Fallopian tube testing, ideally in the form of a hystero laparoscopy. Based on the abnormalities detected on this workup, you should go for natural cycles/ ovulation inducing agents/ or ART ( assisted reproductive technologies ) in the form of IUI or IVF. Take folic acid supplements, maintain a healthy, active lifestyle, maintain a healthy BMI, and do not yield to stress/ anxiety."},{"Patient":"I came off depot after 10 years (because of bad endo) in April 2012 because I want to have a baby and no periods as yet, had laparoscopy and dye test in my tubes - tubes patent, endo all gone but have congested pelvis . been given a 7 day course of Norethisterone which I finished last night - when can I expect a bleed and is this likely to jump start my ovaries back into action??

After Norethisterone, you should have a period within 2 - 3 days, but maximum within a week. After depo, you should be having regular periods within some months maximum. Norethisterone does not jump start your ovaries into action :) Fertility depends on the tubes of course, which are fine. However, endometriosis itself affects pelvic blood supply, quality of eggs produced and also your uterine lining. Plus, you have to consider your partner's semen analysis, and your ovulation.

It has a success rate of 10% over a period of 6 months. As you are using a glass receptacle and a disposable syringe, it is safe. Also, use sterile gloves during the procedure. Freshly ejaculated semen should be collected and when it dries down after 30 minutes, the procedure is performed. It would be better if your husband can perform this, as this would be easier.

What I could understand from your question is you had some uterine infection for which you took antibiotic and now it is better.You want to concieve and  your Doctor has advised you to take canesteen 3 hours before intercourse..Canesteen is Fluconazole which is an antifungal medicine used to fungal infection and yeast infection of vagina.It can help in concieving only if you have vaginal infection and your Doctor think this vaginal infection is responsible for infertality,otherwise it has no role in fertality. Medicine for fertality  depend upon the cause and there are hundreds of causes of infertality and there is no single medicine which can be prescibed for concieving. Both you and your husband need to be investigated for causes of infertality and only then medicicine can prescribed depending upon the cause of infertality. I wouuld suggest you to consult a gynaecologist who will be able to investigate both of you and may prescribe medicine accordingly,if needed.

Owing to your age, as you are in the perimenopausal group, chances of getting natural pregnancy are lesser as ovulation tends to dwindle at this stage. Moreover, a pregnancy at this age should be taken up very carefully owing to the risks of anomalies likely to develop in the fetus. Please discuss with your gynecologist for further advice. Good luck."},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, My wife is taking Valparin Chrono 500mg tablet from past 8yrs. We married last year and now planning for the child. We just wanted to know what needs to be taken care at this time. The doctor who had treated my wife is not available for the next 2 months. Hence seeking your support to answer us. Thank you Deepu","Doctor":"Hello and welcome to Healthcare Magic. Thanks for your query. Valparin Chrono is an ant-epileptic medication, which is used commonly for the treatment of seizure disorders as well as a mood stabilizer - to treat psychiatric disorders. Taking Valparin in pregnancy can slightly increase the risk of congenital defects in the baby. However, the decision whether to continue the medication or not will depend on the nature of your illness for which it has been prescribed. So, please discuss this with your doctor before making any treatment decisions. Taking Folic acid supplements can decrease the risk of problems to the fetus due to Valparin. Wish you all the best.

Thanks for your query. Durian fruit contains a high amount of sugar, vitamin C, potassium, and the serotonergic amino acid tryptophan. It is a good source of carbohydrates, proteins, and fats. It is claimed to have several medicinal effects, but there is no medical evidence that it helps in conception. You can keep track of the fertile periods in your cucle, in order to maximize the chances of conception. If you have been having infertility for more than a year after marriage, then it would be advisable to consult a gynecologist for a detailed evaluation. Wish you all the best.

Boost your immune system by eating a healthy diet, including plenty of fresh fruits and vegetables. Too much stress is known to weaken the immune system.

So once you put nuvaring in the hormonal changes have already begun,and if you take it out in the middle of the cycle you can get your periods anytime due to hormonal imbalance.

In your case follicular growth is increasing normally. It is about 2mm/day. On day 15 R.O-13mm might be subjective error or ovulation has occurred with irregular follicular shape. Ovulation usually occurs on 14 th day when follicle size is between 18-22mm. ET(endometrial thickness) of 7.5 is good. What i recommend you is to continue folliculometry till your follicle size is between 18-22mm followed by hcg inj. Chances of conception per cycle after ovulation is 18-22%. good luck, regards, Dr Nilofer"},{"Patient":"Hello Dr, I am 30yrs married lady. I am trying to get conceive for past 1 year. My Dr advised me to take the follicular study to monitor the egg growth. The size of the follicle at my 14th day is right Ovary is 10mm x 5mm and left ovary is 11mm x 7mm when will I ovulate .? My cycle length is 28 – 30 days and I have regular periods . Thanks for your Valuable Suggestions.","Doctor":"Hello, Thanks for the query. Ideal size of follicle during ovulation is 19mm-23mm. But let me also tell you that follicle increases by 1-2mm every day, so just relax and let your Doc have you on follicular monitoring for few more days. Ovulation usually occurs between 14th to 20th day. Continue taking folic acid, Eat healthy, reduce weight if you are overweight, exercise regularly. Stay hopeful..... All the best! regards, Dr Nilofer"},{"Patient":"My husband and I are trying to become pregnant. My period came on Dec.27th but we had sex 4 days prior. And also Dec.28th, no Dec Dec.30th but we did have sex Jan.1st till Jan. 5th. According to charts my fertile days was the 5th & 6th and I started ovulating the 10th. Today makes the 4th day past ovulation and I have been receiving white milky discharge . I was wondering what are my chances and when should we have sex to conceive.","Doctor":"Hi, In a normal 28-30 day cycle, ovulation occurs around 14-16 days. Since the ovum remains viable for 24 hours after ovulation and sperms have a relatively better viability, intercourse around this period stands a very good chance of conception. The fertile period, as this is called falls around the 11-18 days of the cycle. Milky white discharge often is seen in the post-ovulatory phase of the cycle as well as in early conception period.

My tenderness to my breast is still their and I m 6 days away from my cycle, and I haven t been able to concieve since 2007, What do you think these symptoms mean? Might I be pregnant? I had I.U.D. placed in after my last pregnancy but it was difficult to have them remove the I.U.D. after 2 years on being implanted inside me. I had to be put to sleep to get it taking out because it hurt so much it made me cry. After that I have been unable to get pregnant this far.","Doctor":"Hi, Breast tenderness could be due to the water logging post-ovulation. Sore throat could be seasonal. You can get a blood test done to be sure about any chance of getting pregnant as HPTs at this stage may not always give a positive result as they are not so sensitive. Ideally, you should wait for your period before taking the next step. If you have failed to conceive after removal of IUD, and that too with difficulty, you should get investigated for secondary infertility, including uterine condition, patency of the tubes and so on. Please get further advice from your doctor.

Thanks for writing to us. The mild irregular bleeding and spotting that you are having is more likely to be due to the side effect of the depo shot that you took in the month of November.

I haven t have any signs of pregnancy though, just a feel of nausea but never throwing up, being extremely irritable, bloating/ cramps . They could simply be PMS . Is there any chance that I could be pregnant?","Doctor":"Hi, Firstly, you can get a HPT done after avoiding any contamination of the sample. If it is positive, then you should consult your gynecologist for a checkup,blood test and a sonogram if needed to assess the situation. Urine color does not change in pregnancy unless it is high colored due to dehydration. Since, you have abnormal blood flow, it could be a threatened pregnancy, given your associated symptoms as nausea is not much a part of PMS. Please get further suggestions from your doctor.

I have my periods now and can I take the tablets Fertisure F?","Doctor":"Hello Thanks for your query. Yes, you can take the tablets during periods. You should have a nutritious diet and active lifestyle, as you are already taking supplements in the form of these tablets.

Your chances of conception depend on the ability to ovulate, normal tubal function and uterine response. If everything is normal, you stand pretty good chances of getting pregnant.

Doctor suggeted me to have Oosure, for 3 months and reduce on my weight, will this help in conceiving, Please suggest,","Doctor":"Hello, PCOS is very tricky problem and requires a long treatment. Loosing weight is very important to regain fertility in a patient of PCOS. It is said that even if you are able to shed 10% of your weight,you hall be able to get your periods back. To shed weight Take low carbohydrate and high protein diet Do regular aerobic exercises like brisk walking or swimming or cycling And you should take medicines to balance your body hormones like birth control pills The most important aspect of treatment is use of insulin sensitising medicine called as METFORMIN. Since patients of PCOS have incresed insulin resistance ,you need METFORMIN to reduce the insulin resistance. Insulin resistance causes a build up of insulin and sugar levels in the blood which results in Increased production of male hormones in body. These increased levels of male hormones result in acne,infertility and WEIGHT GAIN. Consult a Gynecologist or a physician and start taking METFORMIN 500 mg twice a day,under his advise,for at least 6 months. Thanks"},{"Patient":"I had a surgery for my felopian tubes in september.

I hope you had follicular monitoring with all previous cycles of clomiphene therapy. One method of treatment involves clomiphene citrate (Clomid or Serophene) taken in pill form for 5 days at the beginning of a cycle. For women whose only infertility problem is anovulation, up to 80% of patients will ovulate using this medication and 50% of those will conceive . This success rate improves with HMG ( gonadotropins ) Your follicular monitoring seems normal this month, and you ovulated on time.

So, for you it has been only  3 months yet. Please remain positive, as stress and anxiety are chief reasons for hormonal imbalance, which leads to infertility. Also, for the past 4 years, if you have been using any hormonal contraception, it takes some time for the effects to wear off. Generally, one does not investigate infertility so early, but if you are very anxious, please try to conceive for 3 months more, and if you fail, consult an Infertility Specialist. You need to have your basic hormonal tests done, the semen analysis of your husband, and if you do not conceive for a longer period, then your fallopian tube patency should be tested. Meanwhile, if you have a regular menstrual cycle, please know that chances of conception are maximum around the time of ovulation, which should be day 14, since you have  a regular cycle. So, try and have intercourse alternate day / daily around day 10 - day 20 of your period, considering the first day of bleeding as day 1. You can keep track of your ovulation by temperature method, by analyzing cervical mucus or by ovulation kits which are available easily.

PCOS causes problems with ovulation and conceiving, and you need detailed investigations and treatment for that. Taking metformin and clomiphene is one way out, but if you do not respond to that, further treatment options in the form of gonadotropins ( injections ), IUI and IVF are also available. Also, you should have your other basic hormonal work up done, the semen testing of your partner should be done, and your fallopian tube patency should be assessed. At 23, you have years ahead of you in which to conceive, and modern treatments will definitely make it possible.

Thanks for writing to us. In PCOS, it is common to have delayed periods due to the hormonal disturbance. Usually after stopping regesterone, the periods start in 72 hours.

PCOD ( polycystic ovarian disease ) is one of the most common conditions affecting women in reproductive age group. It is characterized by multiple small follicles in the ovaries, of which none ovulate, and hence, pregnancy is a problem ALongwith you may have other conditions like diabetes, insulin resistance, increased androgens in the body etc and irregular periods. Please follow an Infertility Specialist, and have your complete workup for PCOD done which includes FSH, LH, adrenal hormones, thyroid profile and blood sugars. Also, your partners semen testing is essential. What was the pattern during the previous IUI ? Did you successfully ovulate? If not you need further medication/injections to help you ovulate. Since you are 26, you have time on your side. Please go for tubal patency testing  ( laparoscopy ) as advised and then for further IUI./ IVF. Please remember that weight reduction and an active, healthy lifestyle are the key factors to control PCOD. Take care"},{"Patient":"Hi Dr. Lundi, I ve just undergone an IUI . My doctor has prescribed naturogest 200 (micronised natural progesterone ) vaginal pessaries for me, as a follow up to the procedure, to increase chances of conception . I am supposed to use these pessaries twice a day. I just wanted to know whether these pessaries have to be inserted as close to the cervix as possible or just simple vaginal insertion is enough. Also, do these pessaries have any undesirable side effects? Thanks, Monica","Doctor":"Hello Thanks for your query. The pessaries should be inserted as high up in the vaginal canal as you can, because the chances of their being effective increases. Also, it is a normal pregnancy support, commonly given after IUI, as progesterone supports the early pregnancy during development. there are no gross side effects, you might feel vaginal itching and discomfort. Take care."},{"Patient":"I am a married person & three years have gone, but after having many inter courses my wife has not yet conceived.

Last month I had unsual period, heavy in the first two days, after so light, after stayed normal for a day and finished earlier than usual (6 days). I am trying for a baby with my partner, I had ovulated on the 24-29of december, and the period i described started on the 13th of dec. i had few signs as cramping, higher body tempreture for two days after ovulation , and i did have sex 3x in my ovulation period.

Thanks for writing to us. To know about your pregnancy, you can get serum Beat HCG evaluated as soon as 10 days after ovulation.

While it is possible that folic acid can boost your fertility, it is also important to begin taking it before conception for health reasons. Taking folic acid before pregnancy is important for your baby's health. It helps prevent neural tube defects such as spina bifida, which occurs when the spinal column does not close to protect the spinal cord, and anencephaly, which occurs when the brain does not develop completely. FOLIC acid creates a very healthy atmosphere in the uterus for the growing baby. Although taking folic acid can improve your chances of getting pregnant and provides important benefits for your developing baby, you should not consume more than 1,000 mcg of folic acid a day. Too much folic acid can hide signs that you're lacking vitamin B-12, which can lead to nerve damage. Minor side effects of FOLIC acid are nausea,bloating,gas etc. While rare side effects include hives,difficulty in breathing,swelling of lips,face and tongue. Thanks"},{"Patient":"Hi, I am 30 yrs old female. Last year I got married. Since then we were planning to have a baby. Never used any contraceptions. Both got tested and found normal and also we had one round of councelling on positions etc. Now Doctor has suggested Plancentrex inj. (IM) 2mL on alternate days to me for inproving the thickness of endometrium and egg size. Can I get conceived now?","Doctor":"Hi, Placentrex is an extract of human placenta used for tissue regeneration and repair. Its use is restricted to the genuine cases as it is a human derivative with the risk of serious anaphylactic reactions. Endometrial thickness can also be improved by using hormones. Good endometrial thickness is necessary for proper conception, but conception can occur only if there is proper ovulation and timely fertilization without any male hindrance. Since your reports are normal, you can expect to get pregnant any time now. Good luck."},{"Patient":"hi, i am trying to have baby & visited to doctor for the same also she gave me some madicins for 1 month then after thet my due date of periods was 28 which is not come till 2nd so i visited to doctor again she checked pregnancy through kit which shows negative. so she advised me Registrone 5 mg . do this will help me if i am pregnant since i have still not got my periods.","Doctor":"hello, There are several reasons of delayed/missed period like hormonal imbalance,stress/anxiety,ovarian cyst/PCOD,thyroid problem,wt gain/extreme loss,irregular eating habits etc. Need to investigate properly to rule out underlying pathology by USG lower abdomen,Thyroid profile, LH/FSH etc.You may clear doubt by doing blood test for B-hcg to exclude pregnancy. Tab Regestrone is a progesterone tab and helpful in regularize period or commencing withdrawal bleeding within 7 days of stopping. To conceive,do unprotected sex around ovulation time for highest possibility of pregnancy.Ovulation occurs approx 14 days prior to due date.

You should have consulted a proper infertility specialist by now, I hope you have. the phenomenon that you mention is entirely normal. It is very natural for some seminal fluid to get discharged, however, for fertilization, please remember that only a handful of sperms are required. If she doesnt immediately get up after intercourse, the necessary amount has already entered the vaginal and cervical canal. ALso, please make sure the basic laboratory tests, necessary hormonal tests, sperm counts, fallopian tube testing etc has been done. Sometimes, there is  a condition called unexplained infertility, for which you should not give up, but keep trying the avenues of ART ( assisted reproductive technology ) under guidance of a Specialist Infertility practitioner.

He ejaculated somewhere else but he had pre-* during the rubbing. What are the possibilities of getting pregnant this way? The last time he ejaculated was one day before we did (Monday). I took plan B approx 48 hours after the process just in case.","Doctor":"Hello Thanks for the query If you have had an episode of unprotected intercourse, even during your ' safe ' period, theoretically, there are always chances of pregnancy. Moreover, even the pre ejaculatory fluid sometimes contains active sperms , hence you should always use a permanent, reliable method of contraception in future. As for now, taking the emergency contraceptive pill within 48 hours will protect against pregnancy, however , it is not 100 % effective, and it is more effective if taken within 24 hours. So, for the time being, use a contraceptive, and wait for your period. If delayed by a week, go for pregnancy testing and appropriate medical advice for termination Take care."},{"Patient":"Hi Dr!

I want baby........pls sujjest me....now my dr sujjest me IUI tets is it good for me? Kindly advice...thanks in advance.","Doctor":"Hello. I'm sorry you're having difficulty getting pregnant. If you're taking Bigomet, I presume you've been diagnosed with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). Without treatment, it's usually difficult for women with PCOS to conceive and carry a pregnancy to term due to the hormonal problems and metabolic abnormalities associated with this disorder. With treatment, however, your chance for conceiving and having a baby is quite good if you're under age 35. The question that must be answered for each patient is which treatment is most likely to be effective, and this is an issue that only you and your doctor can determine. Some women respond to metformin (Bigomet) alone, others conceive with the help of medications that enhance ovulation, and still others require in vitro fertilization (IVF) or intrauterine insemination (IUI). If you have questions about why your doctor thinks IUI would be best for you, I suggest you talk to him/her. Good luck!"},{"Patient":"Hi !

When the doctor performed the laparoscopy, I would think that they would have done a test at the same time to see if the fallopian tubes were all right or not. If the doctor said that the tubes were patent( that is, not blocked), there is good chance of your getting pregnant. If your periods are regular and you have monthly cycles, it would mean that you are ovulating, and that would mean a good chance of pregnancy as well. However, if you don't get pregnant in the next one year, do go back and see a gynecologist with interest in fertility. The doctor would order a few other tests and advice you if you would need help in getting pregnant like IVF.

I had unprotected sexual intercourse with my husband yesterday and then i took for the first time the cerazette pill the next day (24 hours late). I just want to ask if i am still safe not to get pregnant ? thank you","Doctor":"Hello Thanks for the query. Actually, partial breast feeding might cause absence of periods, but it does not guarantee that you would not ovulate . Plus, taking cerazette 24 hours AFTER unprotected intercourse does NOT protect against pregnancy. Cerazette has to be taken regularly daily, and then too for the first month, a backup method of family planning is always advised. Instead, you could have tried taking the emergency contraceptive pill. Anyways, for the time being, you can use a barrier method ( condom etc ) , and get yourself checked by a gynecologist after 3 weeks for any possible pregnancy. Just one act of unprotected intercourse , that too while breastfeeding, puts you at low risk of pregnancy. Once you have your check up, you can ask her to prescribe proper contraceptive pills for you, after assessing you.

Kindly advice for positive result.","Doctor":"Hello, Your sperm motility is just 30% and that is definitely low. A semen analysis in which greater than 50 percent of sperm are motile and moving forward is considered normal. While there is no definitive \\"cure\\" for low motility, some men find that dietary and lifestyle changes can be helpful. Stress, smoking and alcohol can contribute to poor sperm health. So can excessive exercise that puts stress and heat on the testicles and scrotum, such as too much biking or too much time in the spa or hot tub. Taking supplements and consuming foods rich in Vitamin C, Vitamin B12, zinc, Vitamin E, selenium and L-carnitine might prove beneficial. It is very difficult to give any time frame during which sperm motility can be increased.however you keep up with your supplements therapy along with lifestyle changes and wait for few months. If this becomes successful then it will be good however,if conception doesn't take place then this not the end of world for you.In that event you may resort to artificial methods. Intrauterine insemination (IUI) and in vitro fertilization with intra cytoplasmic sperm injection (IVF with ICSI) have proven to help with sperm motility issues. Have patience and keep in touch with your doctor regularly.You will definitely succeed.

Scrotal doppler is done to see if there is presence of varicocele.if necessary the doctor can take fnac(biopsy). A man's semen count can vary feom time to time.as for now , i advice your husband should consult a general surgeon who will conduct a local examination on his testicles.if required he will advice you for a semen culture.your husband should involve in brisk walk for 30- 45 minutes each day and should wear loose underwears.this will help in improving the sperm count and motility. Important- a semen analysis should be conducted after atleast 3 days of abstinance and the sample should be processedwithin half an hour.if the sample was collected at home and later taken for test,chances are that the sample gets destroyed and gives false test report.in such a case ,a repeat examination should be done."},{"Patient":"HI , I AM 29 AND HUBBY IS 36 YRS OLD.

Women may have no bleeding and when tested, the pregnancy could have failed. On the other hand, you can have significant bleeding, with no effect on the pregnancy whatsoever.

Regards,"},{"Patient":"Hi, I am Manasa.I am 26 yrs old.I have PCOS but my periods come every 33-35 days.My all other medical tests came out normal.My husband s medical tests also are normal.We tried to conceive normally for 6 months but couldn t.So I went to a Gynecologist and she asked me to use Siphene 50mg twice daily from Day 3 to Day 7 of my cycle and did sonography to check how my follicles are growing and to see when are they completely grown.On Day 15 my follicles (Rt Ovary 20x20 mm Lt Ovary 20x20, 18x18, 21x20, 19x19) are completely grown so my doctor gave me Decapeptyl 0.1mg shot and asked us to have intercourse on Day 16, 17, 18 and 19.On Day 18 my follicles got ruptured except one on Lt ovary of 18x18 mm size.My endometrium was 11 mm on Day 18.She also asked me to take Dubagest 200 mg vaginal tabs from Day 20 to Day 27.But that month didn t happen.Next month my doctor asked me to follow the same medication but this time no Decapeptyl.That month I grew a cyst on my Lt ovary.So i went to another Gynecologist next month where she did abdominal sonography and said there is no cyst and couldn t continue with that doctor because she is not available all the week.So on 5th month i came back to the previous doctor and did sonography as suggested by her and they found a cyst of 16x14 mm sizeon Lt ovary.So she asked me to take Novelon 21 tabs.By tomorrow i will finish my 21 tabs.Now I am not understanding about what is happening in me, what is she trying to do?Is this process correct or is she just trying to squeeze all my money for tests?Because except PCOS all other lab reports came out normal.My husband is perfect.But why is it getting delayed? Thank you in advance.","Doctor":"Hello I appreciate your query. What your doctor did makes perfect sense. Please do not doubt her intentions. You seem to be having polycystic ovarian disease She gave you clomiphene to stimulate growth of follicles, and gave you decapeptyl for rupturing mature follicles. dubagest is given for luteal phase support after follicular monitoring, and ovulation induction, which you went through. After two cycles of clomiphene stimulation, it is a common side effect to have ovarian cyst, as clomiphene stimulates the ovaries to produce more than physiological number of follicles. Abdominal sonography might not have picked up small ovarian cysts. Novelon is an oral contraceptive pill, which is given for resolution of ovarian cysts. So , the treatment protocol you have undergo sounds perfectly reasonable. However, I would advise you certain things. Consult an infertility specialist first. Also, do not undergo more blind stimulation with ovulation inducing agents, without first going in for tubal testing ( testing whether your tubes are open or not - can be in the form of a diagnostic hysteroscopy and laparoscopy ) If the tubes are open, next time, go for clomiphene with or without injections ( gonadotropins ) and go for IUI ( intrauterine insemination ) which will maximize your chances of conception. If the fallopian tubes are blocked, you naturally will have to resort to IVF ( in vitro fertilization) Do not waste more time Keep your mental state stable, as these treatments and tests are expensive. Above all, keep faith in your practitioner. Exercise regularly and de stress yourself All the very best."},{"Patient":"hello i am 26 yrs married 3 yrs last month i been through laproscopy ovary drilling done doc found water in uterus it was tb infection so doc put me on 9 month course of akt 4 and 3 and other medicine so i want now can i concive iduring this period doc said u try u will get concive so i ned to now wht other doc hav to say and one more thg after taking this tb medicine i feel vomit headache when i see food i feel like pukeing and nausea plz help","Doctor":"Hello I appreciate your query. Ovarian drilling is generally done for a condition called polycystic ovarian disease , which interferes with your ability to ovulate ( produce mature ovum - egg every menstrual cycle ). Also , you have not mentioned one important laparoscopic finding, that is, whether your tubes were found to be open or blocked. Moreover, for conception, you need to have your husband's semen analysis. Your routine blood tests, hormonal profile for polycystic ovaries, TSH, blood sugars etc. After two months of starting AKT, you can safely go in for conception, that is, try for it. AKT is frequently associated with the symptoms you describe, that is nausea, and aversion to food. Try not to stay hungry for long, take small frequent meals and antacids if required. You might be having polycystic ovaries, so for planning conception, you may need ovulation induction agents. Please consult an infertility specialist at the earliest. All the best."},{"Patient":"I need a Gynaecologist suggestions. I was taken homepregnancy test yesterday. My last period time Sep 30th. I had taken VELOCIT homepregnancy test kit.

So no need to worry this early. If ovulation kit was positive around 3 weeks after the period , then probably you will have your periods after 5 weeks of  previous period. Because period occurs exactly 14 days after ovulation.So if you ovulated after 3 weeks , still there is time. You may recheck for pregnancy test after 2 weeks if you dont get your period.  Some harmone withdrawl symptoms may occur after removal but nothing serious. Best of luck and take care.. Hope it helps  you.."},{"Patient":"Hi, Im a 27 year old married lady.

This is generally Day 14 if you have a 28 day cycle, so day 10 - Day 17 are your fertile days. Apart from that, you need to get your husband's semen analysis done. You should have your routine blood tests, thyroid profile, blood sugar levels, hormonal tests, serum prolactin etc., and an internal check up . TVS is also important, however your report seems to be normal Slightly bulky left ovary does not signify anything, unless your report is suggestive of polycystic ovarian disease, which interferes with ovulation. Inspite of all normal reports, if you fail to conceive, then you should go for some form of tubal testing, either a hysterosalpingogram or a diagnostic hysteroscopy and laparoscopy. If tubal block is present, you need ART ( assisted reproductive technologies ) to help you. Please mention your age. Do not lose hope, as today there are various modalities of treatment to help you further. Please consult an infertility specialist.

Leakage of semen after sex is very normal, so no problem regarding that. And chances of pregnancy in one month even in perfectly normal couple  is also only 25%.

A doctor's examination of the clot you passed, preferably by histopathological examination. 2. A blood pregnancy test. OR 3. An ultrasound that clearly showed a pregnancy in the uterus. If any of the above was positive, then yes, you did have a miscarriage and it is best to go back to the doctor to see why you are still bleeding. The cause can only be ascertained by a clinical examination and blood tests and an ultrasound scan. However, if none of the above was done, the possibility of pregnancy in the first place itself is questionable and you may just be having irregular periods. In any case, go and see your doctor and hopefully you will find an answer. The possibility of twins and miscarriage of one twin can is there, but till you see your doctor and have a scan, these are all merely speculations.

However, it seems that you have not had any assessment of the cavity of the uterus, like hysterosalpingogram or hysteroscopy. These tests would give a better indication as to the issue of pregnancy. As you are already 42 years of age, and reproductive capacity decreases with age, I would advice you to see a gynecologist with interest in infertility as soon as possible.

You must be taking medications for the IVF luteal phase support, hence the other symptoms are non specific. You must monitor your blood pressure as that could cause dizziness, as well as the medications for dizziness. As for the chances of your pregnancy, your infertility consultant could tell you how well your IVF cycle went. Also, the type of bleeding that you described does not rule out your chances of conception after blastocyst transfer. You would know for sure only after your B-HCG levels are tested as recommended by your consultant, to know whether the IVF cycle was successful or not.

It has been associated with women's health. But as your all results are normal ( yours 'sand your husband's)  , i dont think there is any problem. However HSG is necessary  to see the status of your tubes. Some time subfertility remains unexplaiined in many cases. So keep hope and get proper treatment.

Now I already taken 3 Lupride Injections . Bleeding is occuring every 20 days after taken of Injection. Can I hv a chance to conceive in this month, Suggest me to YYYY@YYYY","Doctor":"Hi and welcome to the site. Chances of pregnancy would be much higher by doing in-vitro-fertilization. Most doctors are no longer recommending surgery to repair blocked tubes. The reason is that the surgery itself is very expensive. And results are not so good. Even if there is a pregnancy, there is a high risk that it will be in the tube. Money is better spent on in-vitro-fertilization. The women undergoes fertility treatments to get eggs. The eggs are taken and mixed with sperm. After fertilization, the embryo is placed into the uterus of the woman. Chances of successful pregnancy are much higher this way. I hope this information has been helpful."},{"Patient":"Hi I hv been trying to conceive for last two yrs all test are normal recently doc reported high tsh of 6.4 and suggested to take 25 mcg thyronorm for a month and go for test .

In case of regular periods it is very unusual to ovulate on the last day of periods. So you better plan intercourse around the time of your ovulation. This will increase the chance of conception.

We have a 4 year old son and also had another pregnancy before him which ended in a miscarriage at 7 weeks. I am 36 and my husband is 43. We have had all the tests and there does not seem to be anything physically wrong with us, just not lucky yet. We have also tried 4 rounds of natural IUI (no drugs). I went to see a doctor today (I live in China and the system here is strange as you never get to see the same doc) and found out that I had already ovulated this month so too late to do IUI (it is only D13 and I am very regular ovulating on day 14). She said it looked like I ovulated yesterday, so I could try intercourse today and see if we get lucky. Also working in our favour is that we had intercourse on Monday (3 days ago, possibly 2 days before ovulation ). So fingers crossed for a lucky break. My question: I asked her if progesterone supplements might improve my odds of pregnancy (as we are not sure if conception is occuring, but implementation is not), and she perscribed Utrogestan. I would like to try this as I want to have a bit more agressive approach to making it happen, but when I looked it up it says it should not be taken during pregnancy. As I am in China I don t have easy access to answer this type of question. Do you think it is a good idea to take it, given my situation? I would hate to take it if not necessary or potentially harmful, but if it could help, then I will take all the help that I can get. Thanks for your time and guidance.","Doctor":"Hello, Thanks for your query, Progesterone is given for luteal phase support  for progesterone deficiency in the second half of the cycle.It does not increases the chance of pregnancy, but it helps in sustaining the pregnancy after it occurs in patients with luteal phase defect or in patients with unexplained infertility.

Please Doc help me understand this all...","Doctor":"Hello, I appreciate your query. For understanding your TVS - HSG report, you need to understand in brief the process of fertilization. A female requires active functioning ovaries, from which mature follicles ( eggs ) are released every month. A healthy cervix and vagina is essential for sperm transport into the uterus and then , the fallopian tubes are responsible for transport of sperm and egg, and the fertilization occurs in the fallopian tube. The uterus is where the fertilized embryo will implant and develop. Now, coming to your report, the uterus appears normal Both ovaries are normal sized, but follicles ( eggs ) are seen only in the right one. The fallopian tubes appear to be open ( not blocked ) as dye has passed from them into the peritoneal cavity. However, to explain to you your chances of pregnancy, theoretically,yes you can get pregnant. However, the major deterrent is your age. How long have you been trying for conception ?? Have you had any surgery or disease in the past? At 45, the capacity of the ovaries to produce eggs is drastically reduced. That is the major factor that will impede pregnancy. For proper assessment of your ovarian reserve ( ability of ovaries to produce good quality eggs ), you should have a proper regular monthly menstrual cycle. Also, get your AMH ( Anti - Mullerian Hormone ), which reflects your ovarian reserve. Your AFC ( antral follicular count ) on ultrasound, is not mentioned, which also indicates your current ovarian reserve. If your ovarian reserve is depleted, chances of pregnancy fall quite  a lot. Also, a major factor is your partner/husband 's semen analysis report. Please get that done too, after 3 days of abstinence from sexual activity. With these investigations ( also ruling out thyroid, sugar and other conditions ), please consult an infertility practitioner in your area, as your case will be tremendously benefitted with the use of ART ( Assisted Reproductive Technology ) I urge you to actively pursue this at the earliest, as time is of the essence in your case. Hope this helped you."},{"Patient":"Hi my age is 32 Years, I had a follicle study done. It reads as follows ; 9th Day - ROF & LOF : No DF - ET : 5.6mm, Collection in POD : Free 11th Day - ROF & LOF : No DF - ET : 7mm, Collection in POD : Free 13th Day - ROF & LOF : No DF - ET : 8mm, Collection in POD : Free What does the above report indicate ? Is there any chance of getting pregnancy ?","Doctor":"Hi,I appreciate your queryI would clarify the report of your follicular study to you.On the 9th day, in the right and left ovaries ( ROF and LOF ) - there was no DF - which means, dominant follicle.Again the same findings persisted till the 13th day, that is there was no dominant follicle in any of the ovaries.ET - refers to endometrial thickness which was 8 mm on Day 13.Collection in POD was nil, which is normal.Now, to explain a normal follicular study to you.By day 9, the ovaries start producing dominant follicles, that is among the many eggs present in the ovaries, one starts maturing to develop into the dominant egg for that month.By day 13 generally, if you have a regular 28 day menstrual cycle, the dominant egg reaches a size of 20 - 22 mm.Generally on day 14, ovulation occurs, that is the mature dominant egg is released from the ovary, and it is then ready for fertilization by the sperm.This is the normal studyHowever, in your case, there is no dominant follicle seen till day 13, which means that you are having an anovulatory cycle.That is , no mature egg is developing for ovulation this month.Anovulatory cycles are a major cause for not being able to conceive.PCOD ( Polycystic ovarian disease ) is one of the leading causes of anovulation, apart from other conditions.You need to consult a gynecologist, and undergo further investigations for PCOD to rule out the cause of this follicular study.Also, you might require treatment and ovulation induction ( medicines to stimulate formation of follicles in the ovary ).In case your cycles are delayed ( longer than 28 - 30 days ), there is a minor possibility that your follicles are maturing later than normal, for eg, in a 35 day cycle, the day of ovulation would be 14 days before periods, that is on day 20 or 21.

Please help.","Doctor":"Hello, I appreciate your query. Based on your history, it appears that you have not had your period for the past three months, apart from the slight discharge once. Did you have regular monthly menstrual cycles earlier ? If that is so, then pregnancy is a very likely possibility. You have had equivocal Urine Pregnancy Tests so far, hence please do not perform any more. You should visit a gynaecologist at the earliest, for an examination and an ultrasound, which will confirm your pregnancy. It is possible that it is early pregnancy, or an ectopic pregnancy ( pregnancy outside the uterus ).. however nothing short of an ultrasound will tell you for sure. Also, you are definitely overweight, which also might be interfering with your menstrual patterns, in case you are not pregnant, you should definitely try to exercise, eat healthily and lose more weight. If pregnancy is not possible, please rule out other conditions like PCOD ( polycystic ovarian disease ), hypothyroidism etc, which cause such abnormalities of periods. Everything should be taken care of once you visit a gynaecologist for further treatment.

If your monthly cycles/ periods are regular, I would suggest that you have intercourse around your fertile period or ovulation period. The chances of conceiving are high during this period. Don't be anxious. Try for another 3- 4 months.If you still don't get pregnant after this time, do consult a gynaecologist. Do write to me, regarding your monthly periods, no. of days you have your periods, when was your last menstrual period (date of last periods) . Are your menstrual cycles regular? After an interval of how many days do you get your next period? Once I have the details, I will be in a better position to advise you on your fertile / ovulatory period. In the meantime, eat healthy ; plenty of fresh fruits and vegetables. Drink atleast 8-10 glasses of water a day. Do regular Yoga/ Meditation. Pyricontin is a part of Vitamin B complex. It is good for your general health. Hope this helps. Have a great day. Regards, Dr. Divya Kuttikrishnan."},{"Patient":"It has been 6 days sense i have had unprotected sex in hopes to become pregnant. i know this sounds crazy but i have been feeling pregnant sense that very night. and the last few days been experience bubbly gurgling alot in my stomach more than normal. i know my body and know i dont alwayd hear and feel this. and as of today at this very moment i just started getting a headache . does this sound like pregnancy? i feel like there is something going on in there would gurgling and bubbly feelings be a part of all that happens when ur body is trying to become or is pregnant?","Doctor":"hi there, you seem to be very anxious to get pregnant, which you should not be. Within 6 days its highly unlikely for the body to respond that way if you are pregnant. These could be just autosuggestion by your mind which is making you feel like that. Headache can be incedental. Anyways you can wait for three days after your missed period and confirm your pregnancy with a card test. It is as simple. In the meanwhile you can calm down and take healthy diet and lots of rest which will take care of your gurgling stomach and headache. Let nature take its course.

Menstrual irregularities like inter menstrual spotting, change in the length of the cycle etc. can occur due to many causes. Though some of your symptoms can be seen in pregnancy just by that pregnancy cannot be confirmed. So you once go for blood test for pregnancy which will rule out the possibility.

When follicles reach a size more than 17 to 18 mm, take injection for rupturing the follicles.  Be in contact with your husband for 2 to 3 days after injection.  Take progesterone for next 2 weeks.  Do a urine pregnancy test at home after that.  You can try like that for 3 to 6 cycles. If it doesn't work, then you can go for a IUI. Do a HSG test to see the tubal patency before that."},{"Patient":"thanks for your answer i again took cerophene during menses and HMG treatment and this time follicle size was 1.4 but i later i found that i am pregnant. unfortunately miscarrage occur after 2.5 month and now i feel weakness. i think i should wait now for 3 to 4 months than i will try again and would go for medican.

If you had the spotting on the days corresponding to your cycle, it could also be some hormonal imbalance. You can repeat the pregnancy test and ask for the report of the sonogram.

There are various possible reasons like tubal block, anovulatory cycles secondary to post delivery weight gain and subsequent hormonal imbalance, pelvic inflammation, male factor and so on. If everything is fine, then you have to wait for a few months with continuation of treatment.

My doctor said that when it s at it s lowest is when you are ovulating and then it increases right after that. While my temp was at it s lowest and I thought I could be ovulating I also did a few ovulation predictor tests each day and they all said negative so now I m not sure what to think.

I have tried ovulation predictors before and they have never read positive but why would my temp drop like it did earlier this month (and I wasn t sick or anything)?","Doctor":"Hello. Thanks for writing to us. The ovulation predictor kits are a more accurate to identify the time of ovulation rather than a basal body temperature method. The BBT depends on the progesterone levels of the body while LH surge kit detects the high level of LH in urine. I hope this information has been both informative and helpful for you.

If you are hyperthyroid it is most likely that you will be underweight. You are definitely overweight and this itself could induce infertility by disturbing ovulation. You should try to reduce weight so that your BMI gets within normal limits of 19-25. Exercise and diet should be combined with a sincere effort. Also, try to get a complete checkup including hormonal assay, tubal patency, follicular study and sonogram; and semen analysis of your husband. If all the reports are normal you can go for natural methods. Please get further instructions from your doctor.

Since ovulation usually occurs around 14th-16thday in such cycles, fertile period when intercourse can result in a pregnancy ranges from 11th-18th day.

Better to take folic acid from one month before the pregnancy. Usually 400 to 800 micrograms of folic acid is needed during pregnancy. But as you had previous history of microcephaly (possibly), you have to take 4000 micrograms of folic acid per day. This high dose can prevent birth defects in the baby.

The fact is that fertility is higher in younger age groups as compared to older age couples due to dwindling hormones as age advances.

It can be that you are pregnant. Montgomery's tubercles are one of the earliest pregnancy symptoms before missed period.  They appear as tiny bumps on the areola sometimes dark colored or small whiteheads. Not only do the breasts become very sore,  but the nipples also hurt a lot. The Montgomery tubercles can start as early as within 3 – 6 weeks of pregnancy. However sometimes Montgomery’s tubercles can appear even when you are not pregnant. They can occur due to hormonal imbalances like raised prolactin hormone as well when you are stressed or are under going physical changes. So you should consider a pregnancy test instead of relying completely on pregnancy symptoms before missed period. take care."},{"Patient":"Hi, I m trying to conceive but unable to.

Reading your history, I presume you are a case of Polycystic ovarian syndrome(PCOS). The treatment you are taking is perfect for conceiving in PCOS. The only thing is that you have to take the treatment consistently and as advised by your doctor. Also keep patience as good results are seen only after few months. Metmel is metformin which is main drug to normalize the hormonal imbalance in PCOS. Ubiphene is clomiphene which is used to stimulate the ovaries to produce eggs. This function of ovary is altered in PCOS. These two are the main drugs treating your inability to conceive. The other drugs oosure(anti oxidant) , ovacare(multiviatmin) and duphaston (progesterone tablet)would help ensure safe pregnancy.

You wait till 2 weeks after intercourse and if you do not get periods by that time go for a blood test or  urine test for pregnancy. Take care."},{"Patient":"I am 22 years old I have been trying to get pregnant for the past 6 months, this month has been very strange for me, alot of strange thing that usually dont happen have been. but the strangest thing started today I started getting bad cramps so I thought I was just going to get my period like every other month, but instead i started spotting a light pink, then later in the day it started to get more watery and like an orange color, I have yet to get any dark red blood , Could I possibly be pregnant? I just dont want to get my hopes up again.","Doctor":"Hi, Thanks for the query. These symptoms can be seen in early pregnancy but can also be seen in premenstrual period. So just because of symptoms we cannot confirm or rule out the pregnancy. So you wait till your expected date of periods. If you do not usual blood flow by that time go for either blood or urine test for pregnancy which will find out the possibility.

There are a number of variables that can influence a couple's chances of conceiving in any given month. If both you and your husband are fertile and in good health, there's a 15 to 25% chance of getting pregnant in each ovulatory cycle. If you look at things from a strictly statistical point of view, roughly 40% of couples conceive within the first three months of trying (which means having frequent, unprotected sex during the four or five days surrounding your ovulation date). 75% of couples will have conceived during the first six months of trying, and 85 to 90% of couples will have conceived within one year. Couples who cannot conceive within one year should consider a fertility workup. (Many couples seek help at six to nine months, though, which is fine if you're getting anxious about your failure to conceive.) Having sex every day does not decrease your chances of getting pregnant. I hope that helps, and good luck!"},{"Patient":"Hi, I am trying to conceive, I stopped my pill the end of september and my period was due yesterday. My periods have not come, I have done a pregnancy test which is negative. Last time I came off my pill to conceive I had no problems and had my next period as normal. I am really worried as how am I suppose to plan conceiving if I am not having periods.","Doctor":"HELLO THERE. THANKS FOR WRITING. PAST USE OF ORAL CONTRACEPTIVE PILLS DOES NOT AFFECT FERTILITY. IT DOES NOT DELAY CONCEPTION. THE DELAY IN PERIODS COULD BE DUE TO SLIGHT HORMONAL IMBALANCE WHICH CAN BE DUE TO OTHER ASSOCIATED REASONS LIKE STRESS, ANXIETY, CHANGE IN ENVIRONMENT AND WEIGHT GAIN. THE FIRST PERIOD AFTER STOPPING THE PILL CAN BE AFFECTED IN TERMS OF ONSET. BUT YOU NEED NOT WORRY BECAUSE OF THIS REGARDING YOUR SUBSEQUENT PERIODS AND ABILITY TO CONCEIVE. PILL USE DOES NOT AFFECT YOUR ABILITY TO CONCEIVE IN ANY WAY ONCE THEY ARE STOPPED.

Pleas do a UPT (urine pregnancy test) which u can do it at home by urself. If its positive, then the spotting (brown discharge) which ur getting is because of the implantation of the placenta in the uterus, which means there's further development of the fetus is happening in the womb. This has to be a good news for you:-) If pregnancy is negative, the tablets do have these side effects because of the hormones in them. Kindly do not panic. thank you:-)"},{"Patient":"i need to know whether i may be pregnant or just have a stomach bug. see, my husband and i had unprotected sex only 4 days ago. i wasn t at all great, in fact it only lasted 2 minutes. anway, like a day or so later, i felt more happy and alive than i ve ever felt in my life. i just felt so calm and at peace. weird. then yesterday, i had a slight problem of keeping everything in. i can keep it all down just not in. i also felt realy tired during the middle of my shift at work. oh and on the secon day i had nasty leg pain. and now today, i have a big problem keeping everything in and i woke up with a mild sore throat and a headache . i called in from work because i don t want to go to the bathroom every 5 minutes. i know pregnancy doesn t typically happen overnight and that they typically don t show flu-like symptoms but i ve read that they can and i know that not everyone is the same and no two pregnancies are alike. and i d rather have this diarrhea than be throwing up every 5 minutes. still, what do you think? bug or pregnancy? also need to know when i should test because i have irregular periods and my last one was right at the end of september, if that helps.","Doctor":"Hello, Early pregnancy can show symptoms like tiredness, sleepiness, headaches, nausea and excessive urination and a raised temperature. You are perhaps having an infection. If your periods are irregular and not in the 28-35 day zone, then it is difficult to predict your ovulation time. You can nevertheless test with a HPT and with the result, you may consult a gynecologist for further management.

Treatment for hirsuitism won't allow you to get pregnant & vice versa. First decide your priority & accordingly get treated. Though Krimson might reduce hirsuitism after 3-6 months of continuous treatment, it acts as contraceptive & pregnancy will not be possible. If hirsuitism is your main concern & you don't want pregnancy right now, you can take the prescribed medicines. If pregnancy is your first priority, its better to consult infertility specialist & get treated (& stop Krimson).

Since my 2nd day of period they have started Fertab for me as well for 5 days and asked me to come on 20th day for pelvic ultrasound. Please suggest me whether i ll concieve or not?","Doctor":"Hello and welcome to HCM First of all you need to understand the basics of Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome (PCOS). Normally in amonthly ovarian cycle, there is formation of multiple follicles in the ovary. One of these follicles mature in one cycle. This mature follicle releases one ovum. This ovum meets the sperm and zygote is formed and thus fertilization takes place. In PCOS, the formation of follicles in the ovary is normal but maturation is defective. None of the follicles mature and there is no release of ovum from the ovary. Treatment is aimed at increasing the cahnces of maturation of ovuma nd release of more number of ovum per cycle. Fertab is Clomiphene citrate which increases the rate of ovulation. Glucphage is metformin which increases the action of insulin in body which has become defecient over a period of time. Your doctor has prescribed you the right drugs but a point to note is that the sperm count in your husband is low (15 million/ml). Normally, it should be atleast 20 million/ ml. Please confirm this finding and repeat the sperm counts.

Miscarriage in early weeks of pregnancy can happen due to many causes and progesterone deficiency is one of them.

Steroids go off the system fairly quickly (less than a week), and in any case you - the woman - have not been on any of these medications. Imuran takes much longer to get off the system, but this should not be stopped as it is a great medication to keep the Ulcerative colitis under control, and should not give any problems in terms of achieving pregnancy.

You are suffering from Secondary Amenorrhoea for last 6 months.Also you are trying to conceive and you got last period 6m ago after taking MPA.

After all investigations,consult with your doctor and you will be treated accordingly.

As age goes by, the number of follicles in the ovaries decrease and so ovarian stimulation results in little or sometimes no response-this is sometimes called oopause. FSH levels may be high due to this and you will need more medication for ovarian stimulation. Please consult your doctor for further opinion. Take care."},{"Patient":"My both overies shows multiple tiny follicles.Right overy measures 3.8*2m.1cms.Left overy measures 3.5*2.5cms.Impression is bilateral olycystic ovaries.

Usually poly cystic ovaries will cause problems like irregular menstruation, anovulation, insulin resistance etc. But as you are having regular cycles probably you are ovulating regularly. The medicines give by your doctor mainly contains vitamins and supplements which will help in increasing general strength and fertilizing capacity. As you are ovulating normally may be because of that your doctor didn't keep any ovulation induction drugs. Ideally your weight should be around 60kgs. So by decreasing some amount of weight and planning intercourse around the time of ovulation you can increase the chances of conception.

Is this true or should I start anyway??? plz answer me quickly","Doctor":"Hello, Any infection can lead to a rise in the white blood cell count and this could affect the sperm count but the concept is yet to be confirmed as this is still undergoing studies. Any rise in the body temperature can also decrease sperm count as the local temperature of the scrotum goes up. So, in view of this, I suggest that you discuss the matter with your doctor before you go for IVF in this cycle. You may be able to proceed if the sperm count and activity is normal.

I am not on my fourth pack of the birth control pills. I skipped my period two months in a row on purpose- continuing on with a new pack instead of the placebo pills. It was a stressful time for me and I wasnt sexual active at the time. So after finishing the third pack, I continued it out. During the third pack, I had a boyfriend for a little while, we were sexual active and practiced safe sex . Now I am over a week late on my period, almost two, I took a pregnancy test and it came negative. I havent gained any weight or had any early pregnancy symtoms.

I then had unprotected sex with Guy A from the end of June, to early July (my typical fertile period). I took 3 pregnancy tests that all said negative right before my July period. I then got my July period July 17-20th. It seemed heavy/crampy but I ve had that in the past. Then I had sex with Guy B on July 20-22nd on the tail end of my period. A few days later, July 26-28th, I had another period type of bleeding . It seemed like a light period, then my breasts became quite sore, and I had sharp pains in the lower right abdomen . All of these symptoms ended abruptly July 29th. July 29th I had an immediate, bright blue positive home pregnancy test . I confirmed at the doctor s on July 30th -- they took my BLOOD hcg and it was 206, but my progesterone was 7.5 (seemed low?). All they said was it seemed like an early pregnancy, no other questions answered and said they want to re-check my blood hcg a week from that point. When did I likely conceive?? Was the 2nd period from July 26-28 implantation? Do the hcg levels add up to that?? I was told by someone else that if my hormone levels remain low, it was likely guy A and I m having an abnormal pregnancy. But if the 2nd hcg re-check is high/normal, then it was likely guy B. Does this sound right?","Doctor":"Hi. Thank you for putting up your problem to Healthcare Magic! You are very strange in you choice. You should have had some protection if you did not want to get pregnant and at least this should have practised with the guy who was not supposed to father the child. Getting pregnant deliberately and then worring/abortion are not safe. Changing partners so casually can lead to serious STDs. If it is guy A then hCG levels must have been be low and chances of blighted ovum/ectopic pregnancy are high and it is very risky so get an Trans-vaginal Ultrasound to rule out any risk. If it is guy B then the levels of hCG should be raising to doubles almost other day for normal pregnancy. If the levels are not appropriate then you will need the Trans-vaginal Ultrasound to rule out the risk. You need to start the treatment after consulting your gynecologist.

Iron may be started in the second trimester. However, if you are anemic, it can be started even before you conceive.

Glycomet (metformin) is indeed used for treatment of PCOD. As per your height you are overweight. A natural pregnancy indicates that you are ovulating. You did not mention your menstrual history. Abortion after 2 months without fetal heart beat indicates abnormal fetal development or a missed abortion which could be due to insufficient progesterone level that is characteristic of PCOD.

My collegue who had been through the same thing suggested that I try ova far 2.5 mg... She tried it once and she conceived.. I m expecting my period on 6th of August... I asked my gynac but she seems clueless about ovafar ... Thank you","Doctor":"Hello. Thanks for writing to us, Ovafar (clomiphene) is the drug of first choice for inducing ovulation i.e growing eggs. It is cheap, effective, easily available and well tolerated. It is also used for superovulating normal women to help them grow more eggs. Clomiphene is an antiestrogen and it acts by \\"fooling \\" the pituitary into believing that estrogen levels in the body are low as a result of which the pituitary starts producing more FSH and LH - the gonadotropin hormones which in turn leads to stimulation of the ovaries. Only women who produce estrogen will respond to clomiphene. The starting dose is one tablet (50 mg) a day for five consecutive days. The first tablet can be taken on day 2, 3, 4 or 5 of the cycle - this is usually decided by your doctor and depends on the length of your menstrual cycle. It is not enough to just take clomiphene but is equally important to monitor the response as well. Hence will recommend you consult your clinician and avoid any self medications with right dosage. I hope this information has been both informative and helpful for you. Thanks"},{"Patient":"Hie doctor, My husband n me had relation during my fertile days n we are planning for baby.My doc had suggested to take tab zentel & tab azithral course for a day to remove worms & infection any on 20 day frm the first day of my last menses.I was just worried as to will this not hinder in this process if conception n implantation occurs.Plz reply","Doctor":"Hi, Welcome to HCM, Thanks for trusting Healthcaremagic and posting your query. In my opinion there is no justification behind taking Zentel and Azithral tablets on 20th day of menstrual period. For any infection and infestation these should be given prior to ovulation. Azithral and Zentel comes under pregnancy category (US FDA) B and C, thus should be avoided after conception. Hope you found my response to your query informative and helpful.

Some bleeding or  spotting can occur during early weeks of pregnancy. So you could still be pregnant and this could be not your usual period but pregnancy associated bleeding.This happens when the embryo gets implanted in the uterus , hence also called implantation bleeding. Other causes could be an ectopic pregnancy, an early miscarriage ,placental abnormalities or a menstrual cycle delayed due to stress & hormonal imbalances. The first thing you should do is get a urine pregnancy test and if positive an ultrasound and blood beta hcg levels. This can confirm your pregnancy and the cause of the bleeding. Alternatively you may consult your gynaecologist if the pregnancy test is negative to evaluate for any hormonal problems. Hope that answers your query. Regards"},{"Patient":"Hi, Am 33 years old.

I am sorry that you are experiencing difficulty in conceiving. You stated that you had a number  of tests done that were negative. In cases of infertility it is important that rule out hormonal or structural reasons that can contribute. The most common cause of infertility particularly in women with excess weight is Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome. This is diagnosed if a women has irregular periods ( periods do not come for a long time), signs of excess male hormones such as acne or hair growth in male areas ( face, chest, abdomen) or cysts ( sacs) on ovaries. Blood tests are done to rule out other conditions and to check for elevation of certain hormones. An ultrasound is also done to check the ovaries. It is usually treated with weight loss which actually induces ovulation and metformin a diabetic drug which reduces insulin resistance and may actually assist in ovulation. Additionally in women like yourself who are trying to conceive fertomid can be used. This medication increases hormones that support the growth and secretion of a mature egg. It is normally started at 50 mg a day for 5 days starting on day 3, 4 or 5 of period. Day 1 of your period is the first day of bleeding so day 3, would be the third day of bleeding, day 4,the 4th day and so on; this is when the meds would generally be started. You should take them at the prescribed dose and only take an increased amount if directed to do  so by your doctor. Your doctor may consider increasing the dosage if the lower dose is not effective."},{"Patient":"My sister has undergone an abortion 2 years back.Doctors could not find why she underwent an abortion.After that she gave a gap of one year to strenghten her uterus and started trying to get conceived.Last week when she underwent diagnosis ,it was found that she has TB in uterus.She is 26 years old and height is 5.4 and weight is 68kgs.Doctors said that she should be under treatment for 6 months to get rid og TB.What are the chances for her pregnancy ????

(Progesterone and Estrogen are both female hormones. Estrogens are dominantly secreted before ovulation and Progesterone are secreted after ovulation.).  Duphaston usually supports pregnancy and is given in pregnant women if there is any threat of abortion (such as if the patient has had bleeding in the first trimester). It is also given in case of irregular periods as a progesterone challenge. If everything else is fine, most the times, periods normalize and ovulation occurs. That being said, there are several ways how Duphaston is conducive to pregnancy occurrence and continuation and there could be several reasons why you have been advised the medicine. We would need more details around your gynecological, obstetrical and medical history and history of present complaints to advise further. Hence, it may be best for you to confirm the days with your infertility specialist. Additional information: Fertomid and Clomid are trade names for clomiphene which is a drug used for fertility treatment. It induces ovulation.

Now periods are still irregular. Now Doctor advice me to take progyluton with metformin and to reduce my weight. My question : How much the chances to regulate my periods with this treatment and is it possible for me to get PREGNANT?? We are eagerly trying and praying hard for a child. Please Doctor whom Online, do advice me what shall I do??? Thank you.","Doctor":"Dear Malini, Weight loss and metformin is the best treatment to regulate cycles and resume ovulation and is successful in 50 to 70% cases. But ovulation does not guarantee pregnancy. You must loose about 25 to 30 kg weight for this. If ovulation induction with clomid and IUI has not been successful then chances of pregnancy are best with ART and IVF. It is possible for you to get pregnant by ART and IVF. Obesity causes a lot of complications in pregnancy so you must try to loose weight."},{"Patient":"Hai Dr,i was married on last may 8th2011.And for the first 4 months we were in family planning .But now we are struggling to get pregnant.My periods are regular.through USG ovulation has also occured.ON MAY 2012 i did HSG also and it was normal.My hus count is also good and we both dont have any endocrinal abnormalities.Now iam hoping to get pregnant this month also.Doctor what may be the possible cause of not getting pregnant.This month(july) i took 3 doses of Inj.Foliculin.I beg u to answer for my questions please","Doctor":"Hi, Welcome to HealthcareMagic forum. If all tests including your partner semen analysis are normal; your periods are regular then I do not see any problems in conceiving.

If you have done that, I would suggest you have a fair chance to get pregnant this time around. Hope this helps.

Since you have had a right ovarian cyst for a year you need to repeat an ultrasound of the pelvis to see if the cyst is still there or disappeared.

Another possible cause of irregular periods -- being overweight, or underweight, can cause a disruption in your menstrual cycles. Both being overweight, and underweight, can also cause anovulation. Extreme exercise and extreme dieting are more potential causes of irregular cycles. In this case, losing weight may be enough to regulate your cycles again, increasing the chances of getting pregnant naturally. If extreme dieting is the problem, changing your diet to a more balanced plan, and even gaining some weight if you're underweight, can help regulate your cycles. bbyeee"},{"Patient":"hi!I am 27yrs married woman.. i have my periods every 29-30 days...a day before my periods i get a brownish discharge & the next day my period starts but its scanty..but painful( ive always had painful periods),d flow is red bt scanty..it lasts for 2 days & then from the 3rd day i might have a red spot or not..this lasts for 5 days...what is the reason for this?my thyroid tests are normal..I ve been trying to conceive for the past 2 years..","Doctor":"Hi sadiqa786, your periods are not heavy and the flow you have described may be normal. The pains that you experience could be due to varied reasons most commonly may be due to polycystic ovary disease, pelvic inflammatory disease, endometriosis or no explained cause. As you are also trying to concieve it would be best to visit a gynecologist and get yourself evaluated for the same and during the course of investigation they will be able to find any cause for dysmenhorria(pain ful periods) if any. In the meanwhile you could start doing some exercise or yoga to keep yourself fit and to lose weight if you are overweight. Yoga helps in releiving cramps and helps in decreasing pain during periods.

However it is too early to predict whether or not you are pregnant. Presuming you and your partner do not have any associated condition which impairs chances of conception, I would say that you have plenty of chances of becoming pregnant. Yet, you need to wait till your expected date of period. Get the urine pregnancy test if your periods do not happen on time. In addition to this, I also recommend you to take 5mg folic acid pills. One tablet a day is to be taken each day. And stay relaxed.

If we assume that ovulation occurred on about cycle day #14, AND that you concieved, then a pregnancy test should be positive at this time.  Given that the tests are negative, it sounds like you are NOT pregnant.  It is likely that your symptoms are related to your cycle.  It can be confusing when you are \\"late\\" and with negative tests, but here is what I would recommend: 1.  Repeat the test in one week, regardless of your cycle 2.  If you don't get your period in one week, it is likely because you had delayed ovulation or did not actually ovulate.  In this case, you might need medication to start a period, such as progesterone. 3.  If things remain confusing, your doctor could check a blood pregnancy test and/or a progesterone level to see if that clarifies what is going on. I hope this helps.

Moreover ovulation time matters most for pregnancy. If you have not vaginal sex and you know that the period was post ovulating then there is nothing to worry.* But if you still have any doubt in mind then you can go for a blood test named beta hcg in a nearby reputed laboratory to confirm about pregnancy. This test will tell you about the pregnancy.* I hope you are satisfied with my answer.

Clomid is a synthetic chemical whose chemical name is Clomiphene citrate. It is not a fertility drug per se, but it is given only to induce ovulation by fooling your body into believing that there is less estrogen. This leads to an increased production of a hormone called GnRH, causing the pituitary to pump out more of another hormone called FSH and LH, thus inducing ovulation. Clomid is usually given for 5 days, starting on cycle days 3-5, and most women will usually ovulate 5-9 days after the last dose of Clomid. Tvs is transvaginal sonography of Follicular dynamics. The  first thing the doctor will see is the number of follicles that are developing. In a typical cycle, without the aid of infertility medications, one follicle ripens and one egg is released. With infertility medications, particularly injections, more follicles will develop. Near the beginning of the cycle, this information will be used to make adjustments in the dosage of your medications. If the follicles aren't developing enough, the dosage may be increased. If there are too many follicles, the doctor may reduce your medications. In some cases, particularly with IUI, the doctor may cancel a cycle with too many follicles, due to the increased risk of a higher order multiple pregnancy. The size of the follicles will also be examined. This gives insight into how many follicles are developing into mature eggs. In addition, this information will be used to schedule egg retrieval procedures or to administer the HCg injection to stimulate the ovaries to release the eggs.

The medicine prescribed for your husband may help but its not worth the wait. Even with IVF treatment sometimes there is a wait period that couples have to go through.

Progyluton has been given to you to regularize your cycles. Once the cycles become regular, ovulation-inducing drugs like clomid are given along with serial ovulation studies to find out the effect of these drugs on your ovaries. Intercourse is then advised when mature follicles are formed.I hope this information has been both informative and helpful for you.

Since you appear not to have any problem with your reproductive system as of now, your husband's sperm appears a bit weak. Normally more than 30% live with motility and 25% should have progressive motility. He needs to eat plenty of fresh fruits and green leafy vegetables, stop smoking and drinking alcohol. Also taking tablet Paternia once a day will help. There may be some hormonal disturbance which is the reason you will be on hCG treatment. This will bring back required reproductive hormones for pregnancy to occur. Clomid will increase chances of fertilization and pregnancy as well.

To check your ovulation status you may under go ultrasound follicle tracking or certain blood tests like serum progesterone in second half of your cycle. To check your pregnancy status you may undergo pregnancy test once you are late for your periods.

Will there be any problems.","Doctor":"Hello and welcome the healthcare magic. Fertility issues can be male or female related. Infertility is defined as the failure to conceive after one year of unprotected sexual intercourse and occurs in 10 to 15 % of couples in the reproductive age groups. In terms of female issues, once the woman has normal regular periods with no known gynaecologial problems then there should be no problem getting pregnant:  pregnancy occurs when then egg is released from the ovary , travels along the fallopian tube to implant in the womb or uterus, meets sperm to form the fetus and the fetus stays in the womb till it is viable. Anything that affects this, from the release of the egg to the meeting of the sperm would affect the possibiltity of pregnancy. Male and female factors each account for about 35% of fertility issues. Female factors can be divided into cervical ( like blockage of the cervix or problems with the interaction between the sperm and the cervical mucus), uterurs problems, problems with ovary, tubes. Stress is also thought to impact on pregnancy. Male factors can be divided into (1) pretesticular ( before reaching the testes) : anything affecting the areas that send messages to the testes about the release of testosterone, (2) testicular - anything that causes the testes not to work properly or (3) post testicular which is related to the transport of the sperm All these facts aside if you are both relatively well with no known severe illness then you should have no problem conceiving, congrats in advance."},{"Patient":"Hi, I was given a shot of Ovidrel injection last April 21, Saturday.

Thanks P.s. is it ok to have sex days after the egg has ruptured? How do I know when the egg has already ruptured?","Doctor":"Hello, Welcome to HCM, Ideally you should have had sex 36 hours after shot of Ovidrel injection. As sperms survive more many days in uterus, chances of contraception are present, but few. You can predict ovulation by use of Ovulation Prediction Kit. After ovulation when egg is coming towards uterus through oviduct, it is fertilized by a sperm.

You can increase your chances of becoming pregnant each month by having sex at least every 3 days before and during ovulation. It is especially important to do so 72 hours before ovulation begins. Ovulation occurs about 2 weeks before the next menstrual cycle (period) starts.

Ideally Loette pills should start on day 1 of a woman's natural menstrual cycle ( i.e. the 1st day of menstrual bleeding). Starting on days 2-7 of the menstrual cycle (eg, Sunday start) is allowed,  however, a non-hormonal back-up method of birth control (eg, condoms, spermicide) is recommended during the first 7 days of Loette use. After that you may resume unprotected sex without facing extra risk.

Also, most generic over the counter \\"prenatal vitamins\\" contain 800mcg of folate.  This would be adequate for anyone trying to get pregnant.  From my experience, the only advantage of one pill over another is potentially the SIZE of the pill.  Often prenatals are large pills, but some of the more expensive name brands are smaller.

N.B a) semen analysis is good with no abnormal forms or motlity b) patent lt tube by hysterosalpigogram c) history of endometriosis discovered during laparoscopic salpingectomy. d) good hormonal profile FSH, LH, TSH, prolactin, anti-phospholipid tests 1- now i am planning of re do but i still have 12 frozen blastocysts , but i need your advise bec we thawed the 3rd day embryos from the first ivf , then let them grow till the blastocyst stage , then did the transfer the last time , then refreezed them again. will that work bec i will do FET the next month or i have to do a new fresh cycle? 2- and i want to know such failures related to the clinic , technique, non expert doctor , regimens i used or quality of embryos although they told us that they are good one? 3- what are your recommendations for next cycle? plz i really need your advice because i am very frustrated and breakhearted","Doctor":"1.  Proceeding with frozen embryo transfer is the next best option since that is what is available 2.  Failures are due to the fact that IVF success rate is not 100%, at all.  Quality of the clinic is somewhat of a factor but success rates are published and available. Failure is due to maternal age, poor embryo quality, and implantation failure. 3.  Recommendations are to use all frozen embryos and then repeat a fresh cycle.  AFter 3 ivf cycles, success is less likely."},{"Patient":"Please, my question or worry is: I took a capsule of ampiclox during a late dinner--about 21:30 hours--whereas my ovulation began the next morning. At 05:30, I had sex with my partner targetting conception as he reached ejaculation; and yet a couple rounds of sex within the next 18 hours.Is conceiving in peril on my part?","Doctor":"Hi, Thanks for discussing your concerns with us. Actually this period of ovulation & fertilization is very sensitive. At this stage if an insult occurs to an embryo it usually gets aborted sometimes without coming into our knowledge i.e. without a clinical pregnancy. If the insult is below a critical threshold it may not effect the fertilized egg at all. That is an \\"all or none law\\" is applicable at this stage. Simply speaking if pregnancy occurs this means the insult was below the critical level & has not effected your pregnancy. If God forbid it has affected your egg at this early stage it will be lost without you being aware. I hope I made my point clear. Best of luck."},{"Patient":"hi i was diagnosed with uterine fibroid and ovarian cysts last sep then my doc gave me danogen for three months ,my symptoms was severe pain in the left side of stomach just 5th day of mentrual cycle later pain ll subside after 4 or 5 days flowed by brown coloured watery discharge . now my course for danogen is over and later m supposed to tk ovigyn and levotol can u plz guide me regarding this . m planning for baby also this year .","Doctor":"Danazol is jst completed by you and you conceiving may take few days after you complete the course of ovigyn and levotol.

Clofert is used for inducing ovulation in women who have irregular or no ovulation. I hope your doctor has tested your ovulation status & has found some problem to justify this line of management. In women with normal ovulation & no history of fertility problems there is no indication for clofert (rather it should be avoided) as it is not without risks. Some doctors prescribe Duphaston for supporting any anticipated pregnancy (hormonal support) . I think you should discuss with your doctor about the indications of last two medicines as she or he knows the most about you.

There could be many reasons for delayed periods other than pregnancy, like stress, anxiety, hormonal imbalance, illness etc. Regarding your symptoms of heavy flow followed by brown discharge this can occur in times of stress or if you are anemic or ill.

If your period is delayed by more than a week then you can get tested using a home pregnancy kit. In case your pregnancy test is positive and you choose to go for an abortion, please consult your gynecologist who will guide you.

If your periods are regular, you should already have had your next period by 28th of April. Since that did not happen, your ovulation could have been delayed, in which case you could be possibly pregnant. There is no way of being sure that you are not pregnant until you have your next period. Meanwhile you could get your serum / urine pregnancy test done to confirm pregnancy, though Negative result does not exclude pregnancy, it only means that pregnancy is not of minimum duration which is required for the test to become positive.

Either trouble in the pregnancy or implantation bleeding which is usually a good sign. Implantation bleeding is typically defined as bleeding that occurs 10 to 14 days after conception, when the fertilized egg attaches to the lining of the uterus. Although the phenomenon of implantation bleeding hasn't been scientifically proven to exist, bleeding at this point in pregnancy is relatively common and perfectly normal. Implantation bleeding is thought to result from blood leaking from the implanted egg into the uterine cavity. It occurs earlier than a menstrual period. Implantation bleeding may last for one to two days with a flow similar to a menstrual period. Implantation bleeding that's heavier than a normal period is rare. You need to get an ultrasound to confirm if the egg has implanted to the uterus. This is the only way you can allay your dears at this time. Speak to your Obstetrician regarding this and take his/her advise."},{"Patient":"I am an x-ray tech and i am also trying to conceive? will being an x-ray tech lessen my chances of conceiving? or are there any tips or advice you can offer me? thank you","Doctor":"hello...well since you r a xray technician...your radiologist can guide u properly abt the things.

I masturbated at home and cleaned with tissue, about three hours later my gf arrived and we had penetrative sex without a condom at the beginning then i put one on. any help is greatly appreciated thanks,","Doctor":"Hello sir and thank you for posting your query here.... I will definitely help you out.. Welcome to HCM.. I being a surgeon, we encounter so many such cases such cases day in and day out.. I read your question completely and have understood it well.. I will analyze all your points.. And provide the possible explanations.. 1. Masturbated 3 hours before sex will definitely reduce the chance of pregnancy but does not rule it out. Yes, post ejaculation it is advised that it takes about 24 hours for normal sperm concentration in semen. So there are definitely, less chances of pregnancy.. 2. You say, you had sex without condom initially and then you put on one.. Well, again, the main question is did you ejaculate inside of the vagina or no, becomes important. Two scenarios arise here.. A. In case you haven't ejaculated, then I can say with certainty that there's no chance of pregnancy. B. In case you are sure that you ejaculated inside of vagina then, there is a reduction in chance of pregnancy taking into consideration the 3 hour before masturbation. 3. We have to wait.. And hope that she's not pregnant.. And you didn't have post coital tablets, so chances are there.. Hope this helps you, in case you need any further assistance, please let me know.. Take care and God bless.."},{"Patient":"how can i check that i m pregnent or not from my boyfriend without going any clinic & medical??","Doctor":"Hi Welcome to Healthcare Magic Forum u will get urine pregnancy kit in medical store, u can buy and test urself from ur urine, instructions will be given in kit.

There are chances of pregnancy.But unlikely.You should wait till you miss your next period and get tested with home pregnancy kit after a week.This way the results would be accurate. I would sincerely advise you not to be very anxious about pregnancy.The decision of when it happens should be left to nature as the chances of a woman getting pregnant with all ideal conditions is about 30 %. It is a natural process . You should also wait till you get one or two cycle regularly and then try for pregnancy.Giving a gap between previous abortion and next conception ensures a healthier pregnancy now.

Your question is not clear. I presume you mean seminal fluid touched your sex organ. You have not mentioned the date of your last period. If it was in the first week of your period or a week before you were expecting your period, then it is unlikely that you could get pregnant, which is called safe period. Even in unsafe period if the seminal fluid did not enter the vagina, then you are not likely to get pregnant. If the fluid entered your vagina possibility of becoming pregnant is always there. In such case if you miss your next period then you will need to do pregnancy test with urine, to find out if you are pregnant.

All those medications are the routine regimen followed by obstetricians. How effective they are, is debatable. Pregnancy is a natural process and the best thing that we can do is, not to interfere with that process. Avoid over exertion, bumpy travel, heavy work etc. Be relaxed, watch T.V. and enjoy the current situation rather than worrying your head off over imaginary calamities. Adopt POSITIVE ATTITUDE and have confidence in yourself that every thing is going to be just fine.Previous abortion was due to incompatibility of the child to survive and no amount of treatment would have prevented it.Wishing you a very healthy and chubby child."},{"Patient":"I am 26/f with hypothyroidism . I take 137 mcg of livothroid daily. I had a miscarriage in June 2011. After 2 cycles of mensuration I am trying to conceive now. I was testing my ovulation and it showed that I ovulated on September 21 and 22. The dates are completely different from what the ovulation prediction calendars have shown with my cycle length of 37. I ovulated almost 5 days later that what the ovulation predictors have said. I am concerned if I have PCOS because of my period cycles. I am overweight but I dont have any high blood pressure or diabetes. After my first miscarriage I started having hair on my stomach, chin, upper lip. My question is should I be really concerned about PCOS? What can be done to make sure that I dont have PCOS?","Doctor":"Welcome to Healthcare MagicSince you have hypothyroidism there will be disruption in normal menstrual cycle duration which makes cycles shorter than before. Also problem in ovulation will occur because of thyroid hormone deficiency and also high Prolactin usually associated with hypothyroidism. PCOS is a condition where hormone LH is high associated with high blood sugar due to Diabetes and also high male hormones like Androstenedione in most cases. If it is possible, do get tested for PCOS to rule it out. Miscarriages are common in hypothyroidism and may also be seen in PCOS. Main thing you have to do is to start losing weight which will help fertility drastically especially if you have PCOS. Avoid fatty, oily, junk food. Eat plenty of fresh fruits and green leafy vegetables. Drink plenty of water. Exercise daily by brisk walking for 40 minutes a day. Once you lose weight as well as maintain normal thyroid hormone levels, chance to conceive will be higher."},{"Patient":"Hi Doc, I am 28 year married woman trying to conceive but not successful yet.

Having a Kid is after 35 will take a long time as you have crossed that Period of conceiving easily and every woman will be born with a limited number of eggs. As you age, the quality of eggs decline and you may ovulate less often even if you have regular periods and your eggs may not be fertilized as easily. Since you have been trying it for 6 Months, you should be considering yourself examined by a Gynecologist and get a Opinion. But don't panic, as you will conceive but it will take longer, it also depends on your partner's age. The Younger the partner, the better chances. Continue having Unprotected sex every alternate day starting from 10th to 20th day of your cycle. Eat healthy nutritious balanced diet which should include fresh fruits and Green leafy vegetables. Avoid smoking and alcoholism. Avoid stress and Practice relaxation techniques like yoga and meditation. Once you conceive, schedule regular check up with your Doctor to see if the baby is dong fine.

If your periods are regular, be in contact with your husband every 2 to 3 days after your periods stop. It will increase chances of your pregnancy.  If your periods are irregular, then there can be a problem of ovulation.  So, then you can take some medicines like clomiphene for the growth of your follicles and track your follicles growth by repeated ultrasound and when your follicles is more than 17 to 18 mm, take injection for rupturing the follicles.  Be in contact with your husband for 2 to 3 days after injection.  Take progesterone for next 2 weeks.  Do a urine pregnancy test at home after that.  You can try like that for 3 to 6 months."}]`),O={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:S},data(){return{searchQuery:"",visibleCount:6,poemsData:M,isLoading:!1}},computed:{filteredPoems(){return this.searchQuery.trim()?this.poemsData.filter(a=>{const e=this.searchQuery.toLowerCase();return a.Patient.toLowerCase().includes(e)||a.Doctor.toLowerCase().includes(e)}).slice(0,this.visibleCount):this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(a=>setTimeout(a,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},E={class:"search-container"},R={class:"card-container"},C=["disabled"],N={key:0},Y={key:1};function W(a,e,l,u,i,r){const y=g("PoemCard");return o(),n("section",null,[e[3]||(e[3]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🤔 AI effective tips collection 🧠")])],-1)),t("div",E,[e[2]||(e[2]=t("span",{class:"search-icon"},null,-1)),f(t("input",{type:"text",class:"search-input","onUpdate:modelValue":e[0]||(e[0]=s=>i.searchQuery=s),placeholder:"Search..."},null,512),[[p,i.searchQuery]])]),t("div",R,[(o(!0),n(w,null,b(r.filteredPoems,(s,m)=>(o(),v(y,{key:m,poem:s},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),r.hasMorePoems?(o(),n("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:i.isLoading,onClick:e[1]||(e[1]=(...s)=>r.loadMore&&r.loadMore(...s))},[i.isLoading?(o(),n("span",Y,"Loading...")):(o(),n("span",N,"See more"))],8,C)):k("",!0)])}const j=c(O,[["render",W],["__scopeId","data-v-7efdf38f"]]),q=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"guide/35.md","filePath":"guide/35.md"}'),L={name:"guide/35.md"},F=Object.assign(L,{setup(a){return(e,l)=>(o(),n("div",null,[I(j)]))}});export{q as __pageData,F as default};
