It is normal natural process done by male or female to get orgasm and relax. However when your masturbation becomes compulsion and you feel restless or disturbed without doing that , than it's problem.If you doing daily 3 times since 5 years almost , it may affect your health.As masturbation also require some energy. To stop first you should know and be aware why you are doing, which purpose, what happened if you don't. After knowing these you can get some idea about stopping it.

I am very overweight, and my anxiety attacks are mainly illness phobia related ones. I am under alot of stress the last week, I have applied for an apartment that I am desperate to have. About an hour ago, I had a heart thumb. Skipped a beat. Etc. It frightened me, so I took a deep breath and it felt strange. This caused me to have an anxiety attack, and I had mild chest pain on the left bottom side and i got nervous and a little sick to my stomach. I believe most of these were symptoms from the following anxiety. I had an ECG in March because I went to the ER with arm pain. They said everything was fine and it was probably a muscle/nerve issue. I know, logically, that I'm fine. My doctor has told me that the heart does this to 'catch up' with itself. I don't want to go to the ER, I love 25 minutes away from the nearest hospital. The pain is gone, I am just still a little nervous. The only thing still bothering me is that I get a gassy rumbly feeling in my upper abdomen, sort of below my heart. I passed gas a few seconds later. Could that be gas, so close to my chest and heart?","Doctor":"Dear User,Thanks for using health care magic.From the available description it appears that you are having very problematic anxiety symptoms which needs to be addressed.

Last week I had blood work done because I have been getting light headed and very tired. My blood counts were good and no thyroid issue, sugar and iron were fine.

I was very nervous an attributed that to the readings. Since then, I have been so worried about the elevated enzymes that it has caused me to stress.

My current doctor doesn t believe me. My blood pressure at home averages 127/77. When I go into the doctor s office it goes sky high to 190/95 or more. I tried taking an ace inhibitor once that another doctor prescribed for me because of my high blood pressure in the office and bottomed out. I got the term bottomed out from my doctor when I described what happened after I took the drug. I happen to have a home blood pressure monitor and took my blood pressure after taking just one dose ( lowest dose of Altace) and my blood pressure went down to 55/46 and my pluse was very low also. I felt like all the life was drained out of me and I was so cold I shivered for hours (which is the only thing that was keeping me awake because I felt like blacking out) I was too weak to walk, dizzy if I tried to stand up, I was white in the face, and clammy....etc. I almost called for an ambulance. (maybe I should have) On another occassion I was given a nitro patch once in the hospital after going in for chest pain and had a really bad reaction to the nitro patch. In other words my heart stopped beating; but, they got me back by ripping off the nitro patch, turning me upside down and putting something in my IV. I was in the hospital for 10 days with them trying to find out why that happened. I know why it happened. It was the nitro patch. Nothing was wrong with my heart except for a mitral value click not even a prolapse. My current doctor did a heart ultra sound to see if my heart muscle was thick to prove to me I had high blood pressure. The results did come back with a certain degree of heart thickness (I m 62) ; but, he didn t stress taking blood pressure medication after that test was done. I don t know what to do with only having occassional high blood pressure when under stress like when I go to the doctor s, dentist....etc. and it s obvious I can t take blood pressure medication. Is this kind of blood pressure problem unhealthy and if it is what can I do about it. Would some kind of bio feedback training be helpful?

Depression can occur with regular stress and it can also occur biologically without any stress as well. You need proper treatment for the same. There are various effective therapies for depression like fluoxetine, venlafaxine, bupropion, mirtazapine or escitalopram and they are all very effective and mostly safe. You may also require some benzodiazepines like clonazepam or lorazepam for a short period like 2-3 weeks to reduce the anxiety and help with your sleep.  If you are averse to the drug therapies then there is also an option of cognitive behavioural therapy. This therapy is taken by either a psychologist or a psychiatrist in which the therapist identifies impaired cognitions (Thoughts) and try to correct them. They are 15-20 min weekly session and there should be around 8-10 sessions to help you with your illness.Hope I am able to answer your concerns.If you have any further query, I would be glad to help you.In future if you wish to contact me directly, you can use the below mentioned link:bit.ly/dr-srikanth-reddy"},{"Patient":"my nephew was on all kinds of medication for bi-polar, and other mental issues, rages, self infliction, hurting others, threating the police and other people in authority.

Once a person becomes sexually mature, semen production starts which is a continuous process. A person then either has sex, or masturbates and has night falls. Your wet dreams are occurring because you are not masturbating or having sex.Masturbation and wet dreams (nocturnal emission) are a normal physiological process. They don't lead to any physical or mental health problems. It also doesn't make anyone weak.Your weakness may be due to nutritional deficiency. You can consult a general physician to rule out any and get treated accordingly. Wet dreams has nothing to do with it. So, you just need to relax about having wet dreams or if you really want to stop it, masturbate. Both are completely normal. Hope this information was helpful.

I think he should be evaluated for diagnosis gain for better outcome.

You seem to be having anxiety disorder resulting in your fears. Its good to note that you are already on treatment and have responded favorably to it.Now, Nexito plus is a combination of two medicines, escitalopram 5 mg and clonazepam 0.5 mg. Escitalopram is an selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and an effective drug for your condition.However, since you have only responded partially, I feel the dose can be increased. The effective dose will be 10 mg/day and the maximum can be increased upto 20 mg/day depending on your response. I would also recommend that clonazepam should e tapered off, as long term benzodiazepine use will make it difficult to taper it off and can create dependence. You can discuss regarding these with your psychiatrist.In addition, you should also start exercising daily as that will help you relax. Relaxation exercises like deep breathing and progressive muscular relaxation will also be helpful. With proper treatment, I am sure you manage to do well.Wish you a speedy recovery and a great married life ahead.

Getting following blood test will help to rule out any organic cause behind these symptoms-   blood pressure reading, bl. sugar, Hb%, kidney and liver tests, TSH.If they are almost normal then the root cause is anxiety and can be managed with meds like- sertraline or paroxetine.

You seem to be preoccupied with lots of stuff and that is leading to your being stressed. Stress further causes confusion and hampers our ability to think straight.Regarding your friends, remember that fights among friends do happen. You have to patch up. If you friends are not talking to you, you should go ahead and clear things up. Friendship is precious and you just need to put some effort and it will be back on track.Regarding your masters, i feel you should think about what you really like and pursue it. You can also discuss with your parents regarding the options. Parents are always helpful and give us advice with our best possible interests in mind.Being attracted to someone at this age is usual. You should be happy about it and go ahead and talk to the guy and see if it works out.

I am a 15 year old female and for years I have suffered from chest pains, anxiety, seizures, dizzy spells, and insomnia. I have no idea whether any of it is related. The chest pains start rapidly at anytime of the day or night and could last for hours. Sometimes it it so painful it wakes me up. It mostly hurts from the middle of my chest to my left side. It hurts to breathe or move and feels deep in my chest. I have been to the doctors and they say it isn t my heart but it keeps getting worse. I have always been a worrier but my anxiety is really bad. I randomly feel like I m having panic attacks even when I m just sitting at home. I am an unofficially diagnosed epileptic and they say the stress caused my seizures. I was put on a few medications that had to keep being changed because of bad weight gain, allergic reactions and other problems. Most recently I was on Keppra. Before that was Epilum and Tegritol. The seizures have stopped now but sometimes I still feel like I m going to have one and I ve passed out a few times too. I get dizzy spells quite a bit. Sometimes when I m sitting or lying down it suddenly feels like I can t tell which way is up. Even though I know I m sitting up I feel like I m upside down or on my side. Other times when I stand up everything goes black and I get a bad pain in my head. I have to sit down to avoid falling over and after a couple of seconds it clears. I don t really know what insomnia is but I have always had trouble sleeping. Laying awake for hours and nightmares. I would feel so tired during the day and at night, even though I m still tired, I can t sleep. I m really concerned. I hate constant doctors visits, missing school, and feeling horrible all the time. This is ruining my life and I need some help.

I have been reading more and more about different mental disorders and I think I may have Pica, as a side symptom of OCD. I have been eating non food items since I was a child, but the craving for these substances did not begin until about the age of 13/14.I have been eating eraser heads all my life, but at the previously mentioned age I began to have a need for drywall and chalk. When the drywall was taken away, I relied more heavily on chalk. I am now sixteen, and my mouth begins to salvate at the thought of chalk, which I cannot obtain. I now eat mass amounts of paper, about 8 sheets a day. I have tried stopping and removing myself from these substances, but then I just create a craving for a different substance. I am in high school, and paper is a bit hard to get away from.I think this may be a side effect of OCD, as just recently (at the age of about 14) I began having a hard time taking tests and concentrating on h.w. I check my answers at least three times before moving on, and cannot stop myself. I am in gifted, and used to be an excellent test taker. Now, not so much. I also have to have hand sanitizer on me at all times, and wash my hands many times throughout the day.I think the pica may be out of iron deficiency, as I was borderline anemic about a year ago.I'm in International Baccalaureate, Mensa, and will soon be applying for college.

Doctor i can only pray, cause there are other lives attached to mine and i dont want to see them destroyed like mine. What should i do , Pray?","Doctor":"Hi,I read your query and from what you have mentioned, you seem to be having symptom suggestive of social anxiety disorder. It leads to one becoming very anxious in front of others and not able to communicate well as in your case. In addition, you have started using sasmoproxyvon which contains an opioid drug dextropropoxyphene. It leads to dependence and is very harmful causing physical, emotional and financial effects.I suggest that you should seek a psychiatric consultation. Treatment for social anxiety will include medications like sertraline or paroxetine. In addition you can also opt for behavior therapy sessions. You will also need treatment for opioid dependence which will include initial detoxification by managing withdrawal symptoms. Thereafter, long term prophylaxis with naltrexone can be started.Hope this information was helpful. Best wishes."},{"Patient":"sir my sister behavior is looking change from tommarow .

Your sister seems to be stressed out due to not being able to perform as per her own expectation in the exams. As a result, she seems preoccupied regarding the same. Moreover, she is also comparing herself with her brothers which is making the problems worse.I suggest that you seek a psychiatric consultation for her. She would need supportive therapy sessions to help her move on and overcome the stress that she is facing right now. If her symptoms are more distressing, treatment with anti-depressant medications can be considered.I do hope that this information was helpful.

You seemingly are having ruminations which can be due to underlying anxiety or depression. Excessively worrying about something and not able to get over that thought is intrinsic to anxiety.I would suggest that you seek a psychiatric consultation for your condition. Treatment with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors like paroxetine would be helpful. You can also consider cognitive behavior therapy which will include multiple sessions focusing on learning relaxation and helping you change the maladaptive thinking pattern.Hope this information was helpful.

Fortwin contains pentazoscine which is an opioid drug. It causes dependence and leads to withdrawal symptoms when you try to quit. In addition, you also might be suffering form an underlying depressive episode which will need evaluation too.I would suggest that you seek a psychiatric consultation for treatment. You can even consider inpatient treatment as that will help take care of withdrawal symptoms in a better way.  Treatment will include initial detoxification by managing withdrawal symptoms symptomatically. Thereafter, long term prophylaxis with naltrexone can be started which will help reduce craving for fortwin.

It is highly unlikely that it is due to citalopram. Citalopram  is not reported to cause any such side effects.Your lump can be purely incidental.

Currently, you are weight conscious, but not bulimic.  In bulimia, patients do binge eating and purging, or consuming a large amount of food in a short amount of time followed by an attempt to rid him or herself of the food consumed (purging), typically by vomiting, taking a laxative, diuretic, or stimulant, and/or excessive exercise, because of an extensive concern for body weight. You have few of these symptoms. Thanks"},{"Patient":"I have a sister who is mentally retarded aged 40 years.  From last two months she is behaving abnormal.

All your symptoms are explainable on the basis of depression.Since you are already harbouring suicidal thoughts, it is recommended that you seek a psychiatric consultation without any further delay.

Ok so im a 15 year old guy , and recently ( a week ago or so) noticed a pea sized reddish lump on the skin of my scrotum ( leftside at the bottom). Recently it has been tender to touch, and from what i can feel , it is much like a spot. Bubble on top with an semi flat surface underneath. I woke up this morning to find a clear liquid coming from it (cyst?) and the swelling had reduced by around half. I'm going to head to the doctors next week, but i am worried this may be a tumor or even cancer, please respond and thank you in advance","Doctor":"Hi, Lumps and swellings in the testicles are a relatively common symptom in boys and men, and can have a number of different causes. The vast majority of testicular lumps and swellings are caused by benign (non-cancerous) conditions that may not need treatment. Some of the main causes are: varicoceles, hydroceles – swellings caused by a build-up of fluid around the testicle, epididymal cysts and inguinal hernias. Some more serious issues such as tumors and carcinomas are less common but should be considered if there is pain and rapid growth of it. In every case, it would be good to do ultrasound of testicles by urologist and this will show us what type of issue this is. If this is benign then there is no need for urgent treatment unless there is pain and inflammation. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further. Wishing you all the best.

A small stone in the ureter that has passed on above from the kidney which is lodged in ureter, can be responsible for this pain. Urinalysis, X ray KUB/ Ultrasound abdomen pelvis should be done. If none are found then neuromuscular disorders should be worked up. A physical exam would indicate whether its a leg/groin/hip joint issue or a back/spine problem.

I am semi bi-polar and I suffer from clinical depression. I am on medication for it-Nuzak and Walbutren. I always hide the scars... I always feel like I could just and hurt myself. I hold a knife for dinner and all I think about is slicing it through my arms... Over the weekend I had a friends knife which was apparently very sharp. I cut my upper arm 6 times, only one of them actually leaving a slight mark... I could easily do it again... I ve been doing well on my medication, but it hasn t stopped the self-harm tendencies. I was only diagnosed when I was 16 with my depression-I am now 19-because I was too afraid to speak out. I think about suicide roughly once or twice a week, and on bad days or weeks, everyday and several times a day... I have some scars which I will always have now, it doesn t bother me too much... I know that it is not for attention because I don t tell anyone and I always hide it... I wrote this a few weeks ago : Pain. The only thing I can think about. Physical pain… Emotional pain… Like a plague has been set free on my mind and all it has brought is the thought of pain. The thought of hurting. Hurting myself. I don’t know why. I just know that all I want to do is cause myself pain. I look down at my arms and all I see are passed scars. All I think about is making new ones. Seeing the blood run down my arm, my thighs. The feeling of-not pain but rather pleasure-coursing through my body. The woozy feeling I sometimes get, when everything starts to slowly spin, like I have succeeded in achieving what I wanted in the first place. I think about death. Everyday. And no matter what I try, I feel I want to die, I feel I need to die but never seem to have the strength to actually commit suicide. So instead I inflict pain to make myself feel something. To remind myself daily of the ‘need’ I have to be in pain. The weaknesses I have to cause pain instead of killing myself. Every time I look at my scars, I’m just reminded of the feelings that pulsated through my body to cause the scars in the first place. A constant reminder that I’m weak. Too weak to just kill myself and end it all. The closest thing I have to death is the self-inflicted pain. It feels like I am going through life barely breathing, barely hanging on, yet full of lively scars. Scars that laugh in my face. Scars that tell me just how worthless I really am. As if that’s not enough there’s still my urge to cause even more pain. More scars. I think of hurting myself non-stop. I think of what it would be like to just get knocked by a car. Stabbed or shot. I see a pair of scissors or a knife and all I really want to do is slide it through my skin and watch the blood drip down. Not once, or twice but several times. Until there’s so much blood it stains my skin and clothes. I see a lighter or a fire, and all I want to do is burn my skin. Feel the sharp sting as the heat melts away at my skin. I want all this to happen. I want to do all of this but not die. And I don’t understand that. I want to experience the pain and live through it, even though there is no reason to live. I want to hurt myself and have a near-death experience, but not really die. I’m not afraid of death. At all. It’s all I think about really. What I’m scared of is being in hospital, or dying somewhere and having no one there. No friends. No one to come and say goodbye and cry by my side as I slowly drift away into the unknown. No one there to hold my hand and say “I love you.” No one there to say that everything is going to be all right. That we will get through it together. Just me. Alone. I know there is something clearly wrong with me... And I ve tried to research whether It s so bad that I need to be treated for it... I am scared of the pain, but I still do it anyway. I don t mind the hurt or the scars, I m just scared because I want something bad to happen to me but I don t want to be the one who caused it. I self-harm but it s not the same. If I need to be treated for this, I won t be able to because my family can t afford it. I couldn t go to university because my family couldn t afford it. I m too scared to tell this to my doctor or to even tell my mom I need to go and see her. In a few weeks I am leaving to China to work as an English teacher. If I tell my mom I need to go to the doctor and tell my doctor this, she won t let me go and I NEED to go. I ve had some trouble with my sexuality. I am gay. I have finally realized it and I am okay with it. But I am too scared to tell anyone. My neighbor knows and she s the only one. A few guys from online websites too obviously. Write now while typing this, I m thinking of seeing my own blood... I m thinking about what it would be like to cause so much pain and torture that I end up in hospital. I m thinking of it, I want to do it, but I also can t bring myself to do it. I try but then ease up. I never forget the thoughts though... Every time I have to go to the bathroom to shit, there is blood and I can t tell my doctor or my mom. I have Phimosis, researched how to stretch the foreskin, but then am too lazy and just don t do it. I am addicted to sweets and feel obese. I am trying to stop sweets and it s hard. I want to workout and get that amazing body, but am too lazy and just don t. I tried intermittent fasting for a while. Also didn t work too well. I have bad facial skin and want no pimples or blackheads or anything. But I m too lazy to wash my face. I m 19 and have hardly any hair under my arms... It s probably not a big deal but it bothers me. I want to shave my pubic hair on my nut sack, but don t know how to without cutting my balls. I want to shave my ass but also don t know how to without slicing my ass up. All of that I know is done independently and through experience. I feel too lazy to even try and experiment. Even manscaping I feel too lazy to do sometimes. But I guess I m typing this to you for advice, help and anything else that I might need to be informed about. I know that I need help but I don t know what extent that help needs to be from. I feel like I don t even want to stop hurting myself. I just know that I have to. That it s not normal... I tried turning to God but I am not religious and don t believe in him. Please. Any help and advice or anything would be greatly appreciated. I feel like I don t want to send this message, but I know I have to. This tells me I feel that I don t want to get better. I just know that I need to.","Doctor":"HiThanks for using healthcare magicI think, you are a patient of bipolar depression and in that case, you may have severe depression as compared to unipolar depression.

This way, we can tell what the exact composition of the semen is and what the blood in it is all about. Blood in semen could be caused by excessive sexual activity or masturbation, an infection, a prostate disease, etc. However, I will want to think that excessive sexual activity is probably the cause. This will be confirmed by the absence of no other findings suggestive of an infection. In all, probably linked to excessive sexual activity. Semen analysis would help with this.

You should check with the doctors about this. Regarding mental anxiety and depression, such a state came out of natural negative thinking about the ensuing event. Such thoughts are always there with a patient who is at fate's mercy. Therefore, it might take a lot of time to recover and some times psychiatric intervention may become a necessary.  The recovery is totally dependent on the patient's attitude itself. Prayer and patients belief always pays.

Sexual arousal (also sexual excitement) is the arousal of sexual desire, during or in anticipation of sexual activity. A number of physiological responses occur in the body and mind as preparation for sex and continue during it. In addition to the psychological arousal, several hormones affect sexual arousal, including testosterone, cortisol, and estradiol. Therefore, in simple medical understanding, removal of testicles cannot, at least in theory, ease the mental temptation to have sex.If you require more of my help in this aspect, Please post a direct question to me in this website.

Only med that works for her after ten tears.  Last three months WBC went from 9 to 7.7 to 6.3.  Still within normal range so for now she can continue with this med but I feel somewhat concerned about  the declining numbers.  Is this a pattern that precedes a crucial drop in WBC and what is the normal fluctuating WBC from month to month in non consumers of clozaril?  As you might guess it is crucial that she be able to continue on this med.  if not I have read that there are things we might consider to stimulate production of blood cells.  I have differentials if required.  I know the future is uncertain but anything you can tell me about cause of fluctuations, viruses, nutrition etc. much appreciated.   Concerned mom.","Doctor":"Hello,I can understand your concern very well. The only major problem with clozaril is neutropenia which can develop at any time during treatment. One point is that when the neurtophil count goes down below normal level -we stop the drug. Second is - if there is a constant fall in WBC or neurtophil numbers for three consecutive readings, again it is advisable to stop this drug even if the counts are within range ( this fact is not much known, so often missed).To prevent the blood count falls- we recomemend Iron and folic acid and zinc tablets when we start clozapine.Along with them it is advisable to - eat more green leafy vegetables and fruits like pomegranate, amla ( indian gooseberries) and other fruits which have propensity to make blood.Its not proven scientifically, but in a condition called dengue- in India, several peopel are usually affected ( in this disease the also the blood counts fall significantly and become fatal some times)- a natural method which is parcticed successfully (along with normal medical methods)- juice of papaya plant leaves is given to the patients twice or thice  a day for few days-  (and the blood counts rise).so, if need arise you may try it if you feel.Rest is - monitor blood count closely; also keep a.check that she dosent develop fever or body aches.Start iron folic acid and zinc supplements.

Sometimes I could function and work through my spells sometimes I would have to go on an anxiety med. This has been a rough year and my doctor has me on Xanax xr 3mg 1x a day and ambien 10 mg. to sleep. After the assault he added one to two 1 mg Xanax as needed.

I read online where several people all receiving symptom improvement from phenobarbital. I know my mom gave me these in a drop form as a child (panic attacks started at 6) but I also know from my research that the withdrawal can kill you.

A temporary condition, it is often associated with migraines, brain tumors and the use of psychoactive drugs. The hallmark sign of AIWS is a migraine and AIWS may in part be caused by the migraine.

The antibiotic course also should be given according to the semen culture as presence of leukocyte points towards infection. Kindly attach your husband's semen report to give detail comment.

This young man has also begun stealing from people and he describes that it is like an addiction, where he wakes up thinking about stealing.

He is defiant at home, his grades are falling, he's lost interest in the things he used to do, such as baseball.  The adults don't forgive him and they've stripped him of a phone, a bedroom door, etc. and have given him no way to earn things back.  This young man says he's not suicidal; he's using pot.

How do I get the parents to understand this behavior is very much about them?","Doctor":"HiThanks for using healthcare magicI think, he has conduct disorder or cannabis induced psychosis and in that case, he needs proper mental evaluation by psychiatrist. If he has conduct disorder, then he needs behavioral therapy. Being a counselor, you can try positive and negative reinforcement in his case. That would help to modify his behavior.

I would like to describe an event that happened two nights ago which could have been an episode of TIA, and value your opinion. BARE FACTS AS I CAN RECALL THEM. My husband & I each have an upstairs and downstairs apartment. They are not inter-joined. You get from 1 apartment to the other by means of an outside staircase.  I went to sleep upstairs and he was immediately below me, downstairs. I was in a highly stressed state & to help me sleep I took 1x10mg Adco-Zolpidem Hemitartrate & 1x 0.5mg  Adco-Alzam  (benzodiazepine). I soon went to sleep. I think I \\"woke up\\" falling down the outside staircase (not sure) but our night guard found  me lying prone on the  outside pavement. He tried to help me up but my whole body was trembling violently, including my arms and legs. I was reeling, unable to walk, and crashing against the surrounding walls & fences. He called another guard and, together they helped me up a short staircase to the doorway belonging to my husbands apartment. He could not rouse my deeply sleeping husband so left me propped up against his door while he went off to phone an ambulance. He returned to find me asleep against the door. The two guards helped me up the outside staircase to my apartment where the door was wide open, and put me to bed. I slept for two hours and was awakened by two paramedics & the 2 guards. (4 people, but I \\"saw\\" about 7 people in my room! ) Nevertheless I was more coherent and declined their offer to transport me to hospital. They took my blood pressure which was fine and I was able to stand and walk. They left me to sleep. The next morning I woke up full of bruises & abrasions and my whole body was extremely stiff. I have been fine, though tender for two days. I had thought that my episode was the result of the interaction between the two tablets. (although I had taken a similar dose twice very recently). It was only last night that a friend suggested I could have experienced a TIA, and that the reason I was wandering around outside was that I was seeking help. I have been surfing the net and have learned that there is a high correlation between stress and TIA. I have been in an exceptionally high level of acute stress and anxiety for 4 months. I also smoke. Being Christmas time, doctors are scarce, and so I would value your opinion: was it the drug interaction, or could I have experienced TIA?Thank you very much. Fran Lawrence.","Doctor":"Hi It is rarest possibilities of drug interaction cause this much of problem. So as per my opinion drug interaction is rule out.TIA.??? TIA can result from sudden occlusion of blood vessels in brain. Did u have any problem like hypertension , diabetes, obesity??  Addiction??Because this  are the risk factor of TIA. If u have been hospitalized?? Than CT scan is must and it is best reveal whether it is TIA or not.U have to undrgone basic inveatigations for risk factors and if CT scan suggest TIA than u would have take Medication regularly and try to modified risk factors that I have mentioned.Thank you"},{"Patient":"I have been diagnosed with depression in 1999.

So, may be by incresing the dosage of any of fluoxetine or bupropion can help...if not , then it would be better to shift her to venalafaxine.Lithium is given in complicated and severe depression...so, it should be continued but levels are monitored to watch for presence of side effects. Or - if they are below range - one may increase dose if needed.So, ideally, if managed properly, there is no need for modafinil..it has been given for lethargy : which is a part of untreated depression.and would go when things are properly managed.get her thyroid levels, kidney  tests, completle blood counts and ECG ( as she is on lithium) and treat if there are some.issues with tests.Please discuss the above points with her treating team.

I suggest you not to worry much. There is nothing to worry about such type of forgetting. This is not memory loss. Such a situation is normally called \\"tip of tongue phenomenon\\". The tip-of-the-tongue phenomenon (TOT), sometimes called presque vu, is the failure to retrieve a word from memory, combined with partial recall and the feeling that retrieval is imminent. The causes of TOTs are largely unknown but numerous explanations have been offered, but they are beyond discussion usefulness here. You just have nothing to worry about your condition and ignore it.If you require more of my help in this aspect, Please post a direct question to me in this website.

I suggest you not to worry much. I am afraid to suggest here that your wife could be suffering from Paranoid personality disorder (PPD). It is a mental disorder characterized by paranoia and a pervasive, long-standing suspiciousness and generalized mistrust of others. Individuals with this personality disorder may be hypersensitive, easily feel slighted, and habitually relate to the world by vigilant scanning of the environment for clues or suggestions that may validate their fears or biases. Paranoid individuals are eager observers. They think they are in danger and look for signs and threats of that danger, potentially not appreciating other evidence.Best method of treatment is to consult a psychiatrist as soon as possible and start prescription medicines and then combine it with psychotherapy. If treated earlier, success rate is multifold. If you require more of my help in this aspect, Please post a direct question to me in this website.

It stills is different as of now when I'm typing this. I'm 15 and I just cannot focus on anything, It seems as if everything has changed.

About 2 days ago I came home from school and slept literally from 4PM to 6AM the next morning. Whenever I have to go take a poop, I usually have diarrhea which sucks. Also when I am in school I can't really focus anymore, I just don't care about what the teacher is saying that much because I feel like crap.. Whenever I have to read something I cannot focus on the words and I can't really think about what I am reading. We had to do a project where I had to research on this famous writer and my friends thought It was easy and for me it was hard due to the fact that I can't focus.

I had one day to memorize all the parts of the heart and I aced the test. So yeah, and about the marijuana thing I don't really do marijuana that much only sometimes. Even if marijuana wasn't the cause of this which I'm about 99% sure it's not I still will not do it again this day forward. I always want asprin now because usually I have a headache, and It just doesn't seem as if my brain is functioning like it use too, I don't really think things are all that funny anymore my vision is fuzzy and I don't really like to look people in the eye... I don't know this is all just so weird I really hope one of you can maybe help me find a solution to this problem because it really sucks!

Amphetamine and duloxetine do have interactions. Duloxetine has the propensity to increase the likelihood of side effects of amphetamine like tremors and restlessness. There is also a risk of a very rare condition called serotonin syndrome. This condition occurs very rarely but has significant symptoms. It can lead to confusion, nausea, vomiting, palpitations, fever, sweating, tremors, and increase the risk of seizure. Both the medications can be used together though. But in case of any of the above mentioned symptoms, please do contact your doctor without any delay. Hope this information was helpful.

So even though he does not have many positive characteristics , she puts up with him and his family. I understand your concerns of being a mother. Its difficult to see your child make a mistake. Rather than bluntly asking her to come and stay with you , try to understand why she's staying with him despite all the work she is made to do. Be her support and not her critique. She's an adult and the more you'll try to impose your ideas on her , she'll deviate from you. Even though , she would know its wrong and unstable.

From what you have mentioned, you seem to be suffering from anxiety disorder. It seems that you are having repetitive thoughts regarding the same and you understand such thoughts are irrational. Such thoughts can be termed as obsessions and the repeated cleaning or washing in response to the thoughts can be termed compulsions. Obsessive compulsive disorder is a type of anxiety disorder which is not uncommon. I would have liked to know about any other thoughts that might be coming repeatedly to you like any doubts (and repeated checking in response to that), repeated sexual or religious thoughts. I would suggest you seek a psychiatric consultation for detailed evaluation of your symptoms and starting proper treatment. Your condition can be treated effectively with medications like fluvoxamine or sertraline (one of the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors). You will have to be patient about the response as the medicines will take at least 10-15 days to show its effect. The treatment will be long term and you will need regular follow-ups.Hope this information was helpful.

From what you have mentioned, it seems that you are having panic attacks. Panic attacks are sudden heightening if anxiety associated with restlessness, tremors, increased heart rate, sweating and feeling that one might die, or have heart attack or go crazy.Recurrent panic attacks can occur as part of panic disorder which can be present with or without other anxiety disorders or depression. I would suggest that you seek a psychiatric consultation for detailed evaluation of your symptoms and proper management. Had I been your psychiatrist, i would have ordered few investigations initially including ECG, complete blood counts and thyroid profile to rule out any underlying medical condition. Treatment with one of the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI) like escitalopram or paroxetine would be effective. Short term course of benzodiazepines can be given initially for controlling anxiety as the SSRIs take 10-15 days to show its effect. In addition, you can start exercising daily which will help you relax.Hope this information was helpful.

You should avoid intercourse for till symptoms persist and drink plenty of fluids. If symptoms persist it would be good to do a prostate ultrasound and check your PSA levels to rule out a prostate tumor or hypertrophy and further treatment depends on these findings. In most cases, it can be controlled with medications but sometimes, in case of a tumor, open surgery is required.

I do not shave the shaft of my penis so i know it cannot be an ingrown hair, and have not been sexually active for at least 6 months, and used protection when i was. Any insight into what this could be is greatly appreciated","Doctor":"Hello, Clinically the lesions are present as a pearly white dome-shaped bump on the affected area. The whitish ball coming after extraction is molluscum body. Most of the time the lesions may resolve by its own but some may remain and can become slightly larger. In these cases, once any lesion remains then there is the further possibility of more eruptions from one lesion. Therefore, in my opinion, any of the bump if remaining should be treated properly. I treat my patient with simple extraction with a needle or by Chemical Cautery or by extraction and needling. There is nothing to be worried about the same and can be very well treated. I suggest you to not pinch, pop or squeeze the area. For the redness: it appears that you have developed \\"contact allergic dermatitis\\" at the areas. Let me explain you elaborately. The penile skin is the thinnest skin in the body and is such a soft and thin skin that even the blood vessels are visible sometimes from our naked eye. Some redness is always present on penile skin. Adding to it the thinnest skin of the body over glans is also sensitive to the friction plus the chemicals in day to day life. All these factors also lead to the kind of problem which you are facing. Mild to moderate redness is quite common in this area because of the friction during sexual intercourse or due to masturbation also. Even the condoms are known to produce redness because of the rubber content as well as certain chemicals on the condoms as lubricants and as a fragrance. Hope I have answered your query.

Now the real problem is - taking him to a psychiatrist. You can take him forcefully at least once...by taking help from neighbourers or family relatives? Being a psychiatrist I can very well understand your situation and how much your family has suffered. It is a common problem with psychotic patients who are also the head of the family- noone is able to take them to doctor against their will...however, if a female is ill- at least one can take her forcefully & treat her against her wish..Usually, a psychiatrist is required to see the patient in person before he can prescribe the medicine.There are several drug formulations availabe ( colorless, odorless liquids, sprinkles, etc) which can be mixed in food of the patient without their knowledge.Also, once the meds are started, Im sure your life will change for better, much more than you can think of..Drugs like resperidpne/ olanzapine, etc., are good and effective molecule commonly used in these illnesses.High education is no gurantee of sound mental health, neither are all spheres of life get affected by this illness simultaneously- but, slowly every part of life- job, family and health starts to suffer.So, please call a doctor, may be take him by force and start one of  the above meds after discussing with treating team.Wish you good luckDr. Manisha GopalMD Psychiatry"},{"Patient":"what is the best anti-axiety med for a 78 yr old woman taking plavix, crestor and BP meds, has 3 stents, but otherwise in good health.

Borderline personality disorder is different. I quote Wikipedia - Borderline personality disorder (BPD) (called emotionally unstable personality disorder, emotional intensity disorder, or borderline type) is a cluster-B personality disorder, the essential feature of which is a pattern of marked impulsivity and instability of affects, interpersonal relationships and self image. The pattern is present by early adulthood and occurs across a variety of situations and contexts.Other symptoms usually include intense fears of abandonment and intense anger and irritability, the reason for which others have difficulty understanding. People with BPD often engage in idealization and devaluation of others, alternating between high positive regard and great disappointment.Self-harm and suicidal behavior are common.Therefore, anger and irritation alone cannot be termed as BPD. This could be stress. We need to find out the origin of the stress and motivate her to either adjust with it or to avoid that circumstance.In any case, she needs the intervention of a counselor or a well wisher whom she trusts.

In your case, it may be an STD (sexually transmitted disease). Chlamydia is a sexually transmitted disease sometimes causing painful urination, penile discharge and more. Gonorrhea is a sexually transmitted disease and can cause painful urination and penile discharge. In cases of infection, a diagnosis can be made by taking a urine sample or urethral swab, and can usually be cleared by a course of antibiotics. In the case of a sexually transmitted infection, it is recommended that sexual partners are also treated. Antibiotic treatment will be helpful for you. Continue applying antifungal ointment. The most secure way of prevention is definitely sustaining from sexual intercourse. Another option is to be in a long-term monogamous relationship with an uninfected partner.

Your brother should definitely know that an authority is watching him and this authority happens to be his elder brother, who has concerns about him, loves him and want to guide him.Second thing you have to do is - You need to divert his energy into more useful things such as career, education, health, games etc. Motivate him to participate in games without mentioning the health effects of drinking. Motivate him to work extra time for the sake of his career or education without mentioning anything about drinking.

The vast majority of testicular lumps and swellings are caused by benign (non-cancerous) conditions that may not need treatment. Some of the main causes are: varicoceles, hydroceles – swellings caused by a build-up of fluid around the testicle, epididymal cysts and inguinal hernias. Some more serious issues such as tumors and carcinomas are less common but should be considered if there is pain and rapid growth of it. In every case, it would be good to do an ultrasound of testicles by a urologist and this will show us what type of issue this is.

Also when I wake in morning the bloating feeling disappears but returns after an hour or so.. I have no problems eating digesting etc. I have no medical history..","Doctor":"Hi, To recapitulate: Male/49 - pain 'under' the right testicle - not the actual testicle - very uncomfortable - comes and goes - sometimes the pain is outside on the skin where the testicle sits - frankincense oil calms the skin pain alone and not the internal. Since you have provided the specific history, this looks to be an inflamed part of the epididymis that is near the lower part of the testis. Since the skin is just lying in vicinity the pain may be felt in the skin and applying the frankincense oil can take care of the skin sensation and as it can not go through the skin to be effective at the inflamed part. Other possible causes can be varicocele. This can be diagnosed by the following: Clinical evaluation by a General Surgeon or preferably a Urologist. Color doppler with ultrasound can help further clarify. Tests of blood and urine can give further clue. Till then you can have scrotal support. Hope I have answered your query.

Other health problems, such as diabetes, high blood pressure, anxiety, and depression. Side effects of certain medicines. Stress. Drinking too much alcohol or smoking.

Also, talking about the issue with your partner, doing sensual exercises, and getting counseling may be beneficial. Finding and then stopping medicines that may be causing the problem. In some cases, you can take a different medicine that doesn't cause erection problems. Taking prescription medicine that can help you get erections.

Clinical depression is far more complicated than compared to disappointment. You are disappointed with your looks. About your teeth. You made it a habit to avoid showing your teeth, which developed into an unwanted behavior or obsession. You are obsessed with your teeth and thoughts about your teeth. That is the reason for your present behavior. I do not understand, why you are worrying when there are so many ways to repair your teeth. Understand your handicap and search for alternatives. You have alternatives. Cosmetic teeth treatment or maxilofacial surgery are options. Consult a competent dentist for further advise.

From what you have mentioned, I could infer that you are suffering from some sort of anxiety disorder, most probably social phobia. It is a condition where a person becomes anxious in public situations and fears embarrassment. As  a result he becomes very conscious of himself. The good news is that your condition is amenable to treatment. You should seek a psychiatric consultation for your condition. Treatment with medications like paroxetine or sertraline is effective. In addition, you can also consider treatment option of cognitive behavior therapy where regular sessions are taken focusing on teaching relaxation and helping you change behavior and thinking pattern. You can discuss regarding the same with the psychiatrist.Hope the information provided was helpful.

The symptoms that you have mentioned are highly suggestive of an underlying psychotic process and in this case it is likely that your friend is suffering from schizophrenia. She seem to be having visual and auditory hallucinations, thought broadcasting, etc. which are all symptoms of schizophrenia.She needs treatment with anti-psychotics. Generally such patients refuse treatment initially. But once treatment is started and they start gaining insight regarding their illness, they do start complying. Depot injectables is something which can be tried in patients who refuse to take oral medications.As for you, if you are close to her, you can try to persuade her for treatment. You can also discuss with her family regarding the option for considering in-patient treatment for few days so that treatment can be initiated.Hope this information was helpful.

Is there a solution.","Doctor":"Hello, Let's make something clear here in this situation. Often males in our society do a thing to show their masculinity/maleness, which is to compare length of the penis with each other. These things just make yourself more anxious and make you feel inferior. Please don't get indulged in these talks. the length of the penis doesn't matter much, if you are able to penetrate or insert your penis inside vagina, then it is well and good. Also, take notice that the only sensitive area of the vagina is the outer most portion for 1-2 inches, and inside is actually insensitive area, where it doesn't make any difference if the penis touches or not. And it is quite normal if the penis has deviated towards one side, don't get too nervous about it. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further. Take care Regards, Dr SHOBHIT KUMAR PRASAD, Psychiatrist"},{"Patient":"I am 29 years old... I am a full time mother of 3. Daughter 8 Daughter 4 Son 8 months I m usually the only parent in house & has been like this since 1st was born due 2 father working away! I know it s natural as a mother to feel tired and stressed. But I can go from being happy to extremely down in matter of seconds. I don t like socialising much, yet being in the house all the time drives me crazy, but in saying that I d rather stay home. I get as much sleep as I can some nights are better then others. I stress a lot about everything & anything & seem to lash out (definately not physically) at my 2 daughters a lot even if they are not doing anything wrong. I cry a lot & always have the urge to yell as I find it really hard to control my temper. When kids father comes home majority of the time I m unhappy with him with everything & anything he does even though he trying to help me! I feel like I want to just be away from everyone especially the ones I m taking my moods out on as I know they don t like me for it! I feel exhausted all the time, it s hard for me to feel happy or to control any situation without getting really cranky or upset. I love my kids my family but each day feels like another battle & most nights I lay in bed awake upset dreading waking up in the morning to face the world all over again!","Doctor":"Hi,I read your problem in detail and can understand the situation that you seem to be going through. Your stressful conditions certainly seems to have an effect on you which are resulting in the symptoms that you are having currently. You seem to be suffering from depression. It is a condition characterized by low mood, irritability, tiredness, crying spells, sleep and appetite disturbances. I would suggest that you seek a psychiatric consultation and complete evaluation and proper management. Medications like selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors like escitalopram and sertraline, etc are safe and effective. in addition, try to exercise on a daily basis. You can also start regular therapy sessions with your psychiatrist, where you will be able to express your emotions  and let out whats building up inside you at ease.Hope this information was helpful.

Risperidone total dose is 4 mg which i think also insufficient.Why there is 150 mg sertraline if you are suffering from schizophrenia as sertraline is an antidepressant drug?

I have gotten panic attacks before, but they re not my main concern at all, my main concern is that anxiety feeling I have everyday over very silly things, and if it would be appropriate to use xanax ?","Doctor":"DearWe understand your concernsI went through your details. I suggest you not to worry much.  If you know the reason for your silly and small panicky thoughts, why do you want to ask about anxiety medication. Why don't you treat the root cause, the cause itself? Is it not necessary?Anxiety, worries and panick attaks come when you are being idle. Remember, \\"IDLE MIND IS DEVIL'S WORKSHOP\\". You are actually fearing the fear itself. Past incidents are just incidents. They gave you positive lessons and experiences which you are supposed to carry forward and use in your future. Instead you are carrying \\"just\\" incidents. How can incidents worry you? A snake can startle you, but can a picture of a snake? A picture can startle you if you are worried about it, you start fearing the picture also. I think I am making myself clear. Your treatment is psychotherapy. Not anxiety medicines. Start with these steps:Step 1 - Practice Deep and full breathing whenever possibleStep 2 - Drink plenty of water and fruit juices. Step 3 - A Tomato a day keeps anxiety at bayStep 4 - Exercise regularlyStart these and follow strictly. After 7 days please post a direct question to me in this website.

Each time I got up the dizziness returned could you tell what caused this symptom. I am currently on holiday here and now have some concerns about altitude. Thanks much for your reply p.s.The same thing happened to one of my sisters who visited. Can the info be e-mailed?","Doctor":"DearWe understand your concernsI went through your details. I suggest you not to worry much.  Acrophobia is an extreme or irrational fear of heights, especially when one is not particularly high up. It belongs to a category of specific phobias, called space and motion discomfort that share both similar etiology and options for treatment. Most people experience a degree of natural fear when exposed to heights, especially if there is little or no protection.Acrophobia sufferers can experience a panic attack in a high place and become too agitated to get themselves down safely. \\"Vertigo\\" is often used (incorrectly) to describe a fear of heights, but it is more accurately a spinning sensation that occurs when one is not actually spinning. It can be triggered by looking down from a high place, or by looking straight up at a high place or tall object.Drugs can seem very effective in the short term, but they are not a cure. Anxiety medication can provide temporary relief, but it doesn’t treat the underlying cause of the disorder. Once you stop taking the drug, usually all the symptoms of fear of heights return in full force. There have been a number of promising studies into using \\"virtual reality\\" (a form of psychotherapy) as a treatment for acrophobia. Virtual reality (VR), sometimes referred to as immersive multimedia, is a computer-simulated environment that can simulate physical presence in places in the real world or imagined worlds. For the time being, you can ignore your condition because you are not going to be in such places often.

I suggest you not to worry much. First of all, why are you worried about not being able to address a crowd? Everyone cannot do everything.

What you should understand is OCD is certainly curable.Washing hands over and over is due to the hygiene sense you have developed. Such a behavior is not bad unless it hinders your normal activity. Such behavior goes on only when you do not have any other activities. Fare enough, that means, keeping yourself busy and ignoring the behavior, more or less, can reduce the incidents.

Depression can occur with regular stress and it can also occur biologically without any stress as well. You need proper treatment for the same. There are various effective therapies for depression like fluoxetine, venlafaxine, bupropion, mirtazapine or escitalopram and they are all very effective and mostly safe. You may also require some benzodiazepines like clonazepam or lorazepam for a short period like 2-3 weeks to reduce the anxiety and help with your sleep.  If you are averse to the drug therapies then there is also an option of cognitive behavioural therapy. This therapy is taken by either a psychologist or a psychiatrist in which the therapist identifies impaired cognitions (Thoughts) and try to correct them. They are 15-20 min weekly session and there should be around 8-10 sessions to help you with your illness.Hope I am able to answer your concerns.If you have any further query, I would be glad to help you.In future if you wish to contact me directly, you can use the below mentioned link:bit.ly/dr-srikanth-reddy"},{"Patient":"Hello, doctor i am from chennai. i have faced many problems in my life. i get wex many times about my life. i want to be bold but i not able to be like that. i feel like what a life ? why should i live in this world? why i try to do my own job but not able to get success in that? in my life every thing got unsuccessful get very aware about myself that not fit for anything.i get so anger because of that/ i hate myself my self about this. pl suggest me","Doctor":"HiThanks for using healthcare magicI think, you have depressive disorder and you need antidepressant as well as psychotherapy.

Reports have also mentioned that it is also possible to get musical hallucinations from listening to music for long periods of time.Treatment to this condition is largely based on normal hallucination and individual condition.

Since you have mentioned  about masturbation, it seems that you feel your symptoms are due to masturbation. Let me clear some misconceptions first. Masturbation is a completely normal physiological process. Once a person becomes sexually mature, semen production starts which is a continuous process. A person the either has sex, or masturbates and has night falls. Masturbation doesn't lead to any physical or mental health problems. It also doesn't cause any problem with sexual performance, and potency. So you can masturbate without worrying too much. That brings us to the symptoms of impaired concentration and memory .

Paranoid individuals are eager observers. They think they are in danger and look for signs and threats of that danger, potentially not appreciating other evidence.The following can be of use:1.

I suggest you not to worry much. I sincerely suggest that you are doing great. You went through a traumatic and depressive ordeal. For sure. No amount of consolation can equal your fate.

They have duty to do.Secondly, you were doing the same for the last three years. That is great. If you have any mental disorders, you cannot do so. You must add to your self confidence. What you can do now is, understand what life is. Even you are a guest here. Your spouse went because his time had come. When your time comes, you shall also join him. That is life.

As he is able to concentrate on computer games, there is no reason for worry. People with mental problems could not digest computer games.

Some more serious conditions such as tumors or torsion are rare but in doubtful cases, you should do Doppler ultrasound or scintigraphy.

There is some evidence that the medicine clomipramine (an anti-depressant) may help in treating a few people suffering from exploding head syndrome. Some reports also suggest that sedatives can help people suffering from this syndrome. Interestingly, even stimulants are known to have worked for a few.

Is there a way I can stop it from happening?","Doctor":"DearWe understand your concernsI went through your details. I suggest you not to worry much. Nervousness is totally curable.

This happens because they fear the future.But how can you predict future? Future is unpredictable. Can Yesterdays happening repeat tomorrow? I do not think so. But here you are fearing that it may happen. You also fear that your hands tremble when you hold something. Then that happens.Positive imagination is one cure. Close your eyes.

The medications that you have mentioned are etizola plus which is a combination of etizolam 0.5 mg and escitalopram 10 mg. Etizola .5 contains only Etizolam .5 mg.Etizolam is a benzodiazepine which helps in reducing anxiety. However,  it doesn't reduce the disease process which is causing anxiety and depression. Escitalopram is a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor which helps in the treatment of anxiety as well as depression.Since it is already 20 days of your treatment, I would suggest you revisit your psychiatrist for  a treatment review. Had I been your psychiatrist, I would have increased the dose of escitalopram further and waited for its effect. If still there is no improvement, some other drug like venlafaxine or paroxetine can be tried.I would also be taking care that the dose of etizolam is kept under control and later tapered off to reduce the chances of developing dependency.Hope this information was helpful.

In your case, since you are having depressive and anxiety symptoms again, it will be advisable to start treatment again. Treatment can be of two types: with medications and with psycho-therapeutic methodsIn case your symptoms are mild, option of treatment with psychotherapy like cognitive behavior therapy can be considered if there is a trained therapist in your locality. Alternatively, treatment with escitalopram can be considered. Escitalopram is relatively safe even in pregnancy. The highest risk is usually in the 1st three months which in your case is over. Benzodiazepines should usually be avoided throughout pregnancy. So medicines can be started. You can discuss regarding this with your psychiatrist.In any case, treatment is necessary as depression during pregnancy can cause effects on the unborn baby too.Hope I was able to answer your query.Best wishes."},{"Patient":"sir , i was taking fluxetine 40mg for past six months, but then my doctor change it to 10 mg b'coz of its side effects( complain by me ) , at present i am on 10 mg fluxetine but  i am NOT FEELING RELAXING , ITS IS JUST LIKE  MY BRAIN IS WORKING 24HRS NON STOP , CONSTANT THOUGHTS , AND TOO MUCH VIVID DREAMS.  sir plz tell me the solution of this thing.","Doctor":"HiThanks for using healthcare magicThe symptoms, which you are getting, may be due to sudden decrease in antidepressant.

I suffer from very severe depression.  I have for a long time, tried suicide.  My father and brother have, and as I understand it, it does tend to run in the family.  The only thing that stops me now, is that I cannot put my son or grandchildren through what I went through.  So, I cannot do that anymore.  I just suffer in deep silence.  I have tried to contact Dr. Phil and Robin for at least four times now for help.  My help is not coming and I cannot even afford to pay you to give me an answer on what to do to get the help I need.  I just spent at least an hour and 1/2 e-mailing Robin again, and it got lost in the system.  I cannot deal with anymore depression and rejection and am basically a hermit.  I do not go out because the money is just not there, and I suffer from extremely low self-esteem and I feel very repulsive to anyone that I meet.  This possibly comes from a very abusive and very lonely childhood and also from an extremely abusive, (mentally, physically, and sexually) marriage of thirty years.  There is absolutely no help where I live.  Basically because I just cannot afford it.  I have been in mental health inpatient many times and know the program forward and backward.  Nothing is helping me anymore.  I am very lonely and have very little human contact.  Besides, I suffer in alot, sometimes severe pain pain and also from \\"broken heart sydrome\\".  I will probably die from it.  I am 67 yrs. old, have been married for thirty years, and divorced for nineteen years.  Ironically, I got a doctor with a last name that sounds like my everyday life.  There is so much more to this story, but will not go into it anymore, seeing that I already e-mail Dr. Phil and Robin for help and did not receive it.  If there is a charge for this service, please do not answer me, as I do not have any money to pay for it.  I am at the library using their computer, because I cannot afford one, as all those other fancy devices out there.  After being divorced for all this time, an attorney who voluteers for the Women's Center, looked over my divorce degree and found some things that I have over-looked.  Now it will be to the point that the ex and/the insurance company will be supeneoned to get the information that we need.  This is also putting extreme anxiety on me, for fear of what he will do to me.  I also do not want my son to stop talking to me.  We have just rebuilt our relationship after a six year split and in that time I did not see my grandchildren.  I just could not bear to go thru that again, and I cannot confide in my son about this, because I fear that he will go and say something to my ex, and trouble will start before it begins.  I know that I have layed alot on you.  This is only the \\"frosting on the cake\\".  Thank you so much for listening to me.  I did not mean to let this e-mail go so long, but this is what happens when I have no one to talk too.Thank you for being there.I probably will not be coming to the library no more.  There is absolutely no sense in it, as no one hears me--they listen, but they do not hear.  Many Blessings.","Doctor":"HiThanks for using healthcare magicI think, you have underline depression and in that case, you need antidepressant that could help to control depressive and anxiety symptoms.

I have only taken pills for it once, two years ago. My mother recently passed away and i have been having the ongoing symptoms of panic (shortness of breath, racing heart, heart feels like its going to flop out of my chest) for the past month. It comes and goes, and i have only had a couple of full blown attacks (hyperventalating, crying, basic melt down) twice. I have had these symptoms before and two years ago when i had them, i took myself to the emergency room again. Once again they said it was just stress and the panic disorder. I asked several times if they were sure my heart was ok and they said yes. So, my question...I am supposed to take my daughter to an amusement park tomorrow, and i suddenly am terrified about going on coasters, because of the way my heart has been latley. So, my hightened anxiety about riding the coasters makes me more nervous and then more paniced. Although i have been told before that there is nothing really wrong with my heart, do you think riding the roller coasters would be dangerous?

I cannot focus my eyes for long on the face of whoever I am talking to. I always feel very concious of where my eyes focus but i really just can t control it.

My officemate superior made hints, remarks although not directly so as excuse himself I m sure that it made me uneasy, annoyed and depressed. I just go along usually by engaging on his insensitive remarks. By then, it became constant and he always try to trap me and then observe my reaction. As a result I became paranoid.

I feel when I talk to another as I try to avoid it so that I will not be suspected, my eyes still wander on material things like cellphone. I now have developed fixation about these things, which is due to overly being sensitive to gossiping and observation by others. My eyes are doing the opposite, my brain says don t look.

Then naturally we become upset, sometime obsessed with the thought, we loose sleep and appetite. Often this happens when love fails or someone close to us departs. That is purely emotional.Within a short span of time, we overcome the emotional problem because, we can't be LIKE THAT always. We have other things to do. We have obligations towards others. In your case also, without any therapy or treatment you shall be alright within a week or so. Just do your duty and obligations towards your loved ones.

Make sure that you are providing him the right family atmosphere at home. Try to be friendly by just listening to him. Never advice if he seems irritated. Children hate advises.

You might benefit from anti-depressants which are safe and effective. You also need to express your emotions out, may be talk to a friend, family member about what you are going through. You can try writing diary daily  for the same. You can also start exercising daily. Relaxation exercises like progressive muscular relaxation will help you relax. You can ask your psychiatrist regarding the same.Hope this information was helpful.

You haven't mentioned whether your mother is on any treatment as of now and what are the exact symptoms she is suffering from as of now.I would advise you to consult a neurologist first. Thorough evaluation with blood investigations, cardiac evaluation and brain scanning would be needed to determine any primary cause of dementia. She would need treatment with medicines like donepizil which will slow down her progressive cognitive decline. In addition, if she is having any behavioral symptoms, medications might be required for that too. She could also be helped by certain behavioral measures for her memory symptoms. You can discuss this with the neurologist.Hope this information was useful.

Areas affected would be feet, legs, groin area, hands, arms, back of neck. It looks like an infection since it is red, swollen, sore but no opening in the skin. I think it may be an auto- immune problem. I ve had this now since I was 30 yr. old and am now 58 yr. old. I thought perhaps it could be Sarcoidosis, however chest x-rays do not show abnormal lesions which is usually found with this disease. Sarcoidosis is however difficult to diagnose. Doctors do not seem overly concerned, but if it is Sarcoidosis, that is something that I understand from some sources can be treated with steroidal type medicine. Or it could be something like Sarcoidosis. I would like to get rid of it permanently even though it manifests itself occasionally. First time I got it, it came on suddenly and affected from the knees down. Red slash marks about 1.5 to 2 inches long by about .5 inch wide turned bluish like a bruise and was raised, warm to the touch and painful but denser in the centre. It went away on its own but took a few months. My feet were both very swollen. I get it periodically, seemingly when I m physically and mentally stressed.

If yes, then you could be suffering from a condition known as Fibromyalgia which is partly Psychiatric & partly Neurological condition.Its exact cause is unknown but any kind of stress, bad eating-sleeping habits etc. are commonly implicated causes. You should visit a Neurologist/Psychiatrist/Rheumatologist for a formal diagnosis of fibromyalgia.

Generally speaking, Lorazepam is a short acting drug of benzodizepine class & gets rapidly cleared from the body in around 24 hours. Hence, sometimes it becomes difficult to wean off a patient (in this case you) from lorazepam particularly when he is taking moderately high doses like 5mg. One of the main strategies employed is addition of longer acting drugs like Dizepam/Clonazepam/Chlordizepoxide of the benzodizepine class just enough to substitute for lorazepams actions & not causing distressing withdrawal symptoms. Under cover of these drugs, lorazepam is gradually stopped. In uncomplicated cases, usually 1-2 weeks time is enough to taper off lorazeapm & as aforementioned drugs are longer acting & self tapering thus lesser chances of addiction with them.

Some therapeutic treatment methods have been found effective in curing all stages of anxiety neurosis. Cognitive therapy and behavioral therapy are the two important types of therapies administered for treatment. These therapies aim to create new thoughts in the patient’s mind, replacing the old, harmful, and damaging thoughts. Your thoughts are the first important aspects to be acted upon, and they need to be restructured during therapy. These therapeutic methods for treating anxiety are considered to be the best and safest at present for any anxiety neurosis and a number of other psychological disorders. Exposure therapy is another type of therapeutic treatment which focuses on familiarizing the patient with the anxiety triggers.Step 1 - Practice Deep and full breathing whenever possibleStep 2 - Drink plenty of water and fruit juices.

Three days of taking medications is not sufficient to comment whether he needs any change in his medication. Clonorest is clonazepam and is given to your husband only for immediate relief in his anxiety. But if it is inducing sleep during the day then the dose can be reduced or even stopped. It is given for reducing anxiety while escitalopram starts showing benefit.

This is usually treated with 10 days of antibiotics, usually ciprofloxacin and there are no permanent consequances. Masturbation and intercourse should be avoided till pain persist, if possible since I may prolong inflammation course. Some more serious conditions such as tumors or torsion are rare but in doubtful cases you should do Doppler ultrasound or scintigraphy.

They will take you down again and the efforts you have put in treatment will get waste.One more thing, if paxil is working for you and you are keeping fine on it, you can try to reduce its dosage instead of skipping the doses.

As a 12-year-old, I babysat my neighbor s kids all the time. They were like family to me. I m a 28 y/o female now. For some reason, a memory was triggered recently. I remember being 12 and while changing the 2-year-old boy s diaper, I touched his penis to see what it felt like for a second. I remember immediately being grossed out. I can only assume that at that age, I was just curious but at the same time, I cannot believe I would think that was an okay decision to make. What on earth? As a side, I ve worked with kids all my life and never recalled this, thought twice about anything or had any weird thoughts like that. Remembering this event is making me feel like a terrible person, as if I m all of a sudden labeling myself and changing my own sense of self. I ve been struggling with this for two weeks now and I m starting to have a difficult time just making it through the day. I m starting to think that this has simply become rumination. Can I really feel guilty for something like that as a 12-year old child?","Doctor":"HIThanks for using healthcare magicWhatever you have done, that is past now and no one could change your past.
