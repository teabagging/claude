Eventhough you have had normal endoscopy and normal ultrasound , the symptoms do suggest that you do have some upper intestinal problems. The mention of greasy foamy stool suggests that you have problem digesting fat. This might happen when your pancreas is not functioning properly. Repeated attacks of inflammation of the pancreas can cause this type of damage and the condition is called \\"Pancreatitis \\". Eventhough the most common cause is gallstones, other conditions can also cause this. This could be alcohol related or viral infections .

Black specs can be Malena(black tarry shiny stools) or clotted blood.She might require an antiboitic course in form of Injection Ceftriaxone or oral Cephalexin or ciplox with Metronidazole. Get her stool test done at the earliest. And hydrate her frequently as she might land up in dehydration. Give her anti-inflammatory in form of paracetamol to relieve fever."},{"Patient":"Hello, My 6 year old daughter came home from school super grumpy, tired and not acting like herself. Not surprisingly, she started running a fever. I am obviously concerned that it is the flu and will take her to the doctor tomorrow morning, but right now she is saying that her eyes hurt, even while blinking. I have no idea why or what to do about it. Any suggestions?","Doctor":"She might be having common cold( flu). Its a viral infection in which child has cough, cold, running nose, fever, headache and conjunctivitis and eye discharge.Hurting of eyes suggests she might be having conjunctivitis. She might even start rubbing her eyes very often and might cause red eyes. Its not a serious condition. Give her Tobramycin eye drops 1 drop each for both eyes 3 to 4 times a day. Also give her symptomatic treatment if form of a cough syrup like Sinarest, Syp crocin for fever and tablet levocetrizine for running nose. She should be alright in 2 to 4 days as a viral infection takes that long to subside."},{"Patient":"Hi my 8 month old baby had a heart murmur and 2 weeks ago he passed away. They still doing testing on him and the last test is a brain one cos he had two seizure when he was born and they want to see if he may have had another one. What are the chances of babies dying cos of heart murmurs and having a seizure?","Doctor":"a child dying of heart murmur suggests that he had a congenital heart disease and he must have gone into Congestive heart failure and succumbed(commonly seen in these conditions). If ECHO was done, that could have explained the type of heart defect in the child. If the child has  Cynotic CHD, in that condition a Hypoxic event can lead to seizures. Children with CHD are prone to sever pneumonias which are difficult to treat and can lead to septicemia and Meningitis, which is another cause of seizures. Apart from these conditons, brain abscess in CCHD or any structural malformation in the brain(Syndromic baby) can also cause seizures."},{"Patient":"I have a 12 YEAR OLD son diagnosed with Pandas Syndrome approx. 4 years ago. Hew neurologist made this diagnosis. He has just recently healed from strep virus. A couple of ticks are now more prominent now. He takes Stratera and Ceterizine for his allergys. Any suggestions on treatment?","Doctor":"Pandas syndrome(Pediatric acute onset neuropsychiatric disorder associated with streptococci) is a neorological disease in form of OCD or ADHD or choreiform disorder. Child is treated according to the behavioural pattern. If he shows more of OCD features, SSRI are the treament given. IF he has ADHD features, he is given Atomexitane. there is currently little role of antibiotics. Your child is getting Straterra(atomexitane) and cetrizine which is absolutely fine for his disorder. Experiments have suggested a good role of Plasmapheresis in such disease for removal of autoantibodies."},{"Patient":"Hi Good morning Dr. I have a 5 month old babba who I ahve to leave teh entire day as I am a working women.

Since I am at work teh whole day consuming teh lactogen milk becomes very expense by the weekly as weekly i have to buy a new packet . but if advised to continue then I will keep him on lactogen .","Doctor":"Hi, exclusive breast feeding till the age of 6 months is a standard guideline. Since you are working woman and not possible for you to do so, you can start the child on Amul tetrapack milk. But its absolutely not advised to dilute the milk before giving. That will affect the childs nutrition and health. Also take care that you give him in clean and washed equpments as the chances of bacterial diarrhoea is very high with use of packaged milk. Also boil the milk, let it cool down and then give your child to drink."},{"Patient":"My 11 month old lo is having loose motion since Thursday , till satr hez was fine dr had told to give sporloc powder and z and d drop but again from satrday motion started yelloeish white creamy consistancy, I m jst worried dat what shd I give him to eat as dr tokd no sugar shd be givn.","Doctor":"Child of 11 month age usually has a rotaviral diarrhoeal infection. This infection takes 5 to 7 days to settle in. An antibiotic cover in form of Sporidex drops takes care of any bacterial infection.Give your child Syrup Zincolife 5 ml once daily for 14 days. Give her cereals, porriage and mashed banana to eat. Keep a watch on her hydration and give Oral rehydration salt(ORS) 1 packet in 1 litre of water every 24 hours by spoon 10 to 12 sips every 30 minutes and for every loose stool."},{"Patient":"Hello, I was recently in the ER for abdomial pain. I have an infection somewhere, high white blood cells count and a thickening was found in a cat scan of my ileum? Can you tell me what this could mean? I have a GI appointment scheduled for next friday, but my mind is racing. I am 29 years old, mother of 3, and need answers. I left the ER with no explanation or diagnosis, just two antibotics.","Doctor":"Hi  kayla.amoroso. Thanks for your question. Your diagnosis is very simple.You had pain abdomen with white blood cell count increase and CT SCAN showed thickening in illeum.It is probably a case on ilial or intestinal tuberculosis.There are other rare possibilities too-it can be a crohns colitis,malignancy involving ileum,volvulus or just infection of ileum but this causes are very rare. But i am thinking why you have pain.Probably this causes sub acute intestinal obstruction so you have pain. So continue taking antibiotics,taking a laxative as you need regular stool pass,take plenty of water with salt as in this cases chance of dyselectrolytimeia is high.Please do a straight xray abdomen to see any evidence of obstruction or perforation. If your pain subsided,passed stool,urine,become stable then you can leave in your house otherwise best to keep yourself admitted in any hospital/nursing home as in your cases sudden intestinal obstruction can occur and that is a dreadful complication. Consult gastrosurgeon on Friday and follow his advise.

In your case, pneumonia in neonates is a serious condition. It requires usually 7 to 10 days of I.V. antibiotics with oxygen supplementation. If the child has been put on a ventilator machine, that suggests a very poor prognosis for the child. The child will require a good nursery care with heavy anibiotics(according to culture sensitivity if positive) in form of Injection Meropenem, Vancomycin or any third generation Cephalosporin.

Stomach pain due to associated gastritis is quite common in certain viral illnesses. For stomach pain you can ask him to chew one Gelusil tablet now and another one immediately to be put in the mouth like a chocolate. Fever of few days without any localizing signs could as well a viral illness. Usually rather than fever, what is more important is the activity of the child, in between 2 fever episodes on the same day. If the kid is active and playing around when there is no fever, it is probably viral illness and it doesn't require antibiotics at all. Once viral fever comes it will there for 4-7 days. So do not worry about duration if the kid is active.Regards - Dr. Sumanth"},{"Patient":"My baby is 6 months now. Want to stop breast feeding gradually. Introduced lactogen 2. Baby nvr liked th taste.

He threw up the same amount of nan pro he consumed.","Doctor":"Hi...there is no specific reason why some kids throw up some specific formula feeds. But if your kid is growing well on breast feeds, as it is 6 months now, I suggest, you continue breast feeds for milk requirement and start solid feeds like rice based feeds. Other home-made food options will be - 1. Daal and rice well cooked and made into a porridge along with ghee2. Boiled apple or banana and mashed into a paste.3. Any made cereal porridge preparation with additional ghee added.Remember certain principles like -1. Add one food material / cereal or fruit per week. This will be useful because if he develops vomiting or diarrhoea, we will know what to avoid.2. Add vegetables and fruits made into a paste surely to avoid constipation.3.

Last night whilst in bed I was suddenly hit by an excruciating pain in my lower abdomen . The pain was sharp and intense, I felt sick, and very faint. The pain was this intense for an hour and a half, I managed to control the pain by sitting on the edge of the bed with my chest on my knees. It didn t feel like a general stomach ache as I often get these, and definitely not a UTI as again, I have had these quite severely. I was quite scared as I ve never felt pain like it, but I managed to fall asleep eventually. This morning, my stomach feels bloated and tender, hurts to press, walk or sit. I am not pregnant either. Any ideas?","Doctor":"Hi, Thanks for  your query. Very hard to put diagnosis just from few symptoms/signs. I noted you have had previously gastric disturbances and UTI. If your pain are correlated with previously condition or not need to be determine by properly check up to rule out above mentioned conditions. You must thinking also about premenstrual syndrome that often appear with intense pain, cramps. However, I will advice you now at this stage abdominal ultrasound, blood work, urine analysis and Gynecologist consultation. Take care and if you have additional queries I  will be glad answer  you."},{"Patient":"My 3 year old grandchild ate about 30 chewable tylenol tablets she was taken to the E.R. and parents were told they had to wait four hrs to have the levels tested.

If I were the paediatrician treating the kid, I would admit her and observe her for 24 hours for jaundice and also get an liver function testing done along with prothrombin time (PT). PT is very important for classification of toxicity and if it is prolonged she might be given a dose of Vitamin K injection too.regards - Dr. Sumanth"},{"Patient":"my 8 month old has a consistent temp of 104 since last night. tylenol and ibuprofen bring it down for a couple of hours, but it goes back up. his hands and feet are very cold and slightly blue and swollen. his body is speckled - as when one is cold. he is very lethargic; fussy and not sleeping well.

I do have albutetol treatments but he fights me so much when I try to give them to him that he doesn t get much of the treatment. Thanks Hilary","Doctor":"Hi...Prednisolone is a prescription medicine and not to be used in single aliquots. Its a course and if the dose and course is prolonged it requires gradual tapering doses too. I do not suggest giving him Prednisolone for barking cough. Metered dose inhalers are the best for wheezy cough. But if its a dry braking cough you can try some over the counter cough medication licensed for use at this age in your country.Regards - Dr. Sumanth"},{"Patient":"My son is 12yrs old.

The school has no idea what it is.","Doctor":"Hi...by what you quote I feel this could be a hand foot mouth disease epidemic going on in the school. This is one viral illness among all other exanthemas which can cause fever followed by rash over palms and soles. It is a self-limiting disorder and itching can be really worrisome. I suggest you use any over the counter antihistamine if you have one with you now. You can use Hydroxyzine at 1-2mg/kg/dose (Maximum 10mg) every 6th to 8th hourly for 7 days. This can even cause some peeling of skin in the next 4-6 weeks and do not worry about it.Regards - Dr. Sumanth"},{"Patient":"My 13 year old son sleeps 20 plus hours per day and exhausted when he is awake.

Paracetamol can be given in the dose of 15mg/kg/dose every 4-6th hourly, that too only if fever is more than 100F. I suggest not using combination medicines for fever, especially with Paracetamol.For cold you can use Cetrizine at 0.25mg/kg/dose every 12 hourly for 3 days.For nasal block, plain saline nasal drops will do, every 4-6th hourly to relive nasal congestion.Regards - Dr. Sumanth"},{"Patient":"my wife is experiencing upper stomach pain for the second time in this week.After the first we went to a doc and he prescribed megaldrate simithicone and oxithazine.

We had started some solid foods and had been doing rice cereal with milk a couple weeks prior to that. She started to lose weight, and had started to get dehydrated.

If she has only symptoms limited to eye and lips, I would suggest her to take an antihistamine like hydroxyzine or diphenhydramine. 2. However, if symptoms progress, then there is a risk that she might have swelling in throat and airways, and in that case she might have difficulty in breathing too.So were I treating her, I would suggest you to give her above suggested antihistamine at home and then take her to nearby hospital so further treatment can be done in case her swelling progresses beyond throat. In that case, she might require some injections and steroids also.3. In future, I would suggest her to avoid eating walnut as well as any product that contains walnut until her allergy to walnut is confirmed or ruled out by an Allergist-Immunologist.Hope above suggestions will be helpful to you.Should you have any further query, please feel free to ask at HCM.Wish your daughter the best of the health ahead and a very good recovery.Thank you & Regards."},{"Patient":"My 5 year old son went to his pediatrician on Monday and was sent home with A \\"bad cold and cough\\" diagnosis.

Earlier I noticed he was breathing a little quickly, should we go back to the ped tonight or am I worrying too much?","Doctor":"Hello,Thank you for asking at HCM.I went through your history and would like to make suggestions for your son as follows:1. Generally speaking, there are three main causes of difficulty breathing in a child with \\"bad cold & cough\\" at this age: obstructed nose, wheezing (airway constriction), progression to pneumonia - treatment of both of them is entirely different and only a doctor can identify the cause by examining the child.2. Of course, Mucinex cannot cause such symptoms, so please continue the medicines prescribed by the doctor. But were I treating your son, I would suggest him to get examined by the pediatrician so he can identify the cause of breathing difficulty and treat accordingly. It may be simply a more severe cough-cold or may be progression of the disorder/infection itself to airways/lungs. 3. As the treatment of all three possibility is very different, I would suggest you to get your son examined by nearby pediatrician.Hope above suggestions will be helpful to you.Should you have any further query, please feel free to ask at HCM.Wish your son the best of the health ahead and a very good recovery.Thank you & Regards."},{"Patient":"My son is 2 years old..he has cough and cold from last month..this is for the third time..the doctor has put him on antibiotics..amoxycilin and anti allergy ..levocitrizen..with budesal respules...can levolin be also given..1 respule(2.5 ml) with 2 ml saline solution..what should be given for cough...","Doctor":"Hello,Thank you for asking at HCM.I went through your son's history and would like to make suggestions for him as follows:1.

So I will suggest you to get him examined by doctor and use appropriate cough syrup as suggested by doctor.3.

If you reside in a High Tubercular endemic region, get a chest Xray and mantoux test done .Also its time to step up to higher antibiotics like augmentin or Cephalexin.

To reduce its side effects, ask the child to rinse her mouth after its use with swish and spit technique. Usually all sterois can cause acute gastritis and vomiting but the chances with ICS is rare.

Is this behavior OK ?","Doctor":"Hello,what's more important is that this behavior is inevitable. It's in the nature of children to \\"taste\\" things. Infants feel the world with their mouths! Tasting surfaces that other hands have touched, exposes the baby to risk for infections (respiratory mostly). Germs seem to be good for babies because they lessen the risk for allergies etc.I don't believe there is a definite answer for your question but my personal opinion is that infants should come into contact with the environment and allow them to taste toys etc that have fallen into the ground but there are some limits that should not be exceeded. I wouldn't advice giving to the baby a toy that has visible dirt on it or touching something that a diseased person has touched. There is no need for a diarrheal disease or for a respiratory tract infection. Please also note that the most commonly acquired infections are mild and self-limiting but you can't exclude serious life-threatening infection like tuberculosis for example.

An active is a well kid even if she/ he is not eating well. 2. Development of a kid is as important as or I would say even more important than growth alone.3. As the kids grow their interest in food decreases and interest in play activities increases so that they eat small quantity and run away to play. As parents we need to be more patient and feed than less quantity but more aliquots per day.4. This age rather than the quantity of the food I suggest you concentrate more on the number of times you feed her and also make whatever you feed her calorie dense by adding good amount of ghee to it.5. I suggest you not to use appetite stimulants on long run as they may cause drowsiness.Regarding the charts - I suggest you use WHO growth charts which are freely downloadable from the net.Regards - Dr. Sumanth"},{"Patient":"My one year old consistently has a loose yellow stool. 2times a day, occasionally 3.

Today i have given her 4 Doses of Crocin 8ml each but fever stays.Is it safe to keep her only on Crocin Ds any further?

Paracetamol can be given in the dose of 15mg/kg/dose every 4-6th hourly that too only if fever is more than 100F. I suggest not using combination medicines for fever, especially with Paracetamol.Fever of few days without any localizing signs could as well a viral illness. Usually rather than fever, what is more important is the activity of the child, in between 2 fever episodes on the same day. If the kid is active and playing around when there is no fever, it is probably viral illness and it doesn't require antibiotics at all. Once viral fever comes it will there for 4-7 days. So do not worry about duration if the kid is active.Regards - Dr. Sumanth"},{"Patient":"Hi my name is susan and im 32 years old.I am in cyprus now and i ve been feeling uneasyness on the left part of my abdomain near heart for some days.It is because of the wrong style of sleepiness or something else?so would you please tell me what could be the reason and what should be done to get rid of this problem?I would be appreciate to know the answer.

I will give an explanation why so...This is called evening colic and is quite common in this age group. This happens when the baby sucks at the breast very fast and in eagerness to drink milk will gulp in air too. Unless the air comes out like burping or flatus this discomfort will be there.Next time check if she is sucking too fast and gulping in air too. You will be more convinced.Usually I don't advice any medicines for this as they give only temporary relief.The two best ways to relieve this distress is - 1. Do not put her in lying position after feeding till she burps out the swallowed air.2. If she is still crying - put her in prone position and keep patting her back gently so that she passes off the flatus and gets relieved.Regards - Dr. Sumanth"},{"Patient":"My son aged 14 years is underweight of only 28kgs only and short for his age, skinny as well.

Sometimes the symptoms of Migraine can be very non-specific like this. If there is a family history of migraine, all the more the probability increases.

Can anyone help to explain please?","Doctor":"Hi, . Your X-ray is grossly normal.  Simple explanation of the report is as follows 1. The shape and size of kidney cannot be commented as the bowels adjacent and in front of it are obscuring it. This can happen when one is constipated and the bowel is distended by stool and gas. However it is clear that there are no stones noted in the kidney. 2. There are a small calcifications noted in a few of veins in the pelvis. Such calcified vein spots are described as phlebolith. These phleboliths are harmless condition and doesn't need any treatment. The bottom line is your abdominal X-ray is normal and does not explain the right abdominal pain that you have.

You have severe stomach pain with vomiting so high probability you have any stomach pathology-most commonly peptic ulcer disease,gastritis,may be pyloric stenosis due to mass or ulcer in the pylorus and rarely due to hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy(common in children),may be a stomach volvulus or atrophic gastritis.So please do a upper GI endoscopy,barium xray and  USG whole abdomen must and as early as possible .depending on the report you may need a biopsy if a mass is detected and then consult a gastrosurgeon or general surgeon for his opinion. best wishes, Dr Sourav Ganguly"},{"Patient":"I recently gained custody of my fiancée 20 month old grand son.i am concerned that he may have FAS.

If you were given pain medications, it is possible that you might be experiencing some side effects. After any type of intestinal surgery, the contractions of the intestines are a little slow and this might account for the bloating. Also, Donnatal slows down the contractions. If the pain persists, I would recommend contacting the surgeon who may recommend some x-rays or scans.

If your son has nose symptoms also, I would add levocetirizine to his treatment also.I also suggest them to use salbutamol inhaler on as-and-when-needed basis.2. Please make sure your technique of using inhaler is correct. At this age, metered dose inhaler with spacer device with mask is a good option to use. However, the technique is equally important, so please review your technique of using the inhaler by your pediatrician/pulmonologist/allergist.3. I would also suggest your son allergy testing for common air-borne allergens like house dust mites, molds, pollens, insect proteins, pet dander (if you have pet). This will help you identify the substances causing allergies to your son as well as to know the measures to avoid them.4. In general, I would suggest him to avoid exposure to dusts, smokes and air pollution as much as possible.5. I would like to mention here that childhood asthma needs long term treatment (sometimes for months and sometimes for years also).

Regards . Rekha","Doctor":"Hello, Welcome to HCM,I understand your concern.Bed wetting at the age to 13 years is not normal and we have to do something for that.You should start with home measures initially.Ask your son not to drink fluid, water, caffeine containing drinks like cocacola, thumpsup, pepsi, tea, coffee two hours before going to sleep. Ask your son to empty bladder before going to bed.Some children exhibit some sign just before wetting the bed like restlessness. If you pick up this sign during night, wake up him and take him for bathroom.Never scold your son for wetting the bed. Bed wetting may be a sign if the child feels emotion or social insecure. Take your child in your confidence. Tell him that bed wetting is not good and you are going to help him get rid of this.During day time, ask your son to hold urine as long as he can and than go and empty bladder. This kind of \\"bladder exercise\\" will enable him to control bladder.Try these measures for 2-3 months. If they are working, go ahead with them.If they don't work, You should consult psychiatrist or pediatrician. Medicines are available for bed wetting like Imipramine & desmopressine and they are highly effective but they can only be prescribed by a doctor.I hope this will helpful.All the best."},{"Patient":"Hi, my 2 year old son had ear tubes a year ago and recently had an ear infection with lots of ear drainage which was treated with antibiotics.

I thought it just only pain because of my monthly period is coming soon..Ussually I experienced stomache cramp if my period is coming..but it nver gets big..","Doctor":"Hi, . Abdominal pain and distended abdomen are not related to each other unless there is intestinal obstruction. Pregnancy is another instance but the distension is gradual and slow. As per your description, the right lower back pain is most likely related to renal stone or related to menstruation and the abdominal distension is probably an incidental occurrence. Are you constipated? Is there any inability to pass stool? - If the answer is yes, then intestinal obstruction needs to be ruled out. My suggestions that can help you are: 1. Monitor the progress of symptoms. 2. You may take over the counter analgesics for pain relief. 3. Drink plenty of water. 4. Visit your doctor if the symptoms get worse or if you have bowel disturbance as mentioned above. Hope this helps.

At her age interest in play increases and interest in food decreases. This is quite natural. If she is active and playing around you need not worry.

There are many possible causes for breathing problems in children. They can be as simple as allergic rhinitis or anemia or more serious such as asthma or other lung/heart disorders.2. As your daughter's previous health is almost good, please do not think of any serious cause at present. Please follow a step by step approach for identifying the cause.3. Were I treating her, I would take her history of symptoms in great details which would guide me towards possible diagnosis. 4. In general, I would suggest complete blood counts with ESR. If she has repeated/longstanding nose symptoms, I would treat her for allergic rhinitis with antihistamines & montelukast. If her symptoms are suggestive of asthma, I would suggest her spirometry/PEFR testing and would treat accordingly. If she does not have any of above, I would advise chest X ray and also would think of stress-related causes such as anxiety, etc.Hope above suggestions will be helpful to you.Should you have any further query, please feel free to ask at HCM.Wish your daughter the best of the health ahead.Thank you & Regards."},{"Patient":"I went to the ER last night because of abdominal pain with distention and vomitting.

I would advise you the following:Investigations first as treatment can cause more problems if the diagnosis has not been done. -X-ray of the abdomen in standing position.-CT scan of the abdomen to understand the pathology. -Once clinical evaluation is done, cleaning of the colon by enema, oral peglac like osmotic cathartic and then colonoscopy.-Barium studies if no acute obstruction-Once the diagnosis has been made, the treatment can be planned according to the findings and can be a surgery."},{"Patient":"My husband has been having severe stomach cramps and has dark orange urine .

Though most of the times the pain is tolerable.But there were times that the pain is too much for a least a minute like i am having a dysmenorrhea or like i m going to have bowel movement . Also, when i am about to fart , there is so much pain before it releases. Also, i feel the pain mostly when I am standing. Based on my usual menstruation cycle i will have my menstruation period most probably in july 2nd or 4th. Does carrying heavy objects, just the other day, than I usually do may cause this cramps?

Dark puffiness below the eyes is often a sign of environemental allergy. If it comes with no other symptoms, I just observe without treatment. If there are symptoms, however, there are oral medications and nose sprays that can be used. If the pain she is experiencing is severe, I would consider it. if not, you can give it time to resolve on it's own.

From what you are describing, the complaints right after he eats or drinks something is indicative for possible problems related to his GI tract including:- bowel infection: culture of stool and examination of stool for ova/parasites are advised- food intolerance- gastritis/acid reflux: upper endoscopy to be considered.

She does not have a temperature and has been like this the past 4 days. She has not had a bowel movement the past 5 days either. I ve heard some breastfed babies don t have a bowel movement for up to 10 days. I do give her about 2 oz of apple juice mixed with water throughout the day through a dropper.

This happens when the baby sucks at the breast very fast and in eagerness to drink milk will gulp in air too. Unless the air comes out like burping or flatus this discomfort will be there and next time check if she is sucking too fast and gulping in air too. You will be more convinced. Usually I don't advice any medicines for this as they give only temporary relief.The two best ways to relieve this distress is - 1. Do not put her in lying position after feeding till she burps out the swallowed air.2. If she is still crying - put her in prone position and keep patting her back gently so that she passes off the flatus and gets relieved.Regards - Dr. Sumanth"},{"Patient":"Hi, my son is 5 days old.

Since today evening my daughter who is very close with me, has been developing fever, and hence the medicines. Pls advise what would be the best way forward on my daughter s health.","Doctor":"HI...if your daughter is developing fever in being in contact with you, then it is not malaria and mostly it is viral illness. Viral illness spreads by close contact and malaria spreads by mosquito bites.Now in south India, Dengue is in full swing. I do not recommend the usage of Meftal-P which has the side effect of dropping platelet counts, because as such in any viral illness, there can be drop in platelet counts.Fever of few days without any localizing signs could as well a viral illness. Usually rather than fever, what is more important is the activity of the child, in between 2 fever episodes on the same day. If the kid is active and playing around when there is no fever, it is probably viral illness and it doesn't require antibiotics at all. Once viral fever comes it will there for 4-7 days. So do not worry about duration if the kid is active.Paracetamol can be given in the dose of 15mg/kg/dose every 4-6th hourly that too only if fever is more than 100F. I suggest not using combination medicines for fever, especially with Paracetamol.Regards - Dr. Sumanth"},{"Patient":"My one month old daughter has lymphangioma and a red birthmark-like on the site of the swelling.

The past two days he has had no energy and very lethargic (doesn t want to play, doesn t do his normal smile and instead buries his head on my shoulder when he would normally smile). He almost sounds like he has laryngitis. He has two older siblings in preschool who could easily have brought germs home. What does this sound like to you? Do I need to go to a Dr tomorrow or to the Emergency Room tonight?","Doctor":"Hi...this seems like a acute laryngotracheobronchitis or commonly called croup...usually it is viral in origin. You can see the doctor tomorrow and as much as possible keep him comfortable and do not make him cry. if he develops stridor, then you need to take him to the nearest emergency room immediately.Regards - Dr. Sumanth"},{"Patient":"My daughter just turned one, her poo is very snotty and sometimes has a little blood in it. Her poo was tested for any infections but they said nothing was wrong. I breastfed her until about 7 months then she was on soy formula, it seemed to be fine after that so i thought it was an allergy with my breastmilk. Now shes on whole milk and it started again. I told her doctor and he acted like its normal. I said should i switch her to soy milk and he said no. Ok so im clueless on whats going on. Please help.","Doctor":"HI...by what you quote there are two possibilities here - 1. Cows milk protein allergy - uncommon at this age.2. Acute bacillary dysentery - common at this age.My suggestion - Stop all cow's milk products and go lactose free in her diet and in 1 week you see any difference - that means it confirms the diagnosis of cow's milk protein allergy and you need to re-administer cow's milk products after 3 more months and see again.Regards - Dr. Sumanth"},{"Patient":"Hi my 4 yr old toe nails are falling off. They are not sore, they are not infected looking. They are very light as in the toe nail when it came off was like paper. The two big toes have already fallen off and it is happening to more. There are toe nails already growing back to replace the ones that have already fallen off.","Doctor":"Hi...this can happen in some ectodermal dysplasias and also certain other chronic skin diseases.

Though the nails are growing back, we need to evaluate why they have fallen off in the first instance.Regards - Dr. Sumanth"},{"Patient":"my grand daughter has a staff infection on her butt from a stay at the hospital...she was over for a visit and helped prepare a meal..we didn t know it was contagious until we looked it up on google..she put the biscuits on the pan for me when preparing the meal.. my question is ;;are we at risk contacting the staff infection?the biscuits were baked,,,also we exchanged good by hugs...","Doctor":"HI...staphylococcal infection can spread and in hospitals usually if it is suspected, contact isolation is advised. The risk of staphylococcal infection is definitely there. But as she has got it now, the best way would be to go about with a oral antibiotic course of Clindamycin.Topical ointment like Mupirocin will also help.Regards - Dr. Sumanth"},{"Patient":"My 14 year old daughter has a bruise on the top of both of her feet, across the knuckles of her 2nd & 3rd toes.

Should we be concerned about the odd matching bruises?","Doctor":"Hi...matching bruises are odd...I agree. But we need to investigate for bleeding disorder if the bruising is due to a very trivial injury. Other possibility is that it could be a pressure induced discoloration of skin.Regards  - Dr. Sumanth"},{"Patient":"hi doctor, i have read in many websites that Cough and cold medicines should not be given to children under 6 years of age. my son is 2.5 yrs old and suffering from runny nose for past 2 weeks with fever coming once in while. i treated with paracetamol whenever fever came. doctor prescribed allegra , ascoril ls and calpol for him.

I just read through your question. Firstly, if she is able to touch her chin to her chest, she does not have meningitis.There are 2 possible reasons why a child will have fever while on antibiotic. First, this may be a bacterial infection the requires a different or stronger antibiotic than Amoxicillin.  Second, there may be a viral infection accompanying the bacterial infection that is not susceptible to antibiotics. this time of year, when I hear fever, respiratory symptoms, and muscle ache, I think about Flu. Not that this is necessarily the diagnosis, but viral infections should be considered.I recommend consulting with your doctor so the correct diagnosis can be made and the appropriate treatment plan implemented."},{"Patient":"Hi my daughter is 6 months old she is having viral from last 6 days.

What is more important is the activity of the kid in between 2 episodes on same day. If she is active in between 2 fever spikes, you need not worry.Paracetamol can be given in the dose of 15mg/kg/dose every 4-6th hourly that too only if fever is more than 100F.

I have been told the ulcers are now healed but I have been having SEVERE pain in my lower central abdomen, the navel and another spot about 2 inches down. It comes and goes in severity but is pretty much a constant source of pain. The pain is a stabbing sensation that gets worse after I eat and when in certain positions such as laying down.

Rajnish, The location of the pain suggests two or three different possibilities. If the pain is related to your intake of meals and is also associated with nausea or voimiting, stomach problems such as ulcer or some form of inflammation of the lining of the stomach called Gastritis is a possibility. If the pain follows after eating some fatty food, then you have to think about gallbladder problem. I suggest you undergo an upper G.I. series (X-ray studies) and also have a sonogram of your gallbladder to see if you have gallstones. Good luck !"},{"Patient":"My 10 yr old virgin daughter has a real strong foul odor coming from her vag and we tried over the counter items like summers eve wash and deep scrubbin. But no change and we fear it will get worse once she gets her monthlys we been fighting this persistent problem for years but every time we seem to have it licked it comes back in full strength pls help","Doctor":"Hi, I have gone through the medical problems of your daughter carefully and understood your concerns. 1. Urinary tract infection can be a possible cause. Get her urine checked by urine analysis and urine culture and sensitivity testing. 2. Be sure she is still virgin: consult with gynecologist to make sure she did not have forced sexual intercourse.3. Vaginal yeast infections are also to blame. Vaginal swab testing can rule it out. Bare in mind not to go deeper in vagina for vaginal swab testing. 4. Intestinal parasitic infections can be another cause. Examination of stool for ova/parasites is highly recommended. For the moment, I highly advise to:- keep a good hygiene of her genitalia- avoid foods/drinks rich in carbohydrates and caloriesAll the best!Dr.Albana"},{"Patient":"My 6 month old grandson is just starting to sit up. He was sitting on a sectional next to me. I got up to turn around and pick him up and when I did, me getting up made him lose his balance and he rolled off of sectional to floor where there was tile floor and area rug. It was about 18 inches. I tried to catch him but did not. He cried for a few minutes but then was fine. I think mainly it scared him cause I gasped when I saw him falling. I do not think he hit is head just his body and he rolled. We looked him over from head to toe and there was not a scratch or bruise on him. This happened 48 hrs ago. He slept well like always the first night but last night he was up and down some but this morning played and laughed just still a little irritable. He also had his 6 months shots the day before and the doctor told him he was starting to teeth. My mother and father in law said that everything is ok and that babies do this all the time. It made me feel so bad. Can you calm my nerves on this one.","Doctor":"Hello. I just read through your question. I hear this story 2-3 times per week. It is very common and you should not worry or feel guilty. At this point, enough time has passed since the fall that we can be reassured that no injury occurred.

She was scratching it earlier today and then when I was helping her put her pj s on I saw it was a big perfectly round raised circle, slightly red in color. What could this be?","Doctor":"Hello. I just read through your question. This is either a reaction to something she came in contact with, or a skin infection. Infections are usually slightly painful when touched or pressed and require antibiotic treatment. Reactions usually resolve on their own. In either case, if the diameter of the circle increases, I recommend consulting with your doctor so the correct diagnosis can be made and the appropriate treatment plan implemented."},{"Patient":"my daughter has had a fever of 101-103 since she was sent home from school this afternoon.

Any ideas?","Doctor":"Hi...Fever of few days without any localizing signs could as well a viral illness. Usually rather than fever, what is more important is the activity of the child, in between 2 fever episodes on the same day. If the kid is active and playing around when there is no fever, it is probably viral illness and it doesn't require antibiotics at all. Once viral fever comes it will there for 4-7 days. So do not worry about duration if the kid is active.This occasional pain abdomen too could be because of this innocuous viral illness itself.Regards - DR.

What s wrong?","Doctor":"HI...a newborn baby will consume more and sleep well because it he only activity they know. As the age increases the baby's activity increases and play interest increases. At this age interest in play increases and interest in food decreases. This is quite natural. If she is active and playing her usual self... you need not worry.

My 3 1/2 year old has been drinking milk her entire life without issue...but since she started drinking this, she has broken out in a red rash on her face and arm.  The rash on her arm went away fairly quickly, but the rash on her face still persists.  It did get better overnight, but when she drank more chocolate milk, it became worse again.  It doesn't seem to bother her at all, but it is dry and red.  If she has no other issues with milk, can she be allergic to something in the chocolate milk (she has had chocolate syrup in milk many times with no issues either).  This is the only think we have changed in our daily routine.  Thank you so much!","Doctor":"Hello,Thank you for asking at HCM.I went through your history and would like to make suggestions for your daughter as follows:1. From your history, I would first think of allergic reaction to some substance within the organic chocolate milk. However, it is difficult to determine exactly which component within the chocolate milk as there are so many constituents including milk, chocolate, cocoa, sweeteners, preservatives, coloring agents, etc etc.2. I usually suggest my such patients to stop consuming the thing that caused allergic reaction and taking an antihistamine like hydroxyzine or cetirizine would control itching and rash.Hope above suggestions will be helpful to you.Should you have any further query, please feel free to ask at HCM.Wish your daughter the best of the health ahead.Thank you & Regards."},{"Patient":"My 11 year old will be 12 next month is complaining today of pain in his right testicle after his bath today.

Is this a sign of puberty or something serious?","Doctor":"Hello.I just read through your question. though many cases of testicular pain turn out to be nothing serious, the pain can sometimes be due to torsion of the testicle.

An active is a well kid even if she/ he is not eating well. 2. Development of a kid is as important as or I would say even more important than growth alone.3. As the kids grow their interest in food decreases and interest in play activities increases so that they eat small quantity and run away to play.

Enlarged tonsils in this age is quite normal and as such viral illness can also be normal in this age.I will tell you certain facts about viral illness - Fever of few days without any localizing signs could as well a viral illness. Usually rather than fever, what is more important is the activity of the child, in between 2 fever episodes on the same day. If the kid is active and playing around when there is no fever, it is probably viral illness and it doesn't require antibiotics at all. Once viral fever comes it will there for 4-7 days.

If the vomiting is forceful, projectile and increasing, then you have to consult a child specialist as we have to rule out a stomach disease called as congenital hypertrophic pyloric stenosis. If the vomiting is not projectile and occasional then you have nothing to worry about. If the baby is sweating it is because of high body temperature of baby. You can try to keep the baby in light clothes and keep the room at cooler temperature. If still the baby is sweating check the temperature of your baby. If it is more than 98.6 F then take him to a child specialist for check up.Hope that answers your question.Regards, Dr.Imaad."},{"Patient":"My 6.5 year old son s ear drum bursted open yesterday and I was wondering if being in a hot tub could cause it? My sister noticed my son looked like he was going to faint, and quickly grabbed him out of the hot tub. He took a break for about 5 minutes, then went swimming in a regular pool for 2 hours.","Doctor":"Welcome to healthcaremagic,Bursting of ear drum could be to many causes but in children it is commonly due to ear infection called as otitis media with effusion. Many times this ear infection is a result of previous common cold or throat infection. I recommend you to take your son to a ENT specialist who can examine the ear and will give appropriate treatment. Hope that answers your question.Regards, Dr.Imaad."},{"Patient":"My 1 month old was born with hypotonia and slept alot even for a newborn. Now she will wake to be fed most of the feedings but still has a time daily where she goes into a deep sleep and nothing will wake her. She sleeps 5-6 hours so she skips 1 feeding. Any idea what would make her so hard to awaken?","Doctor":"Hello. I just read through your question. The most important thing is the baby's weight. If she is gaining appropriate weight then sleeping for 5-6 hours is ok. There is no need to wake her if the weight gain is appropriate. I recommend consulting with your doctor to make sure her weight gain is normal so that she may be allowed to sleep."},{"Patient":"My 10 month old has been having very loose kind of yellow almost like cottage cheese sour smelling poops for the past week. We had started him on homo milk two weeks ago after he had a case of diarrhea. A few days later our whole family got the 24 hour stomach bug and he threw up twice the one day and again the next day and had non stop diarrhea after that for 3 days we had him on pedialite for four days and the diarrhea never stopped so we put him back on formula. Since then he's only had these loose sour smelling poops.","Doctor":"Hello. I just read through your question. It seems he may have picked up the stomach bug the rest of the family had. I agree with what you did, and I also agree about putting him back on the formula. The most important thing is to make sure he stays well hydrated. If he is producing 1-2 wet diapers per 24 hour period, you know he is. Otherwise, as long as he is comfortable, you may continue with the current diet. The diarrhea will resolve on it's own within a few days."},{"Patient":"My 11 month old son had some red blotchiness on his torso and back of his neck yesterday that seems to have spread to his arms and legs now and up his face. What could be causing this? He doesn t have a fever and it doesn t seem to be itchy. How long do I wait to see if it just goes away?","Doctor":"Hello. I just read through your question. This is either a harmless viral rash, or a reaction to something.  Following it's course over the next 2-3 days is sufficient. If it continues to spread, you should consult your doctor. If not, you can leave it be.

I take this opportunity to tell you certain scientific facts and relieve your distress - An active is a well kid even if she/ he is not eating well. Development of a kid is as important as or I would say even more important than growth alone. As the kids grow their interest in food decreases and interest in play activities increases so that they eat small quantity and run away to play. As parents we need to be more patient and feed than less quantity but more aliquots per day. This age rather than the quantity of the food I suggest you concentrate more on the number of times you feed her and also make whatever you feed her calorie dense by adding good amount of ghee to it. I suggest you not to use appetite stimulants on long run as they may cause drowsiness.Regards - Dr. Sumanth"},{"Patient":"my kid is 4.5 yrs old and having fever for past 2 to 3 weeks but not continuously in between 1 week he was fine and now he got cold and fever temperature s 99.8 and i took typhoid test malaria test and urine culture and everything s normal and my son is active and he is very under weight 13 kg.","Doctor":"Hi...Fever of few days without any localizing signs could as well a viral illness. Usually rather than fever, what is more important is the activity of the child, in between 2 fever episodes on the same day.

So do not worry about duration if the kid is active.Paracetamol can be given in the dose of 15mg/kg/dose every 4-6th hourly that too only if fever is more than 100F.

Is there any family history of asthma or any other sort of allergies like skin allergy etc.?6.

Physical examination , including palpitation of the RLQ produced increasing pain. Dr. Ordered labs drawn - WBC was elevated, potassium was slightly low. Ultrasound was ordered for the following day, as well as 500mg amoxacillin tid. Ultrasound of lower and upper abdomen showed irregular heterogenous area in upper aspect of the right lobe of the liver of mixed echogenicity. Suggested atypical pattern of fatty infiltration, or atypical hemangioma . Recommended CT scan of abdomen and pelvis to evaluate the liver. CT scan showed fatty liver with area of enhancement in the lateral aspect of the right lobe of the liver (2.9 cm), normal pancreas, spleen, adrenal glands , and appendix. CT summary: may reflect an atypical hemangioma, focal nodular hyperplasia (I am on birth control pills), or hepatic adenoma. Suggests a nuclear medicine sulfur colloid study.

Just going from 103/104 down to 100/101. She says her stomach hurts really bad. Especially the left side and her back a little. She has bad smelly gas but regular bowl movements. She never complains of stomach problems. Unsure what to do. Most pediatricians act like the fever is no big deal. She has had her tonsils and adenoids out and still 9 ear infections. Just moved to Nevada. No pediatrician I like yet and no insurance. Can you help?","Doctor":"Hi...Thank you for consulting in Health Care magic.Fever of 2 days without any localizing signs could as well a viral illness. Usually rather than fever, what is more important is the activity of the child, in between 2 fever episodes on the same day. If the kid is active and playing around when there is no fever, it is probably viral illness and it doesn't require antibiotics at all. Once viral fever comes it will there for 4-7 days. So do not worry about duration if the kid is active.Paracetamol can be given in the dose of 15mg/kg/dose every 4-6th hourly that too only if fever is more than 100F.

Regarding the fall: as long as he didn't lose consciousness upon impact, and 24 hours have gone by without vomiting, the chances of head injury are very low. The fever, and the other symptoms, could be due to a combination of the shots and the teething. However, if the fever persists beyond 2 days, it's worth a chat with your doctor.

After going through your question in detail - this is my opinion and this is what I would have done if I were your treating pediatrician.Possibility -1. Cow's milk protein allergy is a strong possibility as there as blood in the stool in exclusively breast fed baby.Suggestions -1. Mother should go off the cows milk products completely - including biscuits and chocolates and all products related to milk.2. Continue exclusive breast feeding and if it is not sufficient you can opt for Zerolac.3. Cow's milk protein intolerance in transient as it will go off as the kid grows up.4. Avoid all cow's milk products till the kid is 1 year age.5. Mother's milk is the best for good growth of the baby.

Generally in case of preterm babies or in case of children suffering from lack of oxygen (hypoxia) soon after birth, there can be brain damage which could be a source of the seizures. Alternatively, some congenital structural malformations like corpus callosum agenesis can also give rise to such seizures. A ultrasonography of the brain needs to be done in order to evaluate the cause. Treatment depends upon the cause but you need to continue giving valparin and tegretol. All I can say is that in most cases the seizures come down with age and treatment but it depends upon the extent of damage."},{"Patient":"hello My baby girl is 6 weeks old and she is crying alot I give her bonnisan with no effect also infacol . it look like infacol is stoping  her from crying but she sleep only 1 hour. should i stop giving her all this? i also bought bonispaz. is it safe to give her all this natural syrops?","Doctor":"Babies often ingest air along with their food and hence suffer from abdominal distension which causes discomfort and hence the crying. Infacol (Simeticone) helps in reducing such pain and discomfort and may be given. You need not try all the others together. Bonnisan or bonnispaz are supposed to perform the same action. Let me mention that be it natural or synthetic, through any sort of medicine you are delivering some active principle which will bring about certain changes in our body. If the changes are for good, we call it benefit and if the chages are for bad, we call it side effects. So the safety profile of these natural syrups (as you call it) are no more or less than infacol.

I had her ice it and gave her two Motrin to get her through the night. She appeared to sleep well in spite of it. This morning she was hopping around on the ankle, claiming she couldn't put weight on it. I told her to stay in bed and elevate the ankle, and continue to ice it. I also told her she needs to try to move her ankle as it could be a mild sprain and just needs to be worked out. I inspected the ankle again, and there was no swelling, discoloration, bruising, inflammation or instability present.She insists that she has fractured it, and wants to argue with me about getting it x-rayed.So, I need your advice as to whether or not we need to go this far with it or not. I think rest, ice and stretching are going to be the antidote.Please advice","Doctor":"Our body is made of the bones as well as the soft tissue surrounding the bones. Unlike the bones that are visible in the x ray, these soft tissues that consist of the ligaments (structures connecting two bones) or tendons (the tough condensed ends of the muscles joined to the bone), are not visible in the x ray plate. If a fracture occurs, a plaster is done, but if soft tissue injury occurs, at least crepe bandage may be applied to immobilise the area so that it can heal fast. Application of ice provides relief. I would strongly suggest that you get an x ray done and visit a doctor with the report. Please continue applying ice as well as hot compress. I would not suggest stretching without the guidance of a doctor or a physical therapist."},{"Patient":"Is ventorlin good for child cold and cough ?hi,my 11yearS 4months old daughter was prescribed ventorlin syrup.ventorlin 5 ml 6 HOURLY ONCE times 7days ,she was first having cold with runny and blocked nose.i just wanted to know that dr.prescribed her a correct medication or not because ventorlin is a bronchodilator?it will have any side effect or not?she had no wheezing.it is dry coughing i think.","Doctor":"Ventorlin (Salbutamol) is a bronchodilator and your doctor has prescribed it because often in case of such cough, bronchospasm occurs.

The side effect of ventorlin is increased heart rate but let me assure you that this is a very widely used medicine and well tolerated and so you need not worry about the side effects.Give your child steam inhalation twice or thrice a day and I think that she would get some relief.

If you feel that the condition is worsening, please visit the ER rather than waiting for the doctor's appointment but if you feel that the condition is more or less the same, you may wait till tomorrow."},{"Patient":"My almost 4 year old daughter had a headache today and then later got a fever of 100.5. She has a fever and her legs are hot but her feet are cold. Is this super serious or not a huge concern? What should I do? I gave her children s Tylenol. and now she is sleeping.","Doctor":"Most of the fevers in children is caused due to viral infections. But cold extremities are caused due to low circulating blood volume and may be a cause of concern even if the child is sleeping peacefully. I would not classify it as super serious and would suggest you not to worry, but I would insist that you visit a pediatrician and get the child examined. Tylenol will help in bringing down the temperature if it is raised."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, My kid is 3 year 3 months. Past 2 days his temp is 102.he also has leg pain.

Should I give p250 in between if temp continues.","Doctor":"Hi,It seems that he might be having viral fever.Continue with Ibugesic or paracetamol.You can give paracetamol in between with 3-4 intervals.Give him plenty of water so that there might be having more sweating leading to fever down.Ok and take care.After 3-4 days if fever continues, consult your doctor again and go for investigations.Ok and take care."},{"Patient":"I have a pain on my right upper abdomen (about three inches over from my belly button and two inches up). The pain started about 10 days ago and it hurts badly when I cough or sneeze if I m standing or laying flat, but is okay if I sneeze sitting down. I was doing yard work with some heavy lifting 14 days ago and vaguely remember jabbing by stomach with the handle of a rake (but I m not positive it happened then). The spot is very tender and now has a slight pinkish color in the area (not a black and blue bruise ). It is not getting any better and is uncomfortable when I sit since my rib crushes that area. Any ideas? I thought maybe I pulled a muscle doing yard work but I don t remember any sudden pain doing it. I m 46 yo female. Thanks!","Doctor":"hello dear pain in upper abdomen after weight lifting could be a result of muscular tear. if you have fever also may be due to gallbladder or liver infection. hence its better to undergo ultrasound examination to rule out these causes. if it is muscular pain , you need to take complete rest and muscle reaxants. since you have tender,pinkish area, you need antibiotics also. hope this answer is helpful to you take care"},{"Patient":"Hi.

It has had happened in the past. When I mentioned to his pediatrician my concern last year, he listened to his heart and said it was nothing. Should I persue and get a second opinion or is it normal for a child to get low fever for a while from time to time? Thank you.","Doctor":"It is quite normal for children to suffer from fever from time to time and most often it is due to a viral infection. Last year the doctor had probably found the chest (lungs) to be clear (not the heart). You can definitely go for a second opinion but all I would say that you need not be concerned. Just give paracetamol to bring down the temperature. You may give steam inhalation which would be helpful in diluting cough if any."},{"Patient":"Hello Dr, my baby girl is 55days old..she cried a lot also don t wants to feed her last night...she just wants to sleep through out her night. ..last night i gave 0.5ml of colimex drops...not even pass her stools for past 4 days. ..can i give some hot water? ???","Doctor":"Exclusive breast feeding is recommended for children upto 6 months of age i.e. no water or any other type of feed needs to be given to a child of this age. Even if you give formula feeds if breast milk is not adequate or available, water does not need to be given (irrespective of temperature) as it will unnecessarily reduce the hunger and interfere with nutrition of the baby. For a baby of this age passing stool once in 10 days is as normal as is passing 10 times a day and in neither case there is any reason to be concerned. Colimex is for reduction of abdominal colic which can cause incessant cry. It will not cause stool to be passed."},{"Patient":"hello, My name is Maria.

I have started with mashed foods like carrots, apples, vegetables and cerelac. The doctor also asked us to start with lactogen. But he does not drink lactogen at all. Is it really necessary that he takes lactogen? If yes is there an alternative?","Doctor":"Weaning with semi solids is recommended from 6 months of age. You can give mashed rice boiled along with pulses and the vegetables that you mentioned. Basically it is a transition to adult food and practically any adult food low on spices can be introduced gradually but in the mashed form. Lactogen or milk is an accessory and may not be given if other nutritive principles are included.

It will also help in diluting the cough and provide relief. Give her steam inhalation. Just sit with the child on your lap and place the source of steam before you.

Since the amount of salt and water lost has not been adequately replenished, he has developed some amount of dehydration which is responsible for the low urine output. Your doctor is treating it in the right method and direction and you may rely on the same. I would additionally suggest adding zinc supplements like Syrup Zinconia 5 ml once daily for 5 days and it will help in the repair of the inner lining of the intestines which often gets damaged in such cases. Please continue the prescribed medicines as well as the food intake."},{"Patient":"my son is 2 yrs and 8months.he is suffering from severe coughHis doctor gave many medicines.tried out well.but it dint cure out.finally. doctor has now prescribed with Akurit Kid tablets and told to continue for 6 months which he gave  a 10 tablets before for testing.it worked out well.is this good..what disease my son actually has.?","Doctor":"Most of the cases of recurrent cough in children are due to viral cause. Your doctor has given Akurit Kid which is an antitubercular medication and therefore he suspects the child to be suffering from tuberculosis. I would strongly suggest that you first get the disease confirmed by tests like sputum analysis or even TB quantiferon gold test before administering such medicines. Since you have already started the medication, I would insist that you continue the medicines for the time being while you get the diagnosis confirmed."},{"Patient":"My baby had congestion and cough and dr prescribed her levolin syrup, phenergan, omnacortil.  She got to normal two weeks back. Three days ago she again started getting the cough with fever. Fever is gone with crocin but cough and blocked nose and congestion is still there. For three days I nebulised her with levolin 0.3mg thrice a day. Problems are still there but I am afraid to go to the dr as my daughter had too many antibiotics with different drs. Pls help","Doctor":"Giving saline nasal drops like nasoclear as per requirement should help in clearing the nasal block. If you think that nasal congestion still persists, you might try giving nasivion nasal drops (oxymetazoline) a few times a day and the nasal congestion should subside. Although it is probably caused due to a viral infection, you should still keep the child under the follow up of a pediatrician. I understand your concerns though."},{"Patient":"My grandson just got diagnosed with JRA and we got all kinds of answer regarding treatment, what do you suggest, is there a hot line that I can call to get more information, what kind of research are being done to treat this, I have lots of questions. Thank you for your time. Gabriella","Doctor":"Juvenile rheumatoid arthritis (JRA) or Juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) also known as juvenile chronic arthritis (JCA), is an autoimmune condition that affects children and adolescents and could lead to serious complications like eye inflammation which could even lead to blindness. Treatment is usually done with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and intra-articular corticosteroid injections. Sometimes methotrexate or TNF alpha blockers like etanercept, are used as disease modifying anti-rheumatic drug (DMARD) to suppress joint inflammation. There is no hotline available to help you procure information on the condition but a simple google search with the terms that I have mentioned, would give you enough information that would be both relevant and reasonable to satisfy the answers to your questions. You can also remain under the follow up of a rheumatologist who will be able to give you appropriate information and also would be able to treat the condition."},{"Patient":"Hello Doctor,Greetings!My son (3yr old) has ganglioglima problem. It has been identified by MRI scan last week. MRI scan report contains below findings\\"There is evidence of well defined small T2 hyper intense and T1 hypo intense lesion measuring 15*18 Mm noted involving the right hippocampus head. No evidence of surrounding edema seen. Post contrast study shows heterogenous enhancement of the lesion. Spectroscopy shows decreased NNA peak and increased choline peak.\\"Need clarification on:1. Is Surgery the only option to get better cure?2. since child is 3yr old, shall I wait for some months/year and plan the operation?3. is there any side affects/impact after this surgery? if so, what kind of impact will be there?4. after surgery, is there any possibilities for seizure to come?Kindly advise and help me to save my child. Thanks in Advance!","Doctor":"Ganglioglioma is a non cancerous tumour that arises from ganglion cells in the central nervous system. I would try to answer the questions one by one.1. There is no way to reduce it using medicines and surgery is the only option.2. Since it is non cancerous, you can wait, but I would not suggest you to do so. You need not worry about the age of the child. Till it is operated, it will affect brain functions and may cause seizures. So, earlier the surgery, the better.3. Since the tumour has affected the hippocampus which plays important roles in the consolidation of information from short-term memory to long-term memory and spatial navigation, the child could develop some problem in remembering on short term or long term basis and also may have some problems with spatial orientation. However, let me assure that a child's brain is plastic and the functions get redistributed quickly and so the chances of such loss will decrease the earlier the surgery is done.4. Although it is possible for seizures to come even after the surgery, the frequency will be less and it will probably resolve entirely with time."},{"Patient":"MY CHILD OF AGE 4 YEARS IS SUFFERING WITH FEVER FREQUENTLY .MEANS A COUPE DAYS EVERY MONTH.ALL TESTS FOUND NEGATIVE BUT THE PUS CELS VALUE IS 10-12.CAN U PLEASE EXPLAIN WHETHER IT IS A MAJOR OR MINOR AILMENT...? AND HOW TO CURE IT...N WHAT IS THE EFFECT OF THIS PUS CELS VALUE TO HEALTH..","Doctor":"Pus cells 10-12/hpf in urine indicate urinary tract infection which is the possible source of the fevers the child is suffering from. You need to take it on a serious note and visit a doctor and get it treated with a full course of antibiotics. Pus cells are basically white blood cells that have died in the process of fighting the infection in an effort to control it. It is not the pus cells but rather the infection that has negative effects on the health of the individual."},{"Patient":"Hi My daughter is 8 months old and had fever, cold, cough for 3-4 days. Urine test was done and found out in the result that pus cells count is 8-10 hpf. Please suggest remedies for this. We have given another sample for culture test and is due in a couple of days time. But in general, are there any natural remedies and is there anything to worry about?","Doctor":"Pus cells 10-12/hpf in urine indicate urinary tract infection which is the possible source of the fever the child is suffering from. It might also be related to a viral infection which generally causes the cough and cold. You need to visit a doctor and get it treated with a full course of antibiotics. The doctor will be able to subsequently tally using the culture and sensitivity reports if the antibiotics are supposed to be effective in the particular case of your daughter. The main natural remedy to reduce such infection would be to drink plenty of water which will help in flushing out the infection and would provide relief. It has to backed up with proper antibiotics and you need not worry if the course is completed. Maintaining proper hygeine is essential."},{"Patient":"My granddaughter, age 4, has been diagnosed with mononucleosis.  She is tired, and complains of pains in her stomach.  Her mother has been told that mono can affect her spleen and liver.  Can you explain how this happens?  Should she be seen by a specialist?  Thank you.","Doctor":"Infectious mononucleosis is a viral condition which affects lymphoid organs like tonsils, liver and spleen and such involvement could be the cause of abdominal pain that the child is complaining about. Although the disease is generally self limiting, it could also rarely progress to more serious conditions like splenic rupture and I would strongly suggest that you get the child examined by a pediatrician and remain under his follow up."},{"Patient":"Hi. My baby is 5 months old.usually she  takes  750ml per day.but last two weeks she has been taking around 600 ml only. Also she would vomit a little from15 minutes to 1 hour duration after feed.is it a correct quantity of formula for 5 months old baby?","Doctor":"Let me emphasize on the fact that breast milk is the best food for a baby. Most formula milks are cow milk based and hence hard to digest for a child of this age. Hence a child may not tolerate such formula milk and it is not ususual for a baby to vomit out such milk. It could also be due to gastro esophageal reflux which may occur due to not burping the child properly. Holding the child in upright position for around 20 mins after each feeds may help in resolving the issue.The quantity varies from child to child but 750 ml is supposed to be a decent amount. Generally it should not be more than 900 ml per day.Rather than trying to increase the amount of formula, I would rather suggest an early weaning with semi solids since the child is already 5 months old. It will help in ensuring proper nutrition for the baby."},{"Patient":"I have gastric problem -symptoms are burping always and having missed heart beats Am having severe gastric problem .symptoms are burping always and having missed heart beats when I have this problem.Once am relieved from this my heart beat is normal.presently taking pantocid DSR.how is thr gastric problem related to heart beat.?please explain it to me.","Doctor":"Hi, The gastro-cardiac reflex explains this phenomenon that when you have gastric problems, your heartbeats are getting missed, and once your stomach problem is relieved, your heart beats get back to normal. So, you need a good treatment to get rid of your gastric problem. Only in this way, you will avoid getting your heart into further trouble that might acquire a permanent character of missing heart beats and so on. Kind regards!"},{"Patient":"My 13 year old is a migraine sufferer. She takes 20 mg of amatryptaline daily. She has Maxalt and Imitrex for more severe days. She also takes daily meds for allegies and asthma (sigulair and zyrtec). She has recently been diagnosed with Hasimotos. We are pending both endocrinology and neurology appointments. My question is : My daughter is hesitant to use Imitrex but she seems to need Maxalt at least 5 times per week. Is Imitrex as safe as Maxalt (which makes her very tired). thanks! Cynthia","Doctor":"Imitrex (sumatriptan) and Maxalt (rizatriptan) are supposed to reduce pain in case of migraine. Imitrex (sumatriptan) is as safe as Maxalt (rizatriptan) to be given in migraine. But rather than these medicines, I would suggest giving her naprosyn (naproxen) 650 mg tablet as per requirement after feeding and I hope that she can get better results without feeling tired and without feeling hesitant about the given medications."},{"Patient":"good evening sir: 5 months old male child is  suffering from cough on/off, Runny nose, diarrhea 5-6 times since this morning, passes urine as before, takes breast feed well, got irritated due to diarrhea, redness noted near the anal area due to constant cleansing. we have been giving him ors solution and some lactobacillus sachets. should we start the baby on ofloxacin and ornidazole susp? thanks","Doctor":"Most of the diarrhoea in children is due to viral cause (rotavirus) where antibiotics are ineffective and I would not insist on starting ofloxacin and ornidazole suspension. Please continue the lactobacillus sachets and ORS and also give a reasonable amount of curd/yogurt. The perianal area has got exfoliated thus giving rise to the redness. Applying Siloderm Mixi ointment topically over the area for a few days and keeping the area open will help in fast healing. Please be patient as the diarrhoea should stop in a few days time. Since the child is otherwise fine, I would not worry."},{"Patient":"My son is 5 and just spiked a fever or 102.6. Every 2/3 minutes (for the last hour) he jerks in his sleep causing him to gasp and sit up really quickly. I have 4 kids and have dealt with my fair share of sickness but have never seen this. Is this normal???","Doctor":"Most fevers in children are caused by certain viruses. Although febrile convulsions can occur in case of high rise of temperature, going by your description it rather seems to be benign sleep myoclonus which is not harmful and you need not be concerned. It is normal and can occur in sleep. But I would strongly insist you to visit a pediatrician and to get the child assessed about the cause of fever so that it can be managed accordingly."},{"Patient":"Hi, I am 33 years old.  I have a son who is a very picky eater.  He is now 20 months old and still didn't know how to drink from the bottle.  I use the syringe to feed hime since he is 3 months old.  He didn't like to eat much.  I gave him 21 oz of whole milk a day.  I am thinking of giving him neopeptine to try, should it it OK?","Doctor":"Neopeptine is an enzyme supplement that is supposed to help in digestion in case there are related problems. Although it is ok to be given and can be safely given to a child of 20 months age, I doubt whether it would do any good and I would not suggest giving it. It is not unusual for children to be picky eaters. But milk is now supposed to be an optional food component with cereal based semi solid diet supposed to constitute the bulk of the feeds. Basically the child now needs a mashed version of adult food low on spices and oil."},{"Patient":"Dear Sir,My daughter is 3yrs old. She was having loose motions 3 days back. One of the doctors prescribed Metronidazole Benzoate Oral Suspension IP. There is a sudden change in the texture of her stool. It is black in color. Kindly advise.RegardsAnanya","Doctor":"If the stool is black and tarry, that sticks to the pan, it could be a cause of concern and may indicate upper gastrointestinal bleeding which would be a cause of concern. But if it is simply blackish, it could be due to change in diet. In any case, I would suggest you to visit a pediatrician and get a stool microscopy done. The treatment of the condition would depend upon the cause which can be made out by the doctor after the stool examination and so I would request you to be a bit patient in the meantime. Give the child oral rehydration solution (ORS) in the meantime to replenish the amount of salt and water lost."},{"Patient":"Hi my daughter who is 3 and a half has had a temperature of 37.6 since 2.30am and is now bringing up bile. she looks pale and is now cold to touch were as through the night she was extremely hot too touch. can you advise me on what to do. i have gave her ibuprofen and am trying to get as much liquids down her as i can. thank you sophie.","Doctor":"Infection is the most common cause of such fevers, but I would strongly suggest that you visit a doctor and get the child examined to rule out conditions like intestinal obstruction which could also give rise to such conditions. The paleness and cold to touch could indicate a condition called shock which occurs due to low amount of circulating body fluids, a condition that could occur in case of certain bacterial infections which might need to be treated urgently. Continue sponging the baby as you are doing and also give ibuprofen or alternatively Meftal syrup (mefenamic acid) which is more effective in reducing temperature but once again, let me emphasize the significance of visiting a doctor."},{"Patient":"Hi My son is 1 month old and is crying for 3 hours(not continously) daily from last 1 week.and ....daily once he will pass motion freely and 5 to 6 times he is passing small amount with crying...his stomach is also very tight....all our family memebers are suffering to his trouble.....kindly help me in this.....","Doctor":"Let me assure you that for a child of this age passing stool 10 times a day is as normal as passing stool once in 10 days and in either of the cases there is nothing to worry about. A child often cries due to increased air intake while feeding which may give rise abdominal distension and thereby abdominal colic. Giving Decolic infant drops 6-8 drops as per requirement should give the child relief. This is unrelated to the condition that other family members are suffering from. For them, increase the amount of greeen leafy vegetables in diet and also give fibre supplements like isabgol husk regularly at dinner and things should improve gradually."},{"Patient":"Sir I have a 4 month baby boy, his weight approx 5 kg.

As the production of breast milk depends on the sucking of the baby which in turn depends on the baby's hunger, if you give top feeds, the hunger comes down and so does the amount of breast milk produced.If you give NAN Pro 1, it is to be given as per the demand of the baby. Typically, babies of this age take around 4 ounces of feed 6-8 times a day but the amount can vary from baby to baby. It is to be prepared by mixing one scoopful of formula in one ounce of lukewarm water to reach proper concentration."},{"Patient":"Hi hopinng you can help me with a few inquries.

After followed his advised my son become ill and huge rash was followed in his body. my question is was this advise was good or not","Doctor":"Although most of the fevers are due to viral causes, often antibiotics are given to control superadded infections if any. Clavam contains amoxycillin+clavulinic acid both of which are safe to be given to a child. A dose of 375 mg is ok to be given to a child of 17 kg and you need not worry about that.In some cases like infectious mononucleosis, a viral condition, dose of amoxicillin may give rise to rashes. Although the doctor had given it in good judgement, the antibiotic needs to be discontinued and the rashes would soon improve on its own. You may apply some emollient/moisturiser in the meantime. You may also give levocetirizine 5 mg tablet once daily for 3-4 days."},{"Patient":"5yr old daughter came home with severe stomach ache, and fever of 102. Advil given and fever broke.

Doctor prescribed Mefast and Kefor dry  for 3 days. After 3 days he prescribed Malidens suspension and cefoxin dry for 3days. Now she is cured from fever and at present she is having dysentery -like symptoms( stomach pain while passing frequent stools). What is advisable for her now? Is it due to body heat or effect of medicine","Doctor":"Mefast (mefenamic acid) and Malidens (paracetamol) are supposed to bring down fever. Cefoxitin (mefoxin) is a broad-spectrum cephalosporin antibiotic intended to reduce the gastrointestinal infection that could be causing the fever which could also have killed the beneficial bacteria of our bowels and cause antibiotic associated diarrhoea. I think you wanted to say diarrhoea and not dysentery which means blood stained stool. If that is really the case, you would need to consult your doctor and get it treated. If it is diarrhoea, you need to give her curd/yogurt which contains beneficial bacteria and will help in restoring the balance. Alternatively, you can also give Enterogermina one sachet twice daily for 3-4 days.The diarrhoea is not due to body heat. It has probably caused due to the beneficial bacteria getting killed by the antibiotic medicine prescribed."},{"Patient":"Hi, I am very glad to say that god has gifted a boy baby to me.I am living in Bangalore.Now my baby is 4 - 5 months old.As I have joined my work after maternity leave, upto now I am giving Dexolac Stage 1 milk powder.Now he enters 4th month and neighbours are saying various powders like nestum,ceralac,etc...Kindly guide me which one should i give and there are also many flavours...please suggest me which one and which flavour can i give to my baby and also for furthur months also which flavours can i give?","Doctor":"Let me first mention that breast milk is the best food for a baby and there can be no alternatives for the same. If feasible, you can express your breast milk and store it in the wall of your refrigerator door so that it can be brought to room temperature later and given to your child while you are not there. Most formula milks are cow milk based and hence hard for the child to digest. If breast milk cannot be procured, any baby formula would do, and I would not place any preference. Cerelac or nestum are not milk substitutes. They are cereal based and are supposed to be started after weaning the baby to semi solids at 6 months of age. Early weaning can be done at 4-5 months and it is not totally objectionable. But if you boil rice togehter with pulses and vegetables and give it in the mashed form to your child, it will be equally nutritious if not more and I would definitely prefer this to the formula. Flavours are for taste and are just a matter of personal preference and nothing else. I would prefer rice based formula (like nestum rice or cerelac rice) compared to wheat based formula (plain cerelac)."},{"Patient":"My son 6yers old has always cough.Even after nebulisation it is not cured and so he cant sleep properly.Due to cough he vomets also.

Thank you.","Doctor":"Your child is probably suffering from a viral infection which is often associated with enlarged tonsils which is responsible for his snoring and sleeping difficulty. The attempts of cough out may trigger the gag reflex which may trigger vomiting instead. Nebulisation is supposed to help in liquefying the cough and should help in resolving the situation eventually.Give him some antiallergic syrup like Relent which will also act as a mucolytic and help in liquefying the cough. It will also help in reducing the runny nose. You may give Ondem syrup thrice daily half an hour before food if he has vomiting. Continue the nebulisation. Gurgling with lukewarm water should be helpful for the tonsils."},{"Patient":"Hi doc my daughter is one and a half year old she is passing stool 10 to 12 time a day dr advice domcet twice a day or interogermina liqed once a day ascazin twice a day but she is passing watrey stool then i am giving Sporlac ds 120 tablet after that I am very conscious. kindly share ur experience can some side effect of sporlac ds 120","Doctor":"A child of this age could be having persistent gastro colic reflex which could make her pass stool after each feed and it could be entirely normal. For diagnosing a gastrointestinal infection I would have liked to look at the stool microscopy report. If pus cells are present in significant number, I would think of such an infection and would treat them with the antibiotics. I would suggest you to give oral rehydration solution (ORS) to replenish the salts and water lost. Enterogermina and sporlac are the right medicines to be prescribed and are safe to be given. You need not bother about side effects while giving these medicines. I and most other doctors prescribe these and no side effects are reported."},{"Patient":"My daughter had a C-section 3 weeks ago and developed a high fever hours after the surgery. She was on antibiotics for 3 days and they sent her home. Thls week she developed another high fever and the doctors hospitalized her put her on antibiotic drip and did a cat scan and found blood clots on her uterus or ovary.. Should they be giving her an anticoagulant drug to dissolve these clots? They said they would dissolve on their own. Please answer my questions, but she is in severe pain in which they gave her some morphine. . I am a very concerned mother that lives out of her state. I am concerned that the clots could dislodge and travel ..Thank you","Doctor":"I am sorry to hear about your daughter. The blood clots that the doctors have detected are probably located inside the uterus. It so happens that during the pregnancy, the placenta remains attached to the inner surface of uterus (endometrium). After the delivery, the placenta comes out and so does the endometrium too eventually as the uterine blood vessels cut squeeze and cut off the blood supply there and the uterus contracts to squeeze it out. As a result, the remaining portion of the endometrium comes out in the form of bleeding. But if some amount of placental tissue remains adherent, it might not easily come out and the uterus contracts repeatedly trying to expel it, thus causing the pain for which she needs to be given pain medication like morphine. These are the blood clots that the doctor is talking about. These could have got infected, causing the fever.For the infection to subside, the blood clots need to come out, which would probably happen on its own. Antibiotics and paracetamol are required. Since the blood clots are not inside a blood vessel, the chances of dislodging and travelling is unlikely."},{"Patient":"hello, my 10  year old son said his stomach hurt last night and this morning he made it threw school a 1/2 day he is burping and it smells like rotten eggs he also puked and it stuck like eggs also he is now running a 100 fever he said the milk at school was bad yesterday in school could that be what is doing it ? or do u think he needs to be seen","Doctor":"Probably your son has got a gastro intestinal infection which is demonstrated by the presence of fever and foul smelling burp along with vomiting. Most of such infections are self correcting and recovery occurs in 3-5 days irrespective of the use of antibiotics. The mainstay of treatment would be to give oral rehydration solution (ORS) to replenish the amount of salts and water lost.

The lump on his left breast could be a lymph node. these typically swell in the presence of infection. They are usually not worrisome. The more concerning thing is the chest with breathing.

Hope this answer will help! First of all there is nothing to worry about a child with cough, runny nose and fever which lasts for at least 2-3 days-especially if he is energetic and a good eater. This is because at this age he meets many virus infections and \\"fights\\" against them. Related with pneumonia, it can be caused by viruses, and usually if he is doing well, if he is energetic and active is left untreated(normal vitals, fever for 2-3 days, normal appetite). If it's bacterial, with fever which lasts more than 3 days, loss of appetite and the child is not active is treated with antibiotics.If fever lowers after 24-48 h it means that AB has been effective and there is no resistance. The sounds in lungs and the X Ray changes will last for at least 6 weeks after treating it. So for being sure that pneumonia is treated I would see the child and his symptoms (no fever, no cough, normal appetite and energetic) and not the X Ray after treatment.So overall this is the view of a 3.5 yo child in winter!"},{"Patient":"my 11 and a half month old came down with a mild fever this evening and im sure what is causing it. i initially thought it was one of two things. the first being that she bumped her head today on a wooden stool, hard but not extremely hard. a purple mark showed up right away but no raised bump. she cried a minute but long and has been eating, playing and napping normal. the other being that she was fed blueberries a few hours following the head bump and a few hours before i noticed the fever. she has had a mild reaction to blueberries every time shes eaten it, just a mild flesh colored rash on her face arms and belly for a day or two afterwards.

What are your thoughts","Doctor":"Thank you for the query.By your description it is quite clear that its non epileptic seizures.This usually appears at adolescence.Aggravate during premenstrual periods, due to hormonal changes.This is mostly due to psychological reasons. Depression could also be the reason, which is very common premenstrually.Some physical exercise on regular basis, psychological counseling and if needed Psychiatric counseling (this does not mean she has mental disorder) may help her immensely.One needs to be patient so that the child is able to cope in better way.To keep in touch with the neurologist is advisable."},{"Patient":"My son, 12 came home from school today dizzy, exhausted and throwing up.

She had a little bit of a cough and dry throat however I did not notice any fever. The rash is not blistery but more mottled..the rash next her ears and under chin was really red, almost shade of purple. The pharmacist who I saw suggested texa for skin rashes which really took the rash away when given to her. The rash is not constant but comes and goes, sometimes mottled but sometimes patchy?

After which he is tired and sleeps.i m worried as his stomach remains empty after so much of vomiting. please help me and my son. My son is on mixed feed. N i m non vegetarian.does it have something with my diet? Please help.","Doctor":"Let me mention that breast milk is the best food for a baby and there can be no alternatives for the same. Most formula milks are cow milk based and hence difficult to digest. Since you mention that the child is on mixed feeds, it is likely that the vomiting is occurring in response to the supplemental feeds and not really to the breast feeds. Often children cannot tolerate such supplemental feeds and vomit it out. In case of cold, such regurgitative tendency often increases. Giving the child Domstal suspension 0.5 ml thrice daily before feeds should help in reducing such episodes. The other thing to be done is to try to increase breast feeding as much as possible as compared to the supplemental feeds.In case the vomiting still does not subside, please take the child to a doctor who can evaluate for presence of pyloric stenosis which may also be the cause of such symptoms.About your own feeding, remember that you are feeding for two persons and not one. Just take a healthy diet in increased amount and things should be fine. Animal proteins are essential and can be taken in the form of milk, curd or cheese."},{"Patient":"i have a 5 year old son that seems to show both signs of adhd and aspergers.... they are treating hin for the adhd with concerta 27 and risperdal .5 at night.... hes still impulsive and hyper.... hes been on the meds for a year now i dont think this medicine is working.... can strattera be given to him at his age and is it used for both conditions?","Doctor":"Strattera is a good medication for ADHD and can be given to your son.  It takes a few weeks to see the full benefit so  some some doctors will continue the concerta for the first month while building up the Strattera.  The benefit if Strattera is that it also lowers anxiety, it lasts 24 hours so once a day dosing is enough, there are no rebound symptoms as seen with the stimulant medications and it does not suppress the appetite as much.  It might also allow you to stop the Risperdal, a medication which I personally feel should not be used for long periods of time and should be avoided in children as young as your son. He will need a lot of help navigating the social aspects of life if he has high functioning autism.   What was formerly called Asperger syndrome is now included in the Autistic spectrum.  Children who fit this description can have difficulty reading others and want desperately to fit in but feel they cannot understand their peers. They are also more often than not unusually smart and intensely focused on a particular interest.  If you are one to watch TV, see the first season of Bones for an very accurate depiction of a brilliant person with Asperger’s.  It is based on a real individual and does a good job of showing what it is like for the affected person.  Another possible area of difficulty might be motor pragmatics, i.e. complex motor activities such as sports may seem difficult or the child may seem too awkward.  If this is the case, introducing him to Yoga and one of the martial arts with individual lessons one on one not in a group at first will help him build motor skills and confidence.  Imagine if everyone were born knowing how to play the piano.  Those of us who could not would be considered disabled.  Children with Aspergers have to learn social skills much like you or I would have to practice the piano.  Specifuc explanations and detailed instruction with role playing and the use  of the \\"social stories\\" books will give him a frame of reference.  As he gets a but older, others may try to get him into trouble by sensing his desire to fit in and his naive nature, using it for their own vivacious enjoyment as they see him misbehave at their encouragemeant.  Warn him not to do things he is being asked to do by others unless they, too are participating and he is sure the activities are ok.  Invite children over to play with him at your home and inconspicuously coach him if he falters.  Read about Asperger’s and talk with other parents and even their older children.  Know that he can have a full and rewarding life and he is not defined by a disability but rather blessed with a difference that has a lot of benefits.  Thomas Jefferson, Bill Gates, Einstein, Steven Spielberg, Dan Akroyd, Alexander Graham Bell, and many others have this diagnosis and are very successful."},{"Patient":"Hi i filled my bath tub with warm water and a 1/4 cup or so with pure bright germicial ultra bleach. i have two young girls ages 2-5 when i went to mop the kitchen i came back the they had their hand in the water. Every since, my two year old is VERY fussy. not usually like it. im worried what happened in the 2 seconds i turned my back","Doctor":"Do not worry.  Bleach in the bathwater is actually one method of treating severe eczema and in that case 1/2 cup in a full tub is sued for a prolonged bath follow by sealing in the moisture.  It is process called “bleach bath and dose and seal” developed by allergy experts to address moderate to severe eczema persisting because of staph on the skin.  Your two year old is not likely fussy from the water, it may be something else."},{"Patient":"My 3yr old son has been throwing up for the past 5 hours. He threw up food at first then yellowish orange and now dark brown muscus the past 6 times, is this something serious or just because he has an empty stomach. He doesn t have a fever and he s doesnt seem to be in pain just very tired.","Doctor":"Your child is showing symptoms of dehydration and should be seen right away so his vomiting can get under control and he can take in fluids.  This much vomiting can lead to biochemical abnormalities that require IV fluids and can be the result of something as innocent as a viral infection to something more serious causing intestinal obstruction.  I recommend you consider this as serious and take him a doctor tonight to be on the safe side as he is small and becoming weak."},{"Patient":"My son is 9yrs old & has spherocytosis, he has an enlarged spleen. He plays football and now wants to play rugby should we be worried about not wearing a spleen guard. He also has crohns so the option of spleen removal has now been put on the back burner. Thanks","Doctor":"You are caught between a rock and a hard place.  Splenectomy would improve the spherocytosis but the presence of Crohns puts the halt on that.  Is the diagnosis of Crohns a firm one or one in progress?   Has he been tested for celiac disease? Independent of the above issues, football and rugby are high risk sports for any 9 year old and recurrent concussions have occurred more often that we like in both.  Would your son consider an alternative sport such as a martial art or swimming for example.  If he were my patient, I would discourage the football and rugby even if we were not worried about his spleen."},{"Patient":"My baby is 3months and 6days her weight is 6.5 and she has persistent dry cough and she has been having a blocked nose since 2 months but her nose only gets blocked at night, please how do I cure her because the paracetamol that she got at the hospital is not working at all","Doctor":"When I hear persistent dry cough and nasal congestion worse at night the first thing I think of is reflux.  It causes an irritant cough when microaspiration of refluxed material occurs and nasal swelling due to the exposure of the posterior nasal airway to an acid environment.  An antacid will help the swelling but the cough will not respond to n antacid and the reflux will have to be treated.  If your baby is bottle fed, you can thicken her formula with a tsp of rice cereal per ounce to decrease the liquidity and discourage reflux.  You should also have her upright after meals for at least an hour and possible have her sleep with the head of her bed elevated about 45 degrees. If these measures do not relieve the cough, she will need further testing to determine the severity of the reflux.  All babies have some reflux as infants but it should not be leading to cough and nasal stuffiness. Some babies also cry a lot both from the nasal congestion and the heartburn.  If this is the case, she would cry and arch her back, seem relieved after feeding a bit but then start to be uncomfortable again a few minutes after.  This is another clue to reflux.  Significant reflux must be evaluated with visualization of the esophagus, stomach and small intestine to assure there is no other structural abnormality contributing to it such as malrotation.  Milk protein intolerance can also be a contributing factor and the upper GI small bowel follow through study would provide a clue to this if there appeared to flocculation of the material in the small intestine.  This would be treated with a hypoallergenic formula."},{"Patient":"My son who is 14 has been nauseous for 4 months and I m wondering if it could be related to his Invisalign? He has hasmd tins of lab work, seen a GI doc and a cardiologist. Now he us being told it s anxiety. He was a completely normal child up until 4 months ago; social, good appetite, outgoing, type B personality.","Doctor":"Did your son have a recent growth spurt?  There is a common phenomenon that can occur in growing teens called physiologic postural orthostatic tachycardia.  It results when the autonomic nervous system is out of sync with the growing child.  You would determine this at the bedside by measuring his heart rate after he is lying down for 20 minutes and the right after he stands up for a few minutes.  A difference if greater that 30 beats per minute is suggestive and it should respond to increasing his salt and water intake. Find out soon because the sooner this is identified the more quickly it can be relieved. It does not sound like anxiety and I do not think the invisalign is causing any problems."},{"Patient":"My 9 yr. old daughter has a rash on her trunk, and on one foot. We took her to urgent care and they tested her positive with strep throat (no fever or sore throat). They took blood work and found her white blood cell count was 2.8. They were concerned and asked me to have it tested again tomorrow. We just came back from Six Flags yesterday (water rides and roller coasters). Perhaps she picked up a bacterial infection? Or a tick that went unnoticed. I don t know where to start researching.","Doctor":"Without seeing the rash it is difficult to determine how it fits into this picture but a WBC of 2.8 is certainly low and inconsistent with strep.  A low WBC can occur with viral illness,  a much more likely situation  than other possibilities for low count  in her age group.  The combination low WBC and rash suggests viral infection.  A much more remote possibility is early leukemia which should be identified quickly as it can be readily treated.  Autoimmune disorders can also cause a low WBC but this, too, is far less likely at her age.  My recommendation is that you have her primary care doctor see her tomorrow, consider rechecking the blood work with a bit more detail, and follow his or her advice regarding continued monitoring until the counts return to normal vs more in depth investigation."},{"Patient":"Hi.

My question is that I ve had a few cases of diarrhoea since, not every single day though. It s been going from good to bad since my surgery but was completely fine before my surgery. I am wondering if this is normal and because of my surgery?","Doctor":"hello, I would have liked to know your age and whether you still have abdominal pain associated with the diarroea and if yes which part of the abdomen. As of the information provided,probably there was a highly inflammed and adherent appendix,propably appendicular mass due to which surgeon had difficulty doing Laparoscopically.In such cases there r chances that the infection takes about  10-15 days to settle down completely and could be the cause of diarrhoea. In this case it will slowly settle down.Is it associated with any abdominal pain? is the diarrhoea completely watery or pastelike,any blood or mucus?how many times a day? Another cause could also be antibiotics associated diarrhoea, but unlikely as u said they are intermittent episodes.Only if fever or associated with severe abdominal pain do consult your surgeon or if this doesnot subside after 15 days u can consult him.

When you do take him to the doctor, mention that he is a “shell” of his former self and you are concerned about possible neglect on the part of his mother.  If there is a child protective service where you are, they should be contacted and asked to look into the home situation as well as have medical review of the child’s condition, especially as it relates to deterioration in level of health and well being.

When a suture closes early, there can be narrowing of the area that would have grown if the suture remained open a normal amount of time. The metric suture, in the middle of the forehead, continues on to the sagittal suture which goes from the forehead straight back to the back of the head.  Closure of these sutures is not of any clinical significance but can present concern about cosmetic appearance. Most of the time this is not an issue for the child as it is so mild as to be unnoticed unless one looks very closely.  The only concern for early suture closure arises when there is closure interfering with brain growth in two directions.  Then surgery to reopen the sutures is done. Your child will be a normal child and the appearance you are so concerned about now will seem like nothing in the future."},{"Patient":"My 8 year old son is running a fever of 102, is complaining of being dizzy off and on, states his lower back hurts and he has a hard lump right under his jaw bone in the middle of his jaw. I have had a child a long time ago with meningitis and talked him through the symptoms of that and he doesn t have as stiff neck and isn t throwing up. He started complaining of being dizzy last Wed. after a strenuous hike. He also has a chin injury about a month ago which required dermabond to close a wound. His jaw was not checked for injury at the ER. I m not sure what to think at this point. I thought he had a jaw injury when he had his chin closed but....","Doctor":"I am assuming you mean the lump is to the side and not in the middle of his neck under the jaw.  This is the location of submandibular lymph nodes which can be enlarged during viral infections and also with strep.  A fever of 102 and aches would go along with either.  Strep can be present in the absence of a sore throat and when I see a child with fever and submandibular node enlargement, I  always do a strep test just to be on the safe side. I suggest you have his doctor examine him and consider a strep screen regardless of whether he has a sore throat or not.  If the screen is negative and culture sent and negative then he can rest and allow this illness to resolve on it’s own."},{"Patient":"My child is very violent and abusive towards me.

He already sees a psychiatrist and a therapist and takes Adderral, Paxil and Trazadone. Something is wrong with him and it is getting worse as he gets older. What could it be and what can I do?","Doctor":"YYour son may have bipolar disorder.  The things to consider are: Is there a family history of severe mood disorders? Does your child seem to have dramatic changes in his personality, mode of expressing himself, behavior, facial expression, demeanor during his aggressive rages and then after an episode is over does he seem to feel sorry but not really appreciate the details of what he has done? Does his personality return to normal briefly after a rage? Can you tell just by the look on his face or the way he is speaking that he is going to go into a rage and is it impossible to reason  with him when he is in a rage? Does he become extraordinarily strong during a rage episode? Does he appear to be menacing, threatening, frightening, unwilling to back down and unusually cruel in what he says and does?  Does he seem, after a rage attack, to be at peace, more normal, kind, apologetic?  Does he truly not remember the detail of what he has said or done or does he seem to disregard the seriousness as if he does not believe what he is told he did?  Does he have difficulty going to sleep? Does her seem unhappy and discouraged a lot, as though he is unable to help himself feel good?  Does he have a lot of anxiety? Are these symptoms more common at home or when he is trying to “shut down his brain” after playing games or otherwise occupying his mind.  If these seem to relate to your child, he needs to stop the Adderall, wean the Paxil and start a mood stabilizing medication like Tegretol.  Once he has been stabilized on the Tegretol and the episodes have stopped, remaining ADHD symptoms can be safely treated with a stimulant medication.  These episodes are seizure like events arising from the amygdala and the use of a stimulant medication makes them more frequent and more severe.  So does the use of Paxil.  When he starts Tegretol, you will immediately notice a few things.  He will be happier, will be able to sleep well, will not have such severe rages.  As the body builds a tolerance to Tegretol until the maximal metabolism of it is in place, you may notice backsliding and need to raise the dose repeatedly over a period of a week or two until he saturates the ability of his liver to metabolize it after which this level will remain steady and he will stop having rages.  When this happens, you will notice what I call the Tigger stage, where he will be happy and very hyperactive, impulsive.  This is the time to start the stimulant medication to fuel the parts of the brain in the frontal area that have not been well fueled because the rage activity has been such a great consumer of fuel. Make sure his doctor is taking all of this seriously as interruption of this process will eventually extinguish it and prevent  long term psychiatric disability.  Allowing these episodes to continue will cause the development of permanent neutral pathways of responding to life in the manner he does when in a rage and therein lies chronic psychiatric disability.  He is young and with proper treatment you can have your child back and assure his good future. Best of luck to you an feel free to contact me again should you run into difficulty or have further questions.  Remember, he is the child you love.  His symptoms are not him and he is not in control of what he does during episodes of rage."},{"Patient":"I have a 14 yr old daughter. She has entire body pain all over.

Your daughter’s pain is not caused by depression,  The depression is being caused by the pain.  It is well known that chronic pain leads to depression.  Chronic pain also interrupts the sleep cycle leading to more pain.  Is your daughter “double jointed” i.e. can she place her palms on the floor when bending over, can she hyperextend her knees, elbows? do her ankles seem loose? Does she have lightheadedness when arising from lying down, weakness, generalized abdominal discomfort?  If any of these are present, have her checked for Marfan syndrome or Ehlers Danlos Syndrome, both of which can cause pain everywhere with normal labs.  These are disorders of connective tissue structure and are quite painful.  Treatment is possible but accurate diagnosis is necessary.  Ask to have her seen by a specialist in pain and or physical medicine and rehabilitation, both specialties will  be able to sort out the diagnosis.  Knowing why she hurts will go a long way toward relieving the trauma for her and replace her sense of hopelessness with a direction she can take to start to get better."},{"Patient":"okay so my one year old has cellulitis he went to the hospital and doctors monday the 7th and since then the redness has went down but the bump is still there hard its not making him cry but does pus have to come out or can it just go away with medicine?","Doctor":"Hello. I just read through your question. It seems that the treatment plan for the cellulitis was the correct one. It is good that the redness has gone down. The bump you describe will take longer to resolve. As long as it continues to remain painless, the medicine you were given is enough. Pus does not have to come out of it in order for it to resolve."},{"Patient":"Hello, my 5yr old woke up a little bit ago with a nightmare, shortly after she vomits and has diarrhea. She seemed lightheaded and her temperature was only 95.3f. She also said she felt very hot. Her temperature is usually 97.6f. Within 30 minutes of waking she was all cleaned up, saying she felt better and went back to sleep. Should I worry? If she feels better and wants to go to school in 5hrs should I let her or make her stay home to keep a eye on her?","Doctor":"Your child could have got an indigestion which might have made her throw up. If this does not recurr, there is no cause to get concerned. In case, it recurrs, you need to give her Ondem syrup to reduce the vomiting and also oral rehydration salt (ORS) to replenish the salt and water lost.If she feels fine and wants to go to school you can definitely send her to school and there is no harm in doing so."},{"Patient":"my son is 6 months, 7 days old. we have introduced potato to him. he is passing his motion in water type and going for 5 to 6 times per day. this is goingon for past 3 days. doctor prescribed enterogermina respules for 3 days and then zinconia syrup for 14 days and also ors liquid. why zinconia have to give? wt will be the reason for this loose motion? his motion is yellow color and while going lot of bubbles r coming. only after breastfeeding he is passing motion. mother is not having any problem.","Doctor":"Your child could have got a gastro intestinal infection which is the likely cause of his loose motion. It is also possible that he is still not used to the new kind of food and hence the passage of loose stools. The bubbles are due to bacterial degradation of undigested food in the intestines and hence support this fact. Let me assure you that the child can pass stool after every feed due to a phenomenon called gastro-colic reflex which is absolutely normal and there is nothing to be worried about.Zinconia or zinc supplements help in the repair of the thin inner lining of the intestines (intestinal epithelium) which gets damaged during episodes of loose stools and hence needs to be given for a few days. Enterogermina contains beneficial bacteria that reside in our intestines and may help in controlling the loose stools."},{"Patient":"my six year old is complaining about her leg hurting in the front bottom part.she has cried at times with it.it may be in one leg or sometime it is in both.some say its growing pains.but would it hurt in the front like that.no swelling or anything has happened.","Doctor":"Hello. I just read through your question. I agree that this is most likely growing pains. However, I still feel it's worth a visit to your doctor just to make sure. In the meantime, if the pain is unbearable she may be treated with Ibuprofin."},{"Patient":"hi, ive for the past week been gettings stomache cramps, through day and night and also been losing like a greeny brown discharge its not smelly but very annoying, also i have been feeling at certain times in the day nausia and have actually vomited twice, i dont think i can be pregnant as i had the implanon inserted about 4 months ago so what could this be?","Doctor":"Hi.Thanks for your query. The obvious cause for your stomach cramps, nausea, vomiting, can be due to PID- Pelvic Inflammatory Disease as you have history of green brown discharge. There may be vaginitis which has migrated to the pelvis cavity to cause PID. Since implanon is there, no chance of pregnancy, so not to worry about it. I would advise you the following:Get an ultrasonography of the abdomen and pelvis, tests of blood, urine and stool to rule any problem. Consult a Gynecologist, get an internal examination done and go for the tests and investigations and treatment as advised by her. You may need a treatment with an antibiotic, metronidazole, anti-fungal oral and vaginal tablets, good local hygiene.No sex till you are alright and ask your sexual partner to get examined, investigated and treated if you want the recurrence."},{"Patient":"I am female, 5 3, 115ibles, run cross counrtry, eat extremely healthy, very fit. 4 months ago I started having cramping pain in my abdomanal area and now it s my hole stomach only when I would move or run... Now it s all the time. Ever scenee this started I am more tired than usual and I pee frequently(I only drink water). My stools are eatherr really hard, or like watery diahreah or very soft and falls apart. What do u think is going on??","Doctor":"Hi, There are many possibilities in you. Most importantly, I feel Appendicitis has to be ruled out here. In addition, there may be stone in the urinary tract. I suggest you to get an ultrasound scan of the abdomen and look for any of these. The treatment will depend on the cause. If the ultrasound is normal, then IBS (Inflammatory Bowel Disease) may be considered too. I hope this helps you. Regards,"},{"Patient":"My 11 year old Pom. Had the runs this weekend now just very soft have to lock him in the kitchen cus we don t know when he will go potty he seems like he feels fine then once he layed in one spot for an hour seemed really sick then all of a sudden he got up was hungry and seemed fine???????????","Doctor":"Your question is not clear. Probably you are talking about your younger brother who is having diarrhoea. If that is the case, treatment will be supportive and would consist of giving oral rehydration solution or ORS in order to replenish the salt and water lost. Just mix a sachet of ORS in the designated amount of water (200 ml or 1 litre depending on the size of the sachet) and give it frequently to him. If not adequately hydrated, the child will go into dehyration and become sick."},{"Patient":"My 4 month old son had white chunks in his stool earlier today and just again when I changed his diaper. It is not the normal seedy stool. They were noticeably larger white chunks. I am taking him to the pediatrician tomorrow morning but I would like some insight on this. The other symptoms I am taking him to the Dr for is congestion, extremely stuffy nose (hard time breathing while laying on his stomach), low fever, and a lot crabbier than usual. He had his 4 month shots a week ago and also had his first 2 teeth come in a month ago.","Doctor":"You have not mentioned whether the child is exclusively breast fed or whether supplemental feeds are being given. Most formula milks are cow milk based and hence difficult to digest and may contain white undigested portions in the stool and that is probably what you are referring to. It is normal and you need not worry about that. You can still get the stool microscopy done before you visit the doctor and that will help in confirmation.Children of this age have small nostrils which can easily get blocked. Applying nasal saline drops like nasoclear help in removal of the blockage and give the child relief. Fever indicates infection and probably your child has a viral infection which is associated with such infections."},{"Patient":"My almost 5 year old daughter has developed a spreading rash that looks like hickeys on the back of her legs just above her knees towards the inside. What is it and what can I do for it? I've tried hydrocortisone cream, anti fungal cream, and Benadryl. We have not changed any of our usual eating habits or hygiene habits, lotions, detergents etc. They don't itch or hurt. They keep spreading all over her legs now looking again.","Doctor":"Such rashes are frequently caused due to certain viral infections although fungal  infection due to sweating is also quite likely. Treatment is generally supportive and consists of application of emollients and moisturisers. You can use hydrocortisone cream which is a steroid but I would not suggest its indiscriminate use without supervision of a doctor. Rather than use of anti fungal cream, I would prefer use of antifungal powders like Candid (clotrimazole) powder. Giving some antiallergic like levocetirizine can be helpful. Since they are not associated with fever or itchiness, I would not worry but please visit a doctor if the rashes get worse or associated with fever."},{"Patient":"Hi Actually I don t have enough milk from beginning so I kept my baby most of the times on lactogen. Now she is 3 months old. People suggest me to start with cows milk or either nan-1 as they say nan-1 contains DHA which is good for brain development.Please help me. M wworried.","Doctor":"Mother's breast milk is the best possible food for a baby and there can be no alternatives for the same. Most of the formula milks are cow milk based and hence hard to digest for the baby. NAN-1 and lactogen are both cow milk based formula manufactured by the same company where certain items have been added or removed from lactogen to make NAN-1 more like breast milk. DHA has also been added since it is required for the developing brain but do not expect it to enhance brain development. NAN-1 is more preferrable to cow milk if breast milk is unavailable. Please try to give breast milk as much as possible and supplement only the rest."},{"Patient":"My 3 year old son today showered and I was dressing him and found a lump behind his right ear, in the past he would say he gets dizzy and legs would hurt. Then his pre-k teacher stated he sweats while he naps and I witnessed that one day. Could this be cancer","Doctor":"The growth is unlikely to be cancer and you need not jump to conclusions. To be able to comment on what exactly it is, it needs to be examined properly. Please visit a doctor and get your child evaluated. Sweating during naps may be normal if it is humid to some extent."},{"Patient":"My 3 year old son still wears diapers at night. All the sudden a red cluster of bumps show up around the skin above the penis and in the crease of his leg and hes scratching them. Is this possibly diaper rash or something to be concerned and checked out.","Doctor":"Your child is likely to be suffering from diaper rash which is basically contact dermatitis that occurs when the skin gets inflamed due to constant contact with the moist nappies. Often it gets some secondary fungal infections as well. The solution would be to keep the area dry and open for sometime if feasible. Candid (clotrimazole) powder may be used. With the mentioned steps, things should soon improve and there should be no reason to be concerned. But it can worsen if no steps are taken."},{"Patient":"Hi,my son had his tonsils and adenoids 4 days ago.i was giving ice cream and ice poles to help his tonsils ,but I am afraid it was not being good for his rhinitis .He starts his cough at night ,2 days ago,and during the day too.My question is,is it ok to give him nasonex to help his rhinitis ? I am giving clarytine (started yesterday).I am afraid the cough gets worst and have trouble in regards bleeding .","Doctor":"Some children are more prone to cold which is basically a viral infection. In many such cases, tonsils get enlarged. Generally such infections are associated with an allergic component and since Claritin (Loratadine) is an antiallergic, the child will get some relief. Nasonex (Mometasone Furoate) is a mild grade steroid which helps in reducing the nasal congestion associated with such infections. Both of these medicines are both safe and effective and can be given to a child suffering from such infections. I would suggest you to give the child steam inhalation. Water in the form of vapour will reach deep into the sinus cavities and lungs and help in diluting the cough and will help in resolving the complaints and it would be unlikely to become worse."},{"Patient":"Hi , I just came back form doctor office where my 5 year old daughter got the was remoal from her rightside ear. Despite attempts and several time using the ear wash device and 5 days of ear drop , the wax did not came out. The doctor used a something like what ladies us eto shape their eyebrow (metal tool) and that caused my daughter's ear to bleed at the time of suing the tool my daughter was feeling severe pain. The doctor said the bleeding is normal. I just wante dto make sure this has not caused damage to her ear . Thanks, Simin","Doctor":"In most cases, ear wax gradually comes out on its own and we never even notice it. At times, when earwax gets impacted, it may become hard and adherent to the skin. A forceful attempt to remove it may cause pain and even some amount of bleeding. In order to avert such things from happening, drops like ceruklear or other wax softeners are used before such procedure is attempted. By saying damage to the ear, what you actually mean is damage to the eardrum. Ear wax generally gets collected on the periphery of the ear canal and not on the eardrum, so no harm is expected in this regard. Moreover, an ENT doctor is supposed to be aware and hence you need not fear if you have gone to a doctor for wax removal."},{"Patient":"my daughter went to the pediatrician last week with bumps on her body.

The rash of most of such infections have specific characteristics and so it is really tough to comment without examining.

My on is 4 years old and is on an 18 month waitlist to go and see a specialist in Calgary. I m just concerned about a spot on his head. He was born with it and it didn t seem to be much of a problem until the last year. It s a light pink colour, maybe the size of a looney. His hair has never grown in there, and it sometimes turns a bit darker in colour if it gets too much sun. We always try to cover it up, but lately he s been scratching it and it bleeds a little. It doesn t seem to bother him too much, but it definitely worries us. Just wondering if it s something we need to worry about too much. It s really strange because nobody in my family or my husband s family seem to have anything like this. Should we be worried?","Doctor":"Hi...by what you quote, I feel this is a hemangioma or an venous malformation over the skin there. But as you say it is bleeding a bit, I think it is a matter or concern. Such hemangiomas are bound to form ulcers easily. If it forms an ulcer and if there is fever, I suggest you take him to emergency room.Regards - Dr. Sumanth"},{"Patient":"My new born baby Leo who is 5 days old has a hard lump about the size of a pea in a pointy shape and it does not move i cannot move it , it is mainly made out of bone as what i think. on his right side there is no such bony lump.

It occurs commonly and usually small in size. Pineal cysts are mostly benign and so usually ignored. Treatment is usually required in rare situations where the cyst has grown in size and when it starts to hinder the functions of other parts of the brain. Sometimes it becomes symptomatic. Usually due to increase in size and pressing onto other parts of the brain. Symptoms range in severity from nausea, severe headaches, seizures to coma. Large cysts can also cause visual problems.

Treatment depends on the magnitude of the problems caused. Appropriate hydration with adequate amount of fluids is very essential Cetain medicines may be given to bring down the toxic effect of calcium on the kidneys, liver and heart.

He is losing salt and water by vomiting and unless those are replenished, he would soon be suffering from dehydration and so you should intervene immediately and need not wait to be concerned after dehydration sets in. You need to give the child Oral Rehydration Solution (ORS). Mix a full sachet of ORS in a litre of water and give it sip by sip frequently. Also give half a tablet of Ondem MD 4mg thrice daily before food or as per requirement, to reduce the vomiting.

After assessing the present scenario the doctor would be better able to comment on how to ensure a healthy nail."},{"Patient":"16 month old fell hard when walking and hit forehead on wood floor two days ago. Has a bruise but acting normal since. This morning he woke up with fever, has thrown up and is lethargic. Fever goes up to 103.5 and goes down with Tylenol but goes back up before next dose. Could fever be from head injury?","Doctor":"The history of falling is probably unrelated to the feverishness and lethargy. But pain from the fall could have some relation. Moreover, vomiting even 2 days after a fall raises concerns about head injury.It is likely that he is suffering from a viral infection independant of his fall. If fever does not get controlled with tylenol, you may give Meftal P (mefenamic acid) which is more effective in controlling fever. It is better to visit a pediatrician and get him investigated since he is lethargic."},{"Patient":"Hi I m battling with my 5year old son with a heavy yellow postnasal drip - coughing non stop - he is currently on celestamine without any success (almost five days 5ml 3 times a day) - mybulen tablets - is it save to give him half a tablet at night ?","Doctor":"Mybulen contains Ibuprofen, Paracetamol and Codeine and is safe to be given to a child of 5 years suffering from postnasal drip and can be given safely at night or any time of the day. The codeine in the syrup will help in reducing the cough. Please visit a doctor to evaluate if he needs other treatment modalities like nebulisation or certain other medications."},{"Patient":"my baby having uti. {E-COLI} possitive so, treated with oral antibiotic syr. augmentine. during uti he had a cold dr s suggest to give syr.cetrizine. now he developed cough and cold because, i though syr augmentine i kept in frige. before giving medicine only we keep the medicine out after 10or 15 mints only we will give. and they adviced to give syr azee od 3days, now the antibiotic course over. still he have sever cough. what do? i can give asthalin nebulization in home. but he is ok active .mainly he is not taking food properly.","Doctor":"Asthalin is a bronchodilator and is safe and often essential in persistent cough. Such cough commonly occurs due to viral infection where antibiotics are ineffective and hence he has not recovered yet. You can give asthalin nebulisation at home but you would need a nebuliser device. Alternatively, you can give steam inhalation on one hand and asthalin inhaler through spacer device and the combination will serve the same purpose.It is common for children not to eat well if they are not in proper health. However, since the child is otherwise active, I would not worry."},{"Patient":"I get sharp pains everywhere in my stomach .

He said he doesn t feel good but he isn t running fever. The nose bleed came out of the blue and was hard to stop. Is there any connection between the two and should I be concerned?","Doctor":"Your child could have developed a bleeding diathesis which happens when there is problem in clotting of the blood. This could have led to aggravation and possibly bleeding of a gastric ulcer as well as bleeding from the nose. So, these could be related. Rather than trying to find the cause and correlation, just rush the child to emergency and get the situation managed."},{"Patient":"hello, my son is 13 and in the last 3_4 days complaining about pinching pain all over his stomach, ( sometimes left side, sometimes middle,ect)not constant also not always in same place. having diarrhea also and said sometimes a headache? started Friday morning calling his doctor in the morning, but still worried. asked what pain level between 1_10 said 5","Doctor":"Your child is probably complaining of abdominal colic which can be associated with diarrhoea due to contraction of muscles of the bowel. The headache is probably due to weakness and loss of solutes.Give the child decolic, ORS and naproxen and he would get relief."},{"Patient":"My son 4 years old has gallstone of 5 mm size. It was accidently discovered 1yr back during sonography. I got the scan done twice to confirm it. He is not having any discomfort due to it (No pains). I want to know following things: 1. How severe is the problem i.e. 4 yr child with 5 mm gallstone. 2. Since there is no pain as of now will it be recommended to do the surgery and remove out the gallbladder. 2. Is it advisable to use Homeopathic medicine, since the medicine may try to expel the stone and may block the duct. 3. Is there any homeopathic medicine which only tries to dissolve the gallstone (and not to expel it)? 4. Chances of further growth of stone or development of new stones and is homeopathic medicine helpful in preventing it.","Doctor":"Many of us, even in adulthood, have gall stones and never come to know about them unless incidentally while investigated for something else. It may remain there without ever causing any problems. So, I would say:1. The problem is not severe until the child develops pain when immediate action would need to be taken.2. No surgery required if he does not have pain. Please note that some surgeons might prefer to get it removed. I do not think that is required.2b. Homeopathic medicines not advised3. I would not suggest you to try to get the gall stones dissolved. For all practical purpose, they would not dissolve. The composition of the stones may vary. It may be pigment stones or calcium oxalate stones or certain other things. Even if there was a medicine to dissolve one, it would not work on the others.4. You need not bother about the growth of stones. All you need to bother is that in case ever a pain develops, just rush the child to a hospital with surgical emergency. You need not try to find medicines to stop the growth of the stones. Had there been such a medicine, surely enough you would not have given it to the child throughout his life."},{"Patient":"Hello,I have a seven week old baby, for the last couple of days she has been having yellowish/greenish stool with white little stringy things in her stool. I am not quite sure if this is normal. She has gotten eczema recently, so I'm not sure if that has something to do with it.","Doctor":"Eczema does not cause greenish stools in kids and I do not find any association. Greenish stools occur due to rapid transit of faecal matter through the large intestine and is normal in babies of such an age. Probably you are giving formula feeds, at least partly, and since they are hard to digest, often white portions are present in the stool. It is normal too.

Please help. Thank you, doc.","Doctor":"Probably you are suffering from common cold which is basically a viral infection. There are a number of viruses that could cause this. Antibiotics are ineffective in such infections. Even if it is streptococcal sore throat, irrespective of the use of antibiotics, it will take 5-7 days to go away. Just take steam inhalation and gurgle with lukewarm water and you will get relief. Also take some antiallergic like levocetirizine. It will help in reducing the sneezing.

Generally steristrips, dermafix strips or dermabond glue is used to appose the skin properly. The healing occurs spontanously without leaving much scar if the apposition is proper. If the steristrips get peeled off, you would have to assess, how much healing has already occurred. If the wound has already closed reasonably and there seems less chances of gaping, you need not worry and can leave it like that.

I think he is recovering from a viral illness and suggest you to stop all drugs and he will get better by himself.Regards - Dr. Sumanth"},{"Patient":"My daughter is 13 and has unexplained weakness in her right hand.

My 4 year old daughter had a rised temperature rapid breaking and was very tired she woke a couple of times and one time she woke she had two or three sudden jerky movements involuntary.

She had capol this.morning and now seems fine. And no sign of fever or temperature.","Doctor":"HI...as you classically describe the movements as -  very much like the moment we all have when you just dose off and suddenly wake up as if you were made to jump - I feel this is benign sleep myoclonus and it is common for some kids while going to sleep and while coming out of sleep. If she has not lost her conscious and there is no signs of limb weakness, you need not worry.But if this becomes repetitive, then I suggest you consult your pediatrician.Regards - Dr. Sumanth"},{"Patient":"My daughter is 6 years 7 months old, she was bitten by a street dog today.

I find nothing to worry with him as there is no fever, no vomiting and no signs of sickness. So please do not worry about such frequency of stools.2. I would only suggest you to continue breast feeding and give more liquids during day such as coconut water, rice water, lemon water, etc. Please avoid fruit juices and cold drinks if possible. You can give him ORS also if he accepts it (Some babies may not accept it because of its taste).3. If diarrhea persists or worsen, I would suggest you his stool examination in laboratory as well as consultation of a pediatrician. In that case supplementation with zinc and probiotics may also be helpful.Hope above suggestions will be helpful to you.Should you have any further query, please feel free to ask at HCM.Wish your baby the best of the health ahead.Thank you & Regards."},{"Patient":"When my granddaughter was born she went twelve minutes without breathing.

Does he feel breathless when she runs around or plays with other kids?4. Are the symptoms when there are seasonal changes?5. Is there any family history of asthma or any other sort of allergies like skin allergy etc.?6.

Once it starts it will take 5-7 days to completely get better. Unless the kid's having low urine output or very dull or excessively sleepy or blood in motion or green bilious vomiting...you need not worry. There is no need to use antibiotics (Zoxakind) unless there is blood in the motion. Antibiotics might worsen if unnecessarily used causing antibiotic associated diarrhoea.I suggest you use zinc supplements (Z&D drops 1ml once daily for 14 days) & ORS (Each small packet mixed in 200ml of potable water and keep giving sip by sip) as hydration is very important and crucial part of treatment. If there is vomiting you can use Syrup Ondansetron as prescribed by your paediatrician.Regards - Dr. Sumanth"},{"Patient":"Hi Doctor, My baby shireesh is 11 months old & from past 5 days he has loose motion.

Usually rather than fever, what is more important is the activity of the child, in between 2 fever episodes on the same day. If the kid is active and playing around when there is no fever, it is probably viral illness and it doesn't require antibiotics at all.Once viral fever comes it will there for 4-7 days. So do not worry about duration if the kid is active.Paracetamol can be given in the dose of 15mg/kg/dose every (According to the prescription) 4-6th hourly that too only if fever is more than 100F. I suggest not using combination medicines for fever, especially with Paracetamol.Meftal contains Mefenamic acid which is a NSAID. It carries the risk of gastritis and renal problems in the long run. Please do not use Meftal. I have published a paper on - the ill effects of mefenamic acid.

Was the right middle lobe involved more than once? c. Does he have fever every time when he has respiratory symptoms? or respiratory symptoms may present without fever also? d. Did he ever require nebulization? if yes, how many times? e. Has he ever had atopic dermatitis or urticaria? f. Does he have repeated stomach/stool problems (diarrhea/constipation/pain)? g. Does he have anyone in family with allergies? h. Is he routinely exposed to smoke/air pollution/dusts? i. Does he have repeated regurgitation/nausea/vomiting after taking hot/spicy foods/heavy meals?Above information would help me to know about your child better and therefore to suggest further investigations.2. At present, I am thinking of two possibilities: a. allergic respiratory disorder b. repeated infectionsAs his weight is 16 kg (appropriate for age, except if he has significant weight loss recently), I am not thinking of any serious disorder at present. But of course, diagnosing the cause of repeated respiratory symptoms is important.3. Were I treating him, after detailed history taking, I would suggest him allergy testing and some tests for immune system (if history suggests possibility of repeated pneumonia/infections). Allergy testing will help you identify the substances causing him allergies and also to know the measures to avoid them.4. In general, I would suggest you to avoid exposure to dusts, smokes and air pollution as much as possible for him.Hope above suggestions will be helpful to him.Should you have any further query, please feel free to ask at HCM.Thank you & Regards."},{"Patient":"unexplained vomiting from a 8 year old boy at least 4 times a month.

I have no problem urinating.","Doctor":"A shifting pain starting in the lower back shifting to the abdomen and then to the lower abdomen is usually an indication of urinary stones.You should check  your urine routine  and ultrasound scan to see if you have renal stones.A boring discomfort or pain may be due to hydronephrosis which can be due to a stone blocking your ureter.You need to do a ultrasound to find out if it is a serious condition like the above mentioned or just due to dyspepsia"},{"Patient":"hi there, my 15 month old son has been having regular loose, sour smelling stools for the past couple of months. He's otherwise really well, gaining weight, happy, playful and excellent appetite. He had a stool taken last week which came back all clear for any infections etc. The GP is not too concerned as he is happy and well. I have cut out cows milk and yogurts which seemed to make a slight difference. the runny/loose stools are not every time he has a bowel movement, but are quite regular and always sour smelling. Also hes been cutting his back teeth and now his incissors for past couple of months, could it just be because hes teething?Thank you in advance","Doctor":"I have gone through the details. Let me assure you that for a child of this age, passing stool a few times a day of somewhat loose consistency is absolutely normal and you need not worry about it. Since the child is otherwise healthy, playful and gaining weight steadily, you need not be concerned. That is the reason your GP was not concerned. You have done a good thing by removing the milk from diet as it is optional anyway but please include curd or yogurt as it is beneficial. Curd contains beneficial bacteria which will help in reducing the other bacteria of the gastrointestinal tract that are responsible for the foul smelling stools. Since the stool examiniation is othewise ok, you need not worry about that too. However, you need not think that the stool odour would grossly improve. You need not worry about the grinding of teeth. It is normal too."},{"Patient":"Hello Doctor,My son is 7 yrs old. From last Friday that is 31st Jan, we have noticed, he started coughing when he goes to bed at night. He doesn't cough the entire day and it only happens when he lie-down in bed. The same thing is happening for last few day and we are pretty much concerned.Doctor advised, Duolin + Budecort, we understand Budecort is steroid, is it advisable to take these medicine. The other medicine advised by doctor is Budesol, I think that’s also is a steroid. What is the difference between Budecort and Budesol, should we administer this medicine, are they ok for children of 7 yrs.Thanks","Doctor":"Your child is probably suffering from a viral infection for which your doctor is rightly treating. It is not unusual to have the cough increase at night but remain fine throughout the day. Please continue the present treatment and things should gradually improve.Duolin contains a combination of Salbutamol and Ipratropium Bromide, both of which are bronchodilators and help in reducing the spasm that causes wheezing. Budecort contains budesonide which is a steroid and needs to be given in order to reduce the reaction that causes the bronchospasms. Budesal contains salbutamol along with budesonide and so has both the effects of duolin and budecort. Moreover, budecort and budesal are two different brands marketed by two different pharmaceutical companies.You should administer the medicine as directed by your doctor. It is a very common medicine and a lot of children get this medicine without any complications. So you need not worry."},{"Patient":"I have a friend who has a 2 year old daughter.  She has all the symtoms of Pyloric Stenosis.  I know for babies, there treatment is sometimes surgery to correct the opening of the muscle.  what is the treatment for a child that age if that's what she has?","Doctor":"Pyloric stenosis is a condition generally present at birth but can go unnoticed or uncorrected even upto a few years of age. It generally presents with recurrent vomiting following feeds since the feed cannot pass into the next part called duodenum. However, I would strongly insist that you do not jump to any conclusions and get her examined by a doctor. There can be a number of diseases presenting with the same symptoms.If it is diagnosed to be pyloric stenosis, the treatment is very simple but surgical. The treatment is same as in case of a newborn, i.e. a small nick on the muscle of the pylorus to release the constriction and correct the opening."},{"Patient":"My 5 year old daughter has been running a high temperature for 3 days. As high as 39.5. We have seen Doctor today who has said possible viral infection, or water infection. She has had one dose of trimethoprim and up to 5 hours ago a high temperature still, we have treated this with paracetamol and ibuprofen as advised. She has been asleep for 4 hours and now has a temperature of 34.3. What should I do?","Doctor":"Viral infections are pretty common in children. Since it is not caused by bacteria, antibiotics are ineffective. Viral infections resolve spontaneously in 5-7 days even without the use of antibiotics. Treatment is supportive. All you have to do is to bring down the fever by the use of paracetamol or ibuprofen. You may give some antiallergic syrup like levocetirizine for a few days. Please rest assured that things would soon be fine and you need not worry."},{"Patient":"My husband just prepared a bottle using premade formula that he found in the fridge.  However, I believe that this formula was opened more than a week ago.  Once I realized what had happened, I dumped the bottle and open formula and started to nurse her.  I am not sure if I should I be concerned. Are there any risks/warning signs that I should watch for?","Doctor":"I have gone through the details and understand the cause of your concern. A premade formula was stored without maintaining proper sterility, there are chances of bacterial overgrowth but generally it will cause curdling of the formula milk which you would have easily noticed. Since that was not the case, I hope you can relax and there is no cause of concern. Diarrhoea or vomiting are signs to look out for but if these do not occur, you may rest assured that things are just fine."},{"Patient":"Can I give my 8 year old niece Vicks NyQuil cold and flu nighttime relief?

So that's the only other thing I have girl her to take.","Doctor":"NyQuil can safely be given to a child of 8 years. However, I do not recommend the use of such a medicine as it contains Dextromethorphan which is a cough suppressant. Instead I would prefer some expectorant. Steam or humidifier acts as a good expectorant. The water vapour will help in diluting the steam and will provide relief. That should be sufficient. However, you may add some antiallergic syrup like Relent (cetirizine) one teaspoonful twice a day for a few days."},{"Patient":"What will happen to my 6 yr old niece, she swallowed an AAA battery a few days ago and only told us last night. We are still not sure if it even is true or not, she is complaining of a little pain in her tummy but that is all. Her mother is gone into the hospital with her now for an X ray.","Doctor":"Swallowing a battery might be quite a risky thing. The outer shell of the battery may get eaten up by the gastric acids and the corrosive contents of the battery may get released leading to complications. The tummy ache might or might not be indicative of something ongoing in this respect. Her mother has done the right thing by taking her for a x ray. Based on the findings in the x ray and the location of the battery (if it is found to have been ingested), the doctor would be able to tell if you can wait for it to be safely passed out with stool or if some emergency procedure needs to be done for its removal."},{"Patient":"My 17 month old is having cold sweats, his hands are feet are cold and clammy and he has soaked through his clothes in the last 48 hours with sweat. He doesn t have a consistent fever and his temp keeps changing.

I suggest you see a doctor immediately. Meanwhile for monitoring him, you can assess his urine output and intake. if both are poor, then you need to see a physician immediately.Regards - Dr. Sumanth"},{"Patient":"Hi dr, my four years daughter is suffring from cough, cold, fiver n Wheezing, after diagnose the dr prescribe, monocef o syrup, alex syrup, recofast syrup n Montek lc kid, also Suggest for nebulize with asthalin N budecort, i just want to know is this right treatment or you will suggest better?","Doctor":"Hi...by what you quote, I think your daughter seems to be having either a viral associated wheeze or a multi triggered wheeze and I do not see the necessity of an antibiotic (Monocef-O) here.

She is suffering from pain in the abdomen and the back for the past 4 months. We had consulted a doctor in March, 2010 & she advised us to take a scan of the abdomen. We took a scan and she verified the same. She advised that my mom has some problem in her uterus. She told that a small skin had grown in the abdomen and that need to be operated. But at present it is not severe and so she gave some tablets for my mother's health to improve. She felt better after that.But last week again she got pain and we consulted another doctor as the first doctor was not available. She advised immediate operation of the appendicitis. But we were not convinced and waited for the first doctor's advise. Last Friday we got an appointment and visited her. She has advised us to take another scan as the old one was taken 4 months back. As my mother has some personal commitments in the coming months she may not be ready for the operation. Also she is not mentally ready for the operation. She will be free only by the month of October. So we seek your advise on the above problem as to whether we need to go for the operation or wait for a few months?","Doctor":"If pain in abdomen can be managed with medicines only, then it is good You need not to go for operation.

She had altogether 2 doses of it. fever came down from 104 to 100.5 But now again i checked it was 102. What should i do now? Should i give her parcetamol +Ibugesic plus medication now?","Doctor":"Hi....Fever of few days without any localizing signs could as well a viral illness. Usually rather than fever, what is more important is the activity of the child, in between 2 fever episodes on the same day. If the kid is active and playing around when there is no fever, it is probably viral illness and it doesn't require antibiotics at all. Once viral fever comes it will there for 4-7 days. So do not worry about duration if the kid is active.Paracetamol can be given in the dose of 15mg/kg/dose every 4-6th hourly that too only if fever is more than 100F. I suggest not using combination medicines for fever, especially with Paracetamol.You can give paracetamol 650mg 1/2 tablet for her weight.Regards - Dr. Sumanth"},{"Patient":"Hi, My baby is 16 months old is suffering from cold for the last 2 days and is not comfortable in sleeping as her nose gets blocked.

I just read through your questions. cold symptoms are very common in this age group. The best way to make her comfortable is to use saline nose drops prior to bedtime. If she is unable to blow her nose, as most 16 month olds are, you can use a rubber or plastic bulb syringe to suck out the mucous, approximately 5 minutes after inserting the nose drops. This will clear the nasal passages and make her more comfortable. Inhalers are not necessary.

This happens when the baby sucks at the breast or nipple of bottle very fast and in eagerness to drink milk will gulp in air too.

I know its difficult and the baby will initially struggle a lot, but it is needed as a permanent solution for the problem.2. To deflate his tummy you can turn him on to his tummy and tap his back lightly till his flatus comes out.

I am very concerned and seeking your help to understand the situation.","Doctor":"Hi...by what you quote this seems to be a type of seizure called complex partial seizure (CPS) or generalized tonic clonic seizures. This is not related to wheeze or its related medications. As it has occurred for the first time, without anybody in the family having it, he definitely needs evaluation. He will need an basic blood work up and EEG and MRI brain. Nothing to worry, if he is stable now. The tests will throw light upon the probable cause and then the doctors will be in a better to counsel you on further proceedings and prognosis.

From Shamir","Doctor":"Hello Shamir,Thank you for asking at HCM.Diet & nutrition is very important in childhood and I would like to make suggestions for your daughter as follows:1. It is not that some diets are healthy and some are less healthy. The importance is BALANCED DIET.Your daughter should receive adequate amounts of a. Carbohydrates (whole grains, fresh fruits, milk & products, sugar-jaggery etc)b. Proteins (nuts & beans, milk-curd-paneer, egg, etc)c. Fats (oils, butter, ghee, fats, etc)d. Vitamins & minerals (green leafy vegetables, fresh fruits, milk, etc)e. Fibres (green leafy vegetables, fresh fruits, etc)2. Practically, to meet above balance, I would suggest your daughter to get equal amounts of food from 4 groups - a. whole grains & cereals b. nuts & seeds, eggs c. vegetables d. fruits plus a small amount of dairy each dayThis usually meets the daily demand. For exact calculation of her requirements and perfect diet management, a consultation with a dietitian would help better.3. In my opinion, breast  feeding should be continued at least up to 2 years of age.4. There are many causes of \\"not eating properly\\" like anemia, vitamins-mineral deficiencies, constipation, gastroesophageal reflux, emotional disturbances, etc. It is important to identify and treat the cause rather stopping breastfeeding in order to increase food intake. Stopping breastfeeding will not solve your problem.5. Developmentally, 1.5 year is also an age when children like to have \\"choice\\" for foods, they don't like to be forced for feeding. So please do not force her for foods and only offer her a variety of foods with love.6. I would suggest as few as most of the packed foods, canned foods, outside foods, cold drinks, etc as they may contain variety of chemicals, preservatives, colors and additives.Hope above suggestions will help you.Wish your daughter the best of the health ahead.Thank you & Regards."},{"Patient":"Hello Doc, My one year old baby boy is been suffering irregular bowel movements. my doc advised me to do a stool routine analysis the report is as follows Colour : Yellow Consistency : Semi Loose Pus Cells :2-3 RBC : 1-2 Ova : Not seen Cysts : Not seen Parasites Not seen Stool Reducing Substances -Negative Stool Occult Blood -Positve.

As your doctor has examined your baby, I would suggest you to complete the antibiotics as suggested by him, although most commonly such infections are viral and antibiotics do not help much.3.

Diluting the cow milk is better than giving in undiluted form. There is no substitute for mother's milk. A child of this age may pass stool once in 10 days or 10 times a day and both are normal.

As your neighbour suspected, lower right quadrant abdominal pain with fever is a feature of appendicitis. If you continue to have this pain, fever with or without vomiting, you need to go the ER to rule out appendicitis. Other possible causes could be an intestinal infection, diverticulitis, a referred pain (source being the renal system). I hope you are better when you receive this answer. But if you are in distress, you need to visit your doctor at the earliest. Routine blood counts, ultrasound examination and urine microscopy are entailed. Hope this is helpful. Wish you speedy recovery Regards"},{"Patient":"My 13 yr daughter has had episodes of epigastric pain for about 9 months... Dr assumed classic gall bladder pain symptoms... She had endoscopic ultrasound yesterday... Gallbladder, pancreas and ducts all normal... Only thing noted subcenter portal lymph node appears reactive to inflammation could this have any significance to possible pain episodes","Doctor":"There are two possibilities that I would consider. The most probable cause is gastritis. Give her omeprazole in the morning for one and a half months. Give small but frequent meals. I hope that her pain would be relieved.The other possibility is some non specific gastrointestinal infection which could also be behind the inflamed lymph nodes. It could be related and a possible cause of the abdominal pain. A simple course of antibiotics like ofloxacin will be enough."},{"Patient":"Hi, I got 21 months boy baby. he born in India but, now we are in U.S. myself dark complexion, my husband is wheatish color. my boy face looks little fair but, body is in dark. what to use for his skin complexion? can u please suggest me some soaps or lotions and creams for his fairness?","Doctor":"Skin lightening is practically a myth and do not fall for it. You cannot ultimately make it lighter. It has a genetic component and you cannot change that. No soaps, lotions or creams are likely to be effective. At the most you can use sunscreen lotions when you take the baby out. Just maintain a healthy lifestyle and a proper diet and things would be at its best."},{"Patient":"Hello Dr. Rynne my child was diagnosis with pelviectasis I didnt not get factual info has what cause s this & can it be treated permanently also how to prevent this from recurring, if possible I am just needing to know will this cause serious kidney issue s thanks.","Doctor":"Hydronephrosis, also known as pyelectasis or pelviectasis, is the presence of extra fluid in a fetus's kidney or kidneys. It is generally caused due to a blockage along the baby's urinary tract, making urine backflow into the kidneys and making it dilated in the process. It may hamper kidney function and even render it ineffective unless steps are taken to relieve the obstruction. If the obstruction is removed, there is less chance of recurrence. However, the damage already done may not be undone. Recurrence in case of your subsequent baby is unrelated and you need not worry about it."},{"Patient":"The age of my child is 3 yrs.He is suffering from fever since last 7 days. last day doctor has prescribed an antibiotic medicine named CLAMP-KID,FORTE,suspension.But even after taking that medicine (already 3 does with 12 hrs interval) temperature of my child rise around 101.5 F to 102 F. At that time I am giving Febrinil syrup.Preliminary clinical test have been made but no tangible anomaly have seen. Is any alternative antibiotic for the same. I need suggestion as early as possible.Thanks & Regards Saikat Majumder West Bengal Kolkata.","Doctor":"Since the reports are normal, as you mention, probably the cause is a viral infection. Viral infections in children are very common and are often associated with high rise of temperature. Antibiotics are ineffective but since you have started it, I would insist you to complete the course. No alternative antibiotics required. Just continue febrinil which contains paracetamol which will help in bringing down the temperature. Steam inhalation would be helpful. Give plenty of curd. In 5-7 days things generally return to normal. If not, get blood tests done to rule out typhoid."},{"Patient":"hello My son is 16 months old weight is 10 kg. He vomits daily after his night meal.

Regards shivanibector","Doctor":"Weight of 10 kg is low for a child of 16 months even though it depends on the birth weight. Try eliminating wheat based products from the diet for at least 2 weeks and see if there is improvement. Also remove milk and milk based items from the diet. You can give curd. Give small but frequent meals. Give fibre rich diet including green leafy vegetables. You may add isabgol at dinner time.

We went to his Dr and he said he thinks it s he s still working through a virus. Just wondering how long is too long for these symptoms to be going on.","Doctor":"I do not think that it is due to a virus. To me it seems more like gastro-esophageal reflux and improper peristalsis. Give a high fibre diet including green leafy vegetables which will help in regularising the bowel movements which are actually responsible for taking the food down gradually. In his case, the reverse is occurring. Regular play habits and exercise is equally essential. With that, the symtoms should gradually subside.

Aavin or any other milk substitutes that are generally given, are based on cow milk and are difficult for the baby to digest, moreso if the baby was born preterm. NAN Pro 1 has certain nutrients added and removed to make it more like human milk and hence is suited better. Diluted aavin would be better than the normal one as the concentration of certain nutrients would be closer to human milk. Although external feeds cannot cause fever, sterility cannot often be maintained properly and hence becomes possible source of infection causing diarrhoea or fever.

Personally I prefer paracetamol over ibuprofen for fever in flu or flu-like infections. The reason is better safety profile. If fever does not respond to paracetamol, then only I would suggest you ibuprofen.Also I would suggest tepid sponging for fever in addition to medicines.2. I would also suggest him a cough syrup containing an antihistamine (like pheniramine) and decongestant (phenylephrine). It will take care of other symptoms like cold and to some extent, cough.3. Maintenance of hydration and rest is very important in viral infections. Please ensure that your child is taking plenty of fluids during the day. I would suggest you to offer him oral fluids frequently.4. During a viral infection, it is very common to have loss of appetite. Please do not force your child food. Let him/her take according to appetite and continue to offer him fluids in between.5. Viral infections usually take 5-7 days to resolve. If he develops any new symptom, fever continues or increases or does not respond, I would suggest you to consult a pediatrician who will examine her and also will suggest him tests to look for infections other than viral infections.Hope above suggestions will be helpful to you.Should you have any further query, please feel free to ask at HCM.Wish your child a very good recovery and a very good health ahead.Thank you & Regards."},{"Patient":"my 2 year old has garlic breath, yet doesnt eat any garlic. have noticed this for a week or so?! the web has me freaked that it is arsenic or organic phosphate poising because apparently those are the top causes of this garlic smell ........

Your doctor probably has given it to prevent deep vein thrombosis. However it is pregnancy category D and not safe. A safe alternative is clopidogrel.

I need suggession.","Doctor":"Hi. You already know the detailed diagnosis, which surely must have been told to you by a proper qualified person (a doctor)! Here goes my assessment and suggestion: You seem to be suffering from a chronic anal fissure. Any form of conservative (i.e. non-surgical) treatment is unlikely to work at this stage; and I am sure you must have tried all sorts of them by now. At this stage, surgery seems to be the only option left for you. Lateral internal sphincterotomy (the name of the surgical procedure) is a 'minor' operation (even if the name is slightly lengthy!) with ~ 95% of success rate. The sentinel pile can also be excised easily at the same time. Thanks."},{"Patient":"My daughter is 1 1/2 yr old. She has severe nose block during last night.

Can we give her nebulization since she is breathing  with mouth ?","Doctor":"Hello,Thank you for asking at HCM.I went through your daughter's history and would like to make suggestions for her as follows:1. For nose block, I would suggest her saline nose drops regularly and frequently to open her nose. I would also suggest her use of a decongestant drops like xylometazoline (Pediatric preparation) strictly not more than 3 days. 2. If she has nose symptoms like running nose, sneezing, etc, I would also suggest her an antihistamine like cetirizine or levocetirizine for 5-7 days.3. If she has allergies, removal of allergy causing substances from her environment is very important.4. She is breathing through mouth because her nose is blocked. Nebulization should not be given for mouth breathing.Nebulization should only be given on your doctor's advise after examining her chest carefully with stethoscope.5. If above measures do not improve her nose block, I would suggest her nose to be examined by an ENT specialist so that cause of nose obstruction can be known.Hope above suggestions will be helpful to you.Should you have any further query, please feel free to ask at HCM.Wish your daughter the best of the health ahead.Thank you & Regards."},{"Patient":"My daughter is 3 years old.

Is it ok?","Doctor":"The burping could be due to diaphragmatic irritation. Try giving liofen and see if there is relief.The dry cough is probably due to a viral infection. Continue giving lanzol junior tablet or sachet to reduce the acidity. You will have to use paracetamol to reduce the temperature. The vomiting is unlikely to be due to hyperacidity but the possiblility of gastric irritation due to the medicines cannot be ruled out.I would not suggest koflet. Give some antiallergic like levocetirizine instead. Give steam inhalation. Water in the form of vapour will reach deep into the lungs and help in diluting the cough."},{"Patient":"My 5 year old daughter has been experiencing bursts of nausea since last night without vomiting. She has an appetite and has been eating and drinking. She suddenly becomes pink, then pale and feels like vomiting. It subsides after a few seconds.

PERL s stain for iron: iron stores reduced.","Doctor":"You have not mentioned the complaints for which the tests were done. Most commonly lymphocytosis occurs in viral infections but could also occur in chronic infections like tuberculosis. The treatment depends upon the cause which can be determined only after considering the clinical symptoms.

Ive given her diluted apple juice and 1% milk. Same brands as always. No fever. She coughs it up or burps it out.. What is happening?","Doctor":"Probably your child is suffering from acute gastroenteritis or a gastro intestinal infection. Give her plenty of fluids and ORS but avoid milk for the time being. It is common for children not to eat properly when ill. Give ondem (ondansetron) to reduce vomiting. You would have to be a bit patient and it will take two to three days to resolve.

Antibiotics are not required. Give paracetamol to bring down temperature if present. Like many viral infections it is associated with skin rashes. Small pox is already eradicated and you probably mean chicken pox. Since your doctor has already examined it, I think that there is more possibility of his being right. In any case, you would have to be a bit patient and wait for it to resolve spontaneously.

Motrin (Ibuprofen) should be given only if tylenol is not effective in reducing temperature. Children's cough syrup need not be given as it can rather depress cough. Rather give some anti allergic syrup like levocetirizine as there is generally an allergic component involved. Give steam inhalation.

I do not know if it is best to remove the earring or not, and what I should do. Could it be an infection?","Doctor":"It is indeed due to a possible infection. Infection can be confirmed by increased pain, redness, swelling, heat, or tenderness around the piercing site or yellow-green pus-like discharge coming from the piercing site as in your case. By switching to gold, you have minimised the possible allergic reaction to metals. It would be reasonable to remove the ear-rings for the time being and also go for a course of oral antibiotics.

You haven't mentioned the duration and details of your present symptom viz. 'loose motion in the morning'. Anyway. Taking for granted a short duration of this problem (Maximum over a couple of weeks or so), it may have been caused by an endemic intestinal infection like amoebic colitis or subacute enteritis (viral) etc. It will be cured with appropriate treatment prescribed by your doctor. 2. If your tubercular disease has been treated adequately surgically+medically, and if your innate  immunity is good, then you will be able to live a normal life. However, there is a pitfall in this answer which needs to be discussed as you have not mentioned the exact segment of the intestine that was resected during surgery. If terminal ileum is resected, then malabsorption may result which in turn can lead to loose motions. You will be able to get this issue clarified easily from your physician/surgeon. Thanks.

It is due to rapid transit through large bowels and is not a cause of concern. The frequency of passing stool in a child could be once in 10 days as it could be 10 times  a day and both are normal. You do not need to worry so long as stool is not hard.Drooling is unrelated and probably not a cause of concern."},{"Patient":"12 year old child experiences high fever and chills. He also says that his heart feels like its pounding. Two weeks before these symptoms, the child fell off his bike and skinned his knee. This child also has a history of a heart murmur. What disease should be considered?","Doctor":"Viral infections are the commonest cause of fever in children. Palpitations are common during fever and increase in heart rate occurs with increase in temperature. The falling off a bike and associated injury 2 weeks back is probably unrelated. The murmurs are probably unrelated too but it is hard to comment without knowing the nature of murmur. I would suggest follow up with a cardiologist.The diseases to consider are viral and bacterial infections including typhoid.

Meftal spas is ok to relieve her abdominal discomfort. Such episodes of acute gastroenteritis generally get corrected in 3-5 days irrespective of use of antibiotics.

Giving protein enhanced diet is also a good option."},{"Patient":"my son has really foul smelling stools. What could be the issue besides possibly lactose intolerance & celiac disease? He is 7 years old. He had a upper GI endoscopy done a few years ago and at that time he was diagnosed with eosinophilic esophagitis and they also mentioned that he had lower than average lactase levels. His dairy intake is not excessive. He has a glass of milk in the morning or afternoon and occasionally pizza. I m concerned because although he has no other symptoms such as stomach discomfort or gas or bloating, his stools are really malodorous to the point where we have to have him change his underwear and shorts often for no other apparent reason. Please advise. Thank you!","Doctor":"The foul smelling stools could be due to overgrowth of certain bacteria in his intestines. A course of metronidazole thrice daily for 5 days should be helpful. Also give him plenty of curd. You may skip the glass of milk in the morning and give other nutritive food items instead.The primary manifestation of lactose intolerance would be bloating and abdominal distention which your child does not have.In case of coeliac disease, failure to grow properly and frequency of stool are generally present."},{"Patient":"Hi, may I answer your health queries right now ?

The causes of pain in the belly button and the area above can be infection in the area called Umbilical granuloma or can be an obstructed hernia.

I assessed this myself and it does indeed flare out significantly. What is the cause for this?","Doctor":"It seems to be associated with some amount of respiratory distress although it is hard to comment without examining physically. In case of a child, if the accessory muscles of respiration need to be active, it indicates respiratory distress which is also manifested by increase in rate of breathing. However, if it is transient, it could also be due to crying in pain where you need not worry. Please visit a pediatrician and get the child assessed depending on the situation."},{"Patient":"My baby is 6 maths old had bronchitis from last 9 days , coughing really badly on high pitch and also throws up once a day after his feed and also green thick slimey and mucus poop....is this normal and how long this can last , when can I see him recovering","Doctor":"It is probably bronchiolitis that you are talking about. It is common in children between 6 months and 3 years of age. It generally continues for 5 or 7 days. I would suggest giving the child steam inhalation if nebulisation is not feasible. I would insist you to keep the child in follow up of a pediatrician rather than wait for spontaneous recovery though it is likely to occur in about 7 days."},{"Patient":"hi my son is 3yrs 4mths old , he suddenly got a fever yesterday at around 7;30 pm n it didnt subside even after giving him calpol syrup . only after giving him imol syrup in the mornin today his temp. dropped to normal, but he has been grindin is teeth , can i deworm him today . plz advise","Doctor":"Bruxism or grinding of teeth is unrelated to worm infestation and could occur due to a number of harmless causes. However, it might be reasonable to deworm a child of this age on yearly basis with two doses of albendazole repeated at a fortnight interval.Most of the fevers in children are due to viral causes and does not need to be treated with antibiotics. Imon contains ibuprofen and paracetamol combination and is more effective than paracetamol (calpol) and if that too is not effective, you may try mefenamic acid (Meftal P) which is better in relieving temperature."},{"Patient":"Hello Doctor, My son is 2 years & 2 months old. He is having fever (101-102), cold & slight cough, since yesterday. I am giving panadol 9ml according to his weight, piriton 5ml twice a day, ataline 5ml twice a day. is it ok? should i see a doctor & start an antibiotic?","Doctor":"Panadol contains paracetamol which needs to be given in the dose of 15 mg/kg/dose at a minimum interval of 3-4 hours. It comes as syrup with 125 mg/5ml.Ataline contains Terbutaline and can be given in dose 0.05-0.075 mg/kg thrice daily.Had you mentioned the body weight of your child, I could have commented whether it is the right dose for him. You may calculate for yourself.The dose of piriton is fine for a child of this age.Most of such fevers are due to viral infections where antibiotics are not required.You may remain in regular follow up with your pediatrician but it does not seem urgent at the moment.Give the child steam inhalation."},{"Patient":"My four year old girl has a temp of 101.7. she is eating ok and drinking water. but she is complaining her front bottom two teeth hurt when she bites down.

Night sweat his pillow and shirt gets damp ... What do I do? Keep him covered or uncover him? Give him Tylenol?","Doctor":"Nasal blocks are common in children. Apply saline nasal drops like Nasoclear. If you think it is not effective, you may try Nasivion nasal drops.About his body feeling cold and moist at night, there is nothing to worry. Cover him partially such that the temperature inside the wrap is comfortable and at the same time air can flow.

How long can i wait to take him to a doctor?","Doctor":"Your child might be suffering from a gastrointestinal infection. Give him ORS to prevent dehydration. Ondem contains ondansetron which is effective in reducing nausea and vomiting. It can be given at 0.15 mg/kg dose given at interval of at least 3-4 hours (needs to be calculated based on body weight which you have not mentioned). A thrice daily regimen is reasonable for the time being.If the child becomes lethargic or dehydrated you would need to take him to a doctor. If you can continue replenishing the salt and water lost, things should be fine soon and you need not worry. The hydration status would be indicated by the frequency of passing urine."},{"Patient":"My 2 year old had a temp earlier in the week but was well in herself. A couple of hours ago she vomited twice and went to sleep shortly after. Her cheeks are flushed and body feels quite hot but showing no temp, however her forehead, nose and ears are almost icy to touch. Should I be worried?","Doctor":"Observe the child. She could have got a gastrointestinal infection which could manifest with rise of temperature at times and low temperature at other times. If the activity level of the child and the feeding is fine, you need not get worried. But if there the child becomes lethargic, you would need to take the child to a doctor and get her evaluated."},{"Patient":"Hi Doctor, We had our 7 month old son s stool examined because of his active bowel movement lately.

Second. We need to get him hospitalise. I just wanted to know what would be the best thing to do. Thank You.","Doctor":"Enatamoeba histolytica infection can be treated with some simple antibiotics which may be given in oral or intravenous form. Whether the child needs to be hospitalised depends on the hydration status. If there is dehydration, there is requirement of hospitalisation. But in case adequate ORS and fluids can be given orally, the option of treating at home with oral medication can be tried. However, if your pediatrician advises, hospitalisation may be a better idea as the gastrointestinal absorbtion of medicines might be a bit erratic in children of this age. The best thing depends upon your convenience and the actual situation."},{"Patient":"My 10 year old son has 12 or more red bumps on buttocks and thighs that look a little like insect bites, but are in various stages of size.

He goes 2 or 3 days without a bowel movement. When he does need to go, you can tell because he will go off by himself, sometimes sit on the floor cross legged. If you ask him if he needs to go to the bathroom, he hesitates. I am sure it s because each bowel movement is painful. I would say, about half of his bowel movements are large in size, like over 10 inches long. Like he is so bound up. Recently, he has been vomitting, so not real sure if this is from his bowels or because school started and he has been exposed to all the new school germs and illnesses.","Doctor":"Hi,It seems that he might be having absolute constipation giving this problem.Give him light purgative like miralx or crimaffin daily at night for few days.Give him plenty of water and more fiber containing food.If require go for enema to remove hard fecolith.Ok and take care."},{"Patient":"My two year old doberman pinscher (Cocoa) pees uncontrollably when she sleeps.

This is for a newly diagnosed child with chrons and a fistula. We took a one month course of flagil and saw a small improvement but it did not heal,the fistula completely. We are now starting cipro and will combine it with a liquid diet for 2 months to see if we can put him in remission.","Doctor":"The diet for Crohn's disease does not need to be liquid totally. I do not think that you need a purified baby food but had you mentioned the age, it would have been easier to suggest. It is important to follow a high-calorie, high-protein diet, even if he does not feel like eating. It is also important to keep the stool soft by use of high fibre diet and stool softners to prevent worsening of the fistula. I would not have recommended taking a month-long course of flagyl (metronidazole) or even ciprofloxacin. Please do not self medicate. Provide Sitz bath."},{"Patient":"My grand daughter (2yrs) cries when she cannot have what she wants and can work herself up into a sobbing state. Her parents tell me this is a panic attack and are afraid she is hyperventilating. How can you tell if this is just a tantrum or if she is indeed hyperventilating?","Doctor":"HelloDr.Ervis answeringTemper tantrums are emotional and physical \\"meltdowns\\" common among children in the 2- to 4-year-old age range. The toddler may demonstrate a number of characteristic behaviors, including screaming, kicking, lying on the floor, and occasionally holding her breath (rarely to the point of passing out). As a child matures, these manifestations of emotional, developmental, and physical immaturity gradually extinguish themselves. Studies indicate that 23%-85% of children between 2 and 4 years of age will commonly have temper tantrums.Children who still have tantrums after the age of 4 may need help learning to deal with their emotions. Tantrums that continue or start during the school years may be a sign of learning problems or other issues that the child may need help with.Some children have temper tantrums that last longer and are more severe than normal. They may destroy things or hurt themselves or other people. This violent behavior may be a sign of a more serious problem.If you sense that a tantrum is coming, you may be able to stop it.Distract your child. For example, if your child doesn't like to go to bed, talk about something fun that is going to happen the next day.Encourage your child to take a break from a frustrating activity. Or get your child to focus on something he or she already knows how to do.Remove your child from a situation that is likely to cause tantrums. Situations such as a large family dinner or the lights and noise of a carnival may be too much for a young child to handle.After a tantrum starts, ignoring it may work best. Try the following:Walk away. But stay where the child can see you, especially if your child is very young.Keep doing what you were doing. You can observe without focusing all of your attention on your child.Don't talk to the child, if possible. If you do speak, use a neutral tone of voice.After a tantrum is over:Praise your child for calming down.Acknowledge your child's feelings. You might say something like, \\"I know that you were upset because you couldn't tie your shoes.\\"Comfort your child without giving in to his or her demands.Never punish or make fun of a child who has a temper tantrum. Don't use words like \\"bad girl\\" or \\"bad boy\\" to describe your child.Teach other ways to handle anger and frustration. For example, encourage your child to use words to express feelings. Or set up a safe place in the home where your child can go to calm down.Be a good role model. Children learn by watching their parents, so let your child see that you can handle your own strong emotions calmly.If your child has a lot of tantrums, time-out may be an option. Time-out works best for children who can understand why it is being used. This is usually around age 2 or 3 years.For a time-out, you send or put your child someplace safe, such as a chair in a hallway, for a few minutes. This gives the child time to calm down. It also teaches the child that having a temper tantrum is not acceptable behavior."},{"Patient":"Hi my baby girl is 11 months old and weighs 8 kgs. She doesn't eat at all. I have been trying since she was 6 months old. For the last 15 days she has not been eating and not drinking her milk also. Her diet is 3 ounces of milk. Our pediatric suggested cypon drops. Should I give this or not?","Doctor":"HelloDr. Ervis answering your question.I don't find this medicine in the guidelines of recommendation.Your child needs some encouragement and structure from you when it comes to mealtimes (such as regular meals and healthy choices), but not much more. Your child may eat well one day and eat practically nothing the next.Rather than get hung up on the fact that your child has refused everything you put in front of her today, consider what she's eaten over the course of one week. Parents are often surprised to find that their child's food intake balances out. Something must be fueling all that energy!Don't forget to consider how much she drinks in the food equation, too. Milk and 100 percent juice can supply vital nutrients (though too much juice means too much sugar). But because drinking too much milk or juice can also dampen an appetite, you may want to serve drinks after and between meals, not right before. And don't let her fill up on sweets and junk food – her growing body needs the nutrients supplied by a healthy diet, not empty calories.Here are a few tips to help get through those bumpy patches:Offer a variety of healthy food choices and let your toddler feed herself. This way she gets to exercise a little independence.Don't threaten her or bargain with her. \\"One more bite and you get a cookie,\\" or, \\"No story time if you don't eat your peas,\\" makes mealtime into a power struggle. If you want to raise a healthy eater, keep mealtimes positive, and don't use sweets as a reward.Have meals as a family whenever possible. When your toddler sees you or her siblings eating healthy food, she's more likely to want to follow along.Don't take something off the menu if she doesn't like it. Kids are slow to accept new tastes and textures, so if she spits out green beans the first time, try making them again the following week. She may surprise you and decide they're her new favorite food. And be patient: You may have to offer a new food many times before she's willing to make it a regular part of her diet."},{"Patient":"Hi doctor, my kid 9 yrs 21 kg has been having high fever since today afternoon.

You could use again ibugesic 200 mg every 6-8 hours, 3 doses in 24 hours and between the medicine you could make your child a bath with warm water. Not with cold water as it will make the temp rise. When bathing with warm water take out a cup with warm water and put in a cup with cold water. so cool it down gradually. If fever persists more than 3 days with full 24 hours send him to the hospital it could be bacterial.

Had you mentioned the differential count and platelet count, it would have been easier to comment on the possible cause. Since the total leucocyte count is low, there is more likelihood for a viral infection. In such a case however band cell count is generally not high. The C-reactive protein level in blood would have given a better idea about possible infection. Let me mention that viral fevers are quite common in children and are associated with high temperature. Talk to your doctor and he would be able to guide you better.It is hard to comment about the possible cause of bump on head without examining. If the platelet count is normal, there is less likelihood of it being due to bleeding.

As he is trying to cough out the thick mucus, the gag is triggering a vomiting but not otherwise. Zyrtec (cetirizine) is an antiallergic which relieves the allergic component of such infections and should be given for a few days to relieve the khitch khitch. Give him steam inhalation or nebulisation if possible. The water in the form of vapour or fine particles will reach deep into the lungs and help in diluting the cough and give him relief.

But as it is increasing in size, it needs medical attention. It is not painful, so it is not harmful or serious. So do not worry. Probably it need to be removed and the histological examination will reveal its true identity. I suggest you see you surgeon or pediatric surgeon for this.Regards - Dr. Sumanth"},{"Patient":"Hi, I was wondering something. When I laugh, or go to the washroom, or anything that involves a push... I get this sharp pain in my lower left abdomen ... Where my intestines are. As soon as I feel that pain, I quickly refrain from the push because it hurts and it scares me. I don t get it every single time, but I do get it quite often. I am wondering, what this could possibly be? Thanks","Doctor":"Start a course of stool softeners and continue it for at least a week. Drink at least 2 litres of water per day. This will prevent you from straining while passing stools. If the pain disappears then its fine.

Greetings from Chennai, India.By what you quote I feel what your kid could be having viral associated wheeze or multi triggered wheeze. I have a few questions for you -Questions:1. How many days per month does she cough or feel breathless?2. How many nights per month does her sleep get disturbed due to above symptoms?3. Does she feel breathless when she runs around or plays with other kids?4. Are the symptoms when there are seasonal changes?5. Is there any family history of asthma or any other sort of allergies like skin allergy etc.?6. Is the cough always associated with fever?If your answer is yes for any of the above questions, your kid might be having viral associated wheezing or multi triggered wheezing and I suggest you meet a paediatric pulmonologist who is near your place.

What could be going on with him? Thanks","Doctor":"HI...This looks like a viral illness. Fever and neck pain is not related to constipation. But vomiting could be due to constipation. Fever of few days without any localizing signs could as well a viral illness. Usually rather than fever, what is more important is the activity of the child, in between 2 fever episodes on the same day. If the kid is active and playing around when there is no fever, it is probably viral illness and it doesn't require antibiotics at all. Once viral fever comes it will there for 4-7 days. So do not worry about duration if the kid is active.I suggest you give Paracetamol at the appropriate dose and plenty of fluids to drink.Regards - Dr. Sumanth"},{"Patient":"Well yesterday my 14 year old went to school and was fine.

Maxtra is an antiallergic and gives relief if given for a few days. Mucolite helps in diluting cough. I would prefer giving steam inhalation for the dilution of cough.

Get a urine test done. Also a scan of the abdomen is required to see if there is urinary stone. If there is stone then following management is done.Treatment is tailored according to the type of stone. Urine can be strained and stones collected for evaluation. Drinking six to eight glasses of water a day increases urine flow. People who are dehydrated or have severe nausea and vomiting may need intravenous fluids.Other treatment options include:1. MedicationPain relief may require narcotic medications. The presence of infection requires treatment with antibiotics.Other medications include:i. Allopurinol for uric acid stonesii. Diureticsiii. Sodium Bicarbonate or sodium citrateiv. Phosphorus solutions2. LithotripsyExtracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy uses sound waves to break up large stones so they can more easily pass down the ureters into your bladder. This procedure can be uncomfortable and may require light anesthesia. It can cause bruising on the abdomen and back and bleeding around the kidney and nearby organs.3. Tunnel Surgery (Percutaneous Nephrolithotomy)Stones are removed through a small incision in your back and may be needed when:i. The stone causes obstruction and infection or is damaging the kidneysii. The stone has grown too large to passiii. Pain cannot be controlled3. UreteroscopyWhen a stone is stuck in the ureter or bladder, your doctor may use an instrument called a ureteroscope to remove it. A small wire with a camera attached is inserted into the urethra and passed into the bladder. A small cage is used to snag the stone and remove it. The stone is then sent to the laboratory for analysis.Hope I have answered your query.

But rather than giving such formula milk, breast milk is the best alternative. The frequency of feeds should be 6-8 times a day, be it formula feed, breast milk or semi solids. The amount should be a few ounces initially and gradually increased to 8-10 ounces per feed or as the child tolerates. I would suggest you to continue to breast feed the baby upto at least 1 year of age along with the supplemental feeds that you have introduced. Gradually increase the frequency of the semi solids to 6-8 times a day. Cow milk is optional and not essential in case breast milk is inadequate."},{"Patient":"Hi, my 7 yr old has 6 small pimples around her anus. She is one of our 3 kids. All 3 kids have contagious mulluscum. We followed advice from our pediatrician and switched our kids to Antibacterial soap for cleanings. Do you think th red bumps are most likely the mulluscum or maybe an irritation from our new use of dial bar soap? What could I use on the bumps?

It only happens when he is playing and inhaling deeply and does not occur whe he is sleeping, eating, or awake. He does not have a fever, cough, or any other symptoms. I m not sure if it is just a new sound he has discovered or I should take him immiliatly to get checked.","Doctor":"Wheezing could occur due to narrowing of the respiratory tracts, what we call bronchospasm. If not due to cold, it could also occur due to exertion as during playing. But I would not consider it normal and would suggest you to consult a doctor who can examine the chest and may be also get an echocardiography done if he feels required (to rule out any congenital heart disease that could be a cause)."},{"Patient":"I have a toddler. we thought she had a virus, started with vomiting, low grade fever, acting normal, but lack of appetite , won t take fluids, pale stool, going on eight days. took to doctor, they were not able to get enough blood in vile to check liver. she was not hydrated enough, got enough blood to do a CBC, red & white cells good, enough iron, all was good. no jaundice, skin coloring good. where do you think we should go from here?","Doctor":"Thanks for the query.It may be viral illness or pyrexia of unknown origin.Pale stool if associated with vomiting may indicate, unicteric hepatitis.You need to do blood and urine culture.X ray chest and usg abdomen along with liver function test will also be required.Hope i help you."},{"Patient":"My daughter 2yrs is suffering from cough and fever for two days.

We give her SumoL DS 8ml but could not relieve. Kindly help .","Doctor":"Most of the fevers in children of this age are due to viral cause and do not need antibiotics. Same for sore throat. Since your doctor has felt it reasonable to give Azithral (azithromycin), please complete the course as prescribed. Sumol contains paracetamol 125mg/5ml. How much dose your child needs depends on the body weight which you have not mentioned. The dose is 15 mg/kg/dose given at a minimum interval of 3-4 hours. If fever is not relieved with Sumol, you may try Ibugesic plus or Meftal-P which are more effective in reducing fever."},{"Patient":"My son is 5months and 16days old and he was suffering from severe cough which is now reduced as the Doctor has put him on Augmentin Antibiotic and now he is normal, The doctor now has advised for Septillin syrup from Himalaya to be given for one month minimal which will help him increase immunity. Is it safe to give it to my baby. Please advice.","Doctor":"Most of the episodes of cough and cold are caused due to certain viruses. Antibiotics are generally not required but some doctors give antibiotics with the assumption of superadded bacterial infections which are sometimes present. Septilin is supposed to act as an immunomodulator and help in enhancing immunity but this demand is not backed by evidence. However, there should be no harm associated in giving septilin to a baby of this age."},{"Patient":"My son was born 12 days ago and for the last 2 days we are having problems with gas pains. He is being fed Similac sensitive which is intended for gas but is still suffering. He will cry for several hours at a time turning red in the face and tensing up his abdominal muscles passing gas every so often. I have tried massaging is belly and doing the bicycle leg motion which seem to help the gas pass but do not relieve the pain. Both parents have no known allergic reactions. I am wondering if giving him simethicone gas relief drops like Pediacare or Little Remedies or a product like Tummy Calm or Colic Calm would be safe? If he is awake and moving around after feeding there does not seem to be a problem with the gas, it is only when he is in his sleeping hours and doesn t get enough movement in to help push everything in the right direction. He was born 3 days late with no complications and is healthy.","Doctor":"Thank you for the query.It seems to be lactose intolerance. kindly pay attention to the timing of pain with feeding.Mother should be fed wholesome diet without chilies.Simethicone is quiet safe for some times but not to be used routinely.You can try putting baby on belly while sleeping it will help get rid of gases.It is still advisable to check with a pediatrician."},{"Patient":"Hi Dr., I m from Kerala.This is for my husband.His age is 26.He has been suffering from stomach pain for the last one year.He consult a Dr. and according to his instruction take a surgery for appendicitis on may 7th.But the pain still exists.Again we consult a Dr. and he said that my husband has Abdominal TB.He has weight loss .The stomach pain appears regularly within an interval of 5 -10 minutes.And it lasts only for 50 Seconds.But it is very painful.Is it is due to abdominal TB or any other disease?Please help us...","Doctor":"Hi.

That's why the name.Very sharp teeth push from inside gums to erupt. This lead to swelling of gums which may cause mild to moderate fever, rise of temperature of head and palms and feet,. These areas are well perfused (high blood flow) so help in reduce raised temperature.This causes irritation of gums thereby leading child to try to chew every thing (besides normal cephalo caudal development) and this may give the child intestinal infections.You may try paracetamol syrup with kind help of your pediatrician during these inflammatory stages.

Sometimes fluid can remain in the ear after the infection is gone, and sometimes this can lead to another infection. In most cases, though, fluid in the ears resolves on it's own. You should follow up with your doctor in about one month to confirm this. If the fluid is still there, your doctor may want your grandson to be seen by an ENT.

Infections of the throat are often accompanied by fever, headache and stomach ache. The most common diagnosis is a viral illness. These typically resolve on their own after a few days.

And I heard cough syrup helps and thought it could also help her sleep.","Doctor":"Rather than cough syrups, antiallergic syrups are more helpful. Cough syrups are of two types, cough depressants and expectorants. NyQuil contains Dextromethorphan which depresses cough and I would not prefer giving it. You may give some expectorant instead. Steam helps in diluting the cough and acts as a good expectorant. Give steam inhalation as well as gurgling with lukewarm water. Antiallergics most often have some sedative action and may make your child sleep more."},{"Patient":"My 5 month old grandaughter is staying the weekend with me and started running a fever of 100.

She is little fussy but is still smiling and playing. she did take an unusual amount of naps yesterday and today but never slept more than 30 min. how do i know if she is teething or her throat is hurting?","Doctor":"Sore throat in a child occurs either due to certain viruses like epstein barr virus or due to certain bacteria like streptococcus. For breast fed babies, such problems generally do not occur. But for formula fed babies such things may occur. You need not assume the cause of fever to be sore throat however but some sort of viral infection is likely to be the cause. If the child is playful and otherwise ok, you need not get concerned but if you feel that the child is not feeding well or is lethargic, you will have to take the child to a doctor and get her blood counts and C-reactive protein checked. Give paracetamol to contol fever. Teething is not associated with fever. Throat hurting is also quite unlikely. Your doctor can examine and say more."},{"Patient":"Hi my one month old daughter has had nazel congestion for about a week and a half tried sailine drops dr prescribed nebulizer 4x a day even tried sitting in a steamy bathroom with her and nothing seems to work she s eating fine but just can t sleep Plz help should I go to er get her looked at again or is it ok","Doctor":"Nasal congestion is a common problem in children of this age. They are nose breathers and their nostrils are very small and have a tendency to get blocked. Apart from saline drops you may use nasivion which is a decongestant. Since she is feeding well, I can assume that her general health is fine and there is no cause of worry.

Pls advise what would be the best way forward on my daughter s health.","Doctor":"Lariago or such antimalarials should not be given without confirming the presence of malaria but since it is already being given, you need to complete the course as prescribed. Meftal P contains mefenamic acid and is effective in reducing fever. Viral fevers are very common and could be transmitted to your daughter. Give her meftal P or paracetamol syrup to reduce the fever. You may give sponging with water at room temperature.

Can if i use paracetemol250 alone is enough or do i need to use antibiotic also? Or else please give me prescription. Usually we use Fepanil125 till now for normal fever and SUMO for high fever. What do you suggest.","Doctor":"Most of such fevers are caused by viruses where antibiotics are ineffective. So, you do not need to give antibiotics. Paracetamol helps in reducing fever. If you use paracetamol 250mg/5m syrup, you will have to give half the amount in ml than if you had given 125mg/5ml syrup. How much you need is dependant on the actual weight of the child. Fepanil contains paracetamol but Sumo contains paracetamol 125 mg + Nimesulide and I would not recommend the use of the latter. You may use Meftal P instead. It contains mefenamic acid and is more effective in reducing temperature.We cannot give you prescriptions through this platform.

You may add chicken and eggs but in mashed form. You may give fruits in grated or mashed form - no need to boil them. Biscuits or other cereal based foods may be given in mashed or softened form. Gradually increase the frequency of such foods to 6-8 times a day. I would not comment on the amount. You can gradually increase it to 8-12 ounces per meal. These items are more nutritive than formula like cerelac and so I would not prefer cerelac or such preparations and hence am not commenting on their quantity. Continue breast milk upto 1 year of age.

Since I m a NICU nurse I was wondering if they might have intubated for any reason and didn t tell us, that might be causing this persistant cough. Any suggestions ? We have a cool mist vaporizer In Her room for the night and we don t let anyone smoke in the house. Other wise she is healthy and has been walking now for two weeks.","Doctor":"Most children of age between 6 months and 3 years of age suffer from a condition called bronchiolitis/croup/laryngo-tracheo-bronchitis which is caused by certain viruses and is generally unrelated to intubation. It may persist chronically in the age range mentioned and may manifest with chronic cough. Giving nebulistation is the best treatment and since you have the mist vaporiser, that will do the work. Add levolin inhaler through spacer device during the episodes and things should be fine."},{"Patient":"Hi My baby is 2.5 months old.I was Breast feeding him until now.

Since the adverse effects affect very small number of individuals, ofloxacin is widely used by doctors without any reports of growth retardation.

The dosage is proper and you need not worry. Do not worry about the warning labels as doctors might have a different thing in mind while prescribing and that correlation might not be apparent to you.

The fact that he didn't lose consciousness at the time of the injury, virtually rules out any serious head injury. The next sign to look for is vomiting within the first 24 hours.

Decision to start antibiotics is taken by proper examination and history of patient and can not be generalised.

You're approach has been excellent but at this point we have to consider that the throat pain, and accompanying symptoms, may be due to a bacterial infection.

This has been happening since I was a child and it is rare I have a dry night. In the past if seen my GP and been advised to wear pull ups during this happening for my mums sake so she doesn t have to wash sheets every night. This has affected me from being embarrassed to go out and sleepovers and since I ve been going to my doctor uv tried the following: bed wetting alarms, desmopressin tablets, pelvic exercises, not drinking hours before bed, emptying bladder completely before bed, waking up in the night and even to the point where I stay up all night until the morning so I know for sure when u need a wee instead if being in a deep sleep. After using medication alarms pull ups and training my bladder non of these worked and I ve searched about if it could be problems inside and kidneys were involved in this situation on some sites I found. When I was younger I was always doing wee samples and having water infections and cystitis.

I appreciate the fact that you are really concerned about your daughter. You can definitely help her by firstly giving her the mental strength to believe and accept that this is temporary and she need not fear. Secondly, you have taken to the doctor and she is on medication for the same which is the best thing you have done. Thirdly, I would want to emphasise on you checking on her diet. There is a possibility of food poisoning, infection in the stomach etc beacuse you have mentioned that the pain began only after she ate outside food. Symptoms of food poisoning include vomiting, nausea, stomach pain, and even slight fever. With regards to diet, you need to ensure she drinks a lot of fluids in the form of plain wated, juices, soups etc to make up for the lost fluids through vomiting. She should be well hydrated. She can consume bland foods that will not irritate her digestive system such as rice, milk, banana, soft breads etc. Give some nuts for protein intake. Ensure you do not give heavy foods because you need to give time for the stomach to get back to normal. Avoid spicy, sweet, sour, bitter foods. Try to keep the diet very simple and bland so that the virus/bacteria does not have suitable conditions to grow. Diet along with medication shall definitely help her tackle the situation.

You can continue the rest of the medications.Regards - Dr. Sumanth"},{"Patient":"Hello, my daughter, (an 8 year old twin), seemingly out of nowhere has developed a visible protrusion on her right temple. It s firm, fixed and non-painful. It would seem to be a preauricular cyst, but there is no pitting , and palpates deeply, rather than superficially. Beginning just slightly above/at the tragus and extending directly outward about an inch toward the cheekbone, it lays over the temple. This has only come to our attention in the last few days, and seems quite large to have not been noticed until now. No other symptoms or causations are present. Is this a likely site for a malignancy?? We have an appt. scheduled, but for now...worried sick. Thank you.","Doctor":"Hi..this seems like a dermoid cyst as it is occurring at the junctional area of 2 bones of the skull. Nothing need to be worried as it is only a recent phenomenon and the kid's daily activities are not getting disturbed because of it.Regards - Dr. Sumanth"},{"Patient":"I just realized my 9 year old son has clubbed thumbs. Can this cause him to struggle with writing? I m always trying to encourage him to improve his hand writing and it has stayed the same. Now I m wondering if this can be causing an issue for him and what I can do about it?","Doctor":"Hi...clubbing only at the thumbs might be there since birth. But clubbing anywhere needs evaluation especially if the all the nails are cyanosed or bluish. I do not think this is the reason for his bad hand writing. But if the clubbing or swelling has started only recently then definitely it needs evaluation.Regards - Dr. Sumanth"},{"Patient":"My 10 year old son just developed a rash over night just in the armpit area and the tops of the thighs. we haven t changed anything and he didn t eat anything new. its flat and hot to the touch. not really spots but big blotches. any ideas? I m just not sure if i should take him in, he says it only itches alittle","Doctor":"Hi...Thank you for consulting in Health Care magic.By what you quote it should be an urticarial or a simple skin allergy. You can use Hydroxyzine at 1-2mg/kg/dose every 6th to 8th hourly for 7-10 days. Most important thing to be remembered is that it has a propensity to recur (called as second crop) within 10-14 days. If this happens, you can start using the same medicine but I suggest you get the kid evaluated with your pediatrician.Hope my answer was helpful for you.  I am happy to help any time.

This is quite natural. If he is active and playing around you need not worry. This age rather than the quantity of the food I suggest you concentrate more on the number of times you feed him and also make whatever you feed him calorie dense by adding good amount of ghee to it.I suggest you not to use appetite stimulants on long run as they may cause drowsiness.Regards - Dr. Sumanth"},{"Patient":"I have a 6 year old that is on Ridalin, Intunive and Melatonin for ADD but he has NO appetite after he takes the meds...We feed him as often as we can BEFORE the meds, but he is still losing weight..Only weighs 34.6 lbs. now at 6 yrs. old....Do you think cyproheptadine or Megace? would be safe for him and help him with his appetite????","Doctor":"Hi...I understand your concern and agree that the weight of your kid is less than 5th percentile according to his age. But there is no use of appetite stimulants in kids. I take this opportunity to tell you certain scientific facts and relieve your distress - 1. An active is a well kid even if she/ he is not eating well. 2. Development of a kid is as important as or I would say even more important than growth alone.3. As the kids grow their interest in food decreases and interest in play activities increases so that they eat small quantity and run away to play. As parents we need to be more patient and feed than less quantity but more aliquots per day.4. This age rather than the quantity of the food I suggest you concentrate more on the number of times you feed her and also make whatever you feed her calorie dense by adding good amount of ghee to it.5.

Sometimes it will start with nausea and vomiting and then, continues into loose stools.Unless there is low urine output or very dull or excessively sleepy or blood in motion or green bilious vomiting...you need not worry. There is no need to use antibiotics unless there is blood in the motion. Antibiotics might worsen if unnecessarily used causing antibiotic associated diarrhoea.I suggest you use zinc supplements (Z&D drops 1ml once daily for 14 days) & ORS (Each small packet mixed in 200ml of potable water and keep giving sip by sip) as hydration is very important and crucial part of treatment. If there is vomiting you can use Tablet Ondansetron as prescribed by your pediatrician as this is a prescription drug.Regards - Dr. Sumanth."},{"Patient":"Hi I m 17, and this morning I got sever pain in my lower abdomen and between my stomach and legs, so I guess the pelvic area.

I could barley move and I had to clench onto the counter in the bathroom to stop from doubling over. It made me nauseous and light headed. I also experienced heat flashes. It only hurt when I moved and was full when I was still. I had experienced so upper abdomenal pain a few months before hand and it lasted for almost two weeks with all the same symptoms expect for being naseaous and having heat flashes. My mom says its just trapped gas, but I m not sure if it is. Can gas hurt that badly? I want your opinion. Is it just gas or is it something else?","Doctor":"Hi, Welcome to Healthcaremagic. I suspect it to be either appendicular problem or due to renal stones. The gas do not or rarely cause such severe pain.Do go for a Ultrasound scan which will surely identify and find out the exact cause of the pain.
