I have been evaluated by my local GP who said it is likely a varicocele, but after some research I think it is an epididymal cyst. This is only because a varicocele looks like it is a swelling of the whole vein itself, whereas in my case, it is a small hard, concentrated lump, within a tube . I am not one to go against my doctor as he is much more knowledgeable in the field than I am, but am just looking for a quick second opinion. Also, I have regularly checked my testicles following the discovery of the lump, and have found no problems and they feel normal. However I am feeling some discomfort around the abdomen and groin area which I read can be a symptom of TC. The discomfort isn t really painful or an ache, it is simply a feeling of discomfort. Could this be linked to the lump in the tube . Any help is appreciated as I do not think it is TC, but I can never be too careful. Thank you in advance.","Doctor":"HelloThanks for query.The hard pea sized lump in scrotum above the Testis is mostly a Spermatocele (Epididymal Cyst) as rightly suspected by you.However this needs to be confirmed by Ultrasound Scanning of Scrotum This is a benign cyst and does not need any treatment and you do not have TC .Discomfort that you have does not need any active intervention or treatment.Dr.Patil."},{"Patient":"Hi, i m 18 years old and i m suffering from itching around my genital areas and some small types of mums are there on my penis and it is very itching.

I have tried medicine, but that only lowered the amount of boils that show up at a time.

The infection is usually caused by a type of bacteria called Staphylococcus aureus (\\"staph\\"). Untreated boils can enlarge or grow together to form a giant multi-headed boil (carbuncle). Boils may resolve with simple self-care measures, but the infected fluid (pus) needs to drain in order for them to heal completely.

This will enable you to become father. Check it periodically for approx three months.After three months you will have to adopt different method of sterilisation. I advice you to go for artificial insemination. This will give you direct fertilisation. So ultimate effect is that you will become father.There are various methods for this e.g. in-vitro fertilisation, surrogate mother hood etc. I advice you to take the visit of the nearby doctors because they will guide us regarding the best suited method to you.

I noticed it would happen after I would use the restroom on some occasions. I also found wearing my belt too tight would cause me pain as well. I visited a specialist and he said my prostate was slightly swollen and had me try some antibiotics for 2 weeks. There was no noticable difference. He wanted to use a scope on my urethra but I wanted to wait to see if the condition would go away with time. I started noticing that the pain would go away for about 2 days after having sex. There was one week that we had sex 3 days in a row and the pain was gone for close to 5 days. I also noticed that being aroused for an extended amount of time would cause me pain.

God bless u, hoping prompt response , take care Shahzad","Doctor":"Hello, Often we see men are coming to us with abnormal semen analysis report showing very low (\\"Oligospermia\\") or absent (\\"Azoospermia\\") sperm count or very poor \\"motility\\" (ability to move) of the sperms. Naturally, they are very much worried and want to know whether medicines can be helpful. Two things must be remembered 1) Semen Report must be REPEATED from an AUTHENTIC LABORATORY after ABSTINENCE of 3-5 days. This is important, as the sperm count varies day to day. It takes almost 3 months to produce the sperms. therefore, if today you wear very tight underwear or you have high fever, your sperm count (checked after 3 months from today) will be low. As a result, a SINGLE ABNORMAL SEMEN ANALYSIS report does NOT HAVE ANY SIGNIFICANCE. You need to repeat it. 2) Both Male and Woman should be seen together. What treatment is required, actually depends on the reports of both the partners, their age and duration of infertility.  Moreover, the pregnancy will ultimately happen on the woman. That's why, we need to see both together. What medicines should I take if the second semen analysis report is also abnormal? It all depends on how abnormal the report is. In case of mild abnormalities, we give medicines called \\"Antioxidants\\" (special types of minerals and vitamins that act on the sperms) for 2-3 months and ask to repeat the test again to see if there is any imporvement. At the same time, some life-style changes are advised. These include avoidance of smoking and alcohol, reducing weight, avoidance of using tight underwear, prolonged sitting and driving. However, if the problem is severe, you can take antioxidants. But it is more IMPORTANT to do some tests to FIND OUT THE CAUSE. Sometimes, we can find the cause like diabetes, which if controlled, can improve your sperm count without any other treatment. What tests are required? You may need physical examination of your genital organs by the doctor. You may be advised some blood tests for hormones (Testosterone, FSH, LH, Sugar etc). Some ultrasound examination of your testicles or prostate gland may be advised. In severe cases, some genetic testing (blood test to see if there is any chromosomal problem) may be needed. Can any medicines help if there is severe problem? In most of the cases, medicines cannot help. You can take antioxidants but SHOULD NOT RELY solely on it. In most cases, you will require IUI or IVF. However, there is ONLY ONE CASE where medicines can ACT DRAMATICALLY. That is if there is problem in the pituitary gland (situated in the brain). In that case, taking gonadotrophin injections for 3-6 months will significantly improve your sperm count. What's the problem if medicines are taken for long time? As such, medicines will not harm. But if you take medicines despite the fact that your sperm count is not improving, you can land up in azoospermia. This is because, in male having severe oligospermia, there is a tendency that sperm count may further decrease over time. therefore, relying on medicine will INDIRECTLY HARM you. Rather, you should think of IUI or IVF. Can Testosterone be taken? Even if your testosterone is low, if you start taking tablet/ injection of testosterone from outside, your SPERM COUNT WILL DECLINE FURTHER. Therefore, under any circumstances, if you want to become father, you SHOULD NOT TAKE TESTOSTERONE. Sometimes, after hormonal tests, we can advise tablets like Letrozole, which can help to improve the testosterone level, indirectly. IUI or IVF- What to do? If the sperm count is mildly/ moderately low, IUI (Intrauterine Insemination) can be tried. however, if its severely low, you should go for special type of IVF (in vitro fertilization), called ICSI (Intracytoplasmic Sperm Injection). All of these will be done using your sperms only. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further.

It burns after like 10 sec after i urinate and cut is at tip from where we urinate. It also burn occasionally when i don t urinate. Also, during swimming i had itching in my balls and i had to stop swimming after this itching and burning in tip of meatus.

You do not want to do anything more in it.Only thing you have to maintain good hygiene over the cut.

Plz help me by answering all upper questions","Doctor":"Hello and Welcome to ‘Ask A Doctor’ service. I have reviewed your query and here is my advice.Masturbation is not a bad habit at all. People have very false belief regarding the masturbation.Sperm production can be continued throughout the life. So, even if you release it, it won't do any harm to you. People are practising it since many years.In fact, it has distinct advantage of satisfaction of desire, pleasure and mental relaxation. Once you complete your act, your mind becomes very clear and you can do any work with good concentration.There is also no chance of any STDs with this act. Only thing I would suggest that your hand must be clear while you are doing the act.Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further.Regards,Dr. Arun"},{"Patient":"hi Doctor, I am 41 male. I think my urine flow has reduced eventhough I drink more than 3 litres of water.

No burning or itching accompanied the discharge, and I have not seen it since, and perhaps urinated 2-3 times since.

I do not know how I got it because I never did any sexual intercorse with anyone & I used to think it to be a minor infection & that it will heal with time. And, also I started to ignore it. However, three months ago I consulted a doctor & he diagnosed it. But the situation was that I have had to get married. So I even did the VDRL, HIV tests which were negative, before marriage. Then I started to apply PODOWART on that particular area once a week. But I was told it will take months to heal. In the meantime, I informed my wife about it & we took pracautions like abstinence & while oral intercourse we used condom after washing my genital area. We used to kiss each other. This went for two months. But my question is, is there any chance that my wife has been transmitted HPV by myself? And, should I get her vaccinated with HPV vaccine immediately? Does it advance to carcinoma? Should I get her tested for HPV?","Doctor":"Hello,,Genital wart is caused by Human Papillomavirus (HPV), which affects only the skin and it will be localized to the wart.

The pain has become so intense recently, that he has stopped sex immediately. He tells me that he feels something csmall on the walls of my vagina that is hurting him and causing this burning sensation. I however, dont feel any pain and i am well lubricated naturally.. Please help! Thanks!!!","Doctor":"Hello,,It might be that you have done rough sex with your girl friend. There can be injury to the soft tissues of penis and urethra. This can cause small lacerations in the wall of urethra. When more force is exerted due to continued sex, this will cause burning and pain during passing urine as the soft tissues are engorged with blood and blood vessels are dilated and the lining or urethra might have suffered small amount of damage.Please avoid sex for 3 to 4 days and use lubrication while doing it gently. Apply enough lubrication jelly on your penis before penetration. Have a relaxed sex session with long foreplay and create a good emotional bond with your wife. This will also help in avoiding friction injury to your penis during intercourse.Thank you."},{"Patient":"Hii. I am age 35 male.

After a week the irritation has gone and the tear has healed but there was still some slight discomfort/itchiness once in a while at the tip of the penis and around the scrotum area. When to the doc again., Gave me another cream for the scrotum and penis head. 1 week later, itchiness around scrotum/head has gone but the slight discomfort is still apparent once in a while. On top of that, i keep having the urge to pee, especially at night. When i check my skin around the foreskin area, it seems to be normal again, doesnt seem to have any discharge but i cant be sure,. Should i be worried? Any advice? Thanks","Doctor":"Yes you could have a sexually transmitted disease. It could be viral or bacterial. Unless you test for it, it is quite difficult to say. Creams wont be of help. You will need to take antibiotics if it is bacterial. It could also be a urinary tract infection which will still need antibiotics to clear."},{"Patient":"Hi, i am twenty three year old guy. i masturbate 2 - 3 times a day since its considered the moste safest practice of sex , but its not affecting my social life in any manner.

I need your help. 2 years back when I intended to stop masturbating, I didn t even have wet dreams for 20 -25 days. But now I am in big trouble. I am so weak as I started masturbating at the age of 10, of course that s when our muscles and bones are growing but that was an unfortunate happening. Now I am 19, that makes 17 and before that I was alright. But after 17 something really bad happened and I started having wet dreams every day. That made me really weak, my mind was flustered.

Had sex with a girl late last year (Dec 22), she used prostinor 2 and complained about stomach upsets and she saw some blood discharges, later she was ok. We had sex again on 6th,7th and 8th of January this year being protected once in those 3 days. She took the prostinor again, saw little discharges and later she had her period. We had it again on the 17th and 18th of February. I was protected the first day and the first part of the second day. I was unprotected the second time we had it the second day (18th) but i m pretty sure I did not ejaculate into her. She took the prostinor a week later after she said she forgot to use it.

But what I want to know first of all, is it ok to do it, and with you being a doctor, would you encourage it? I ve seen many different yes and no answers online and I just want one sure answer from a doctor. Are there health benefits? Should I feel good about masturbation? Because I don t think I really want to stop doing it... Also, how much masturbation is enough or too much? Lately, I ve been doing it about once a day, but before Sunday of this week I didn t do it for about five days. So it s not excessive. I don t masturbate more than once a day (for probably no more than 7 days straight). And like I said before, sometimes more than others, I skip days, be it a day or more. Is this an ok amount?

Quite a considerable lump has formed on his frenulum where the cut was. It's not hard and it quite pliable. I suggested that perhaps the cut was a lot deeper than we thought and theres now a pocket of blood, but it doesn't look purple. Maybe its abnormal scar tissue that needs fixing? However, after feeling it had healed we had sex last night and it is now inflamed. So I'm thinking sex was a mistake so soon. He didn't pull the foreskin back for a week or so after the cut so could that have affected the healing process. Some help would be awesome as I think he's starting to panic a little. Have looked in my anatomy books and there doesn't seem to be anything on torn frenulums. Anyway, thank you =)","Doctor":"Hi, It can be due to scar, if pain remains severely, you must do surgery.

As a young man, I used to masturbate a lot and it was after one such session that I started feeling disorders in my scrotum till it developed to these movements. When the movements are on I actually see the scrotum sack move as well and if I put my finger under the scrotum I  actually feel the movements like one is hold some worms in his hand which  are sort of “struggling to escape”, that kind of feeling. Over the years I have been consulting General Practitioners who would tell me that my condition was normal and there was really nothing to worry about. However, some would prescribe me amitriptyline for a couple of months, but this never really helped my situation. Now, over the years I have developed a very bad  odour coming from my genitals which I suspect could be linked to this problem (also have the same under my armpits though) . I have often thought perhaps the scrotum skin is so worn out  (though it does not look so) that it now stinks. Now, I worry more about the  odour than the movements as they are not painful as such. The odour makes it quite difficult for me to freely mix with people and this is worse in my professional circles. Just last year I went to consult a urological surgeon who advised me that I had varicoselectomy that is why I feel the wormlike movements. He said to correct that I needed to undergo a minor operation which I did, but to no avail. I have also consulted a dermatologist about the odour, but so far the prescriptions I got from him have not really helped my situation either. I need your assistance please! Age:41","Doctor":"Hi, This type of pain and location is suggestive of epididymitis which is inflammation of part of the testicle and this not uncommon in males especially in young age. This is usually treated with 10 days of antibiotics, usually ciprofloxacin and there are no permanent consequances. Masturbation and intercourse should be avoided till pain persist, if possible since I may prolong inflammation course. Some more serious conditions such as tumors or torsion are rare but in doubtful cases, you should do Doppler ultrasound or scintigraphy. In this particular case, I don’t think this is required and this should improve on antibiotic therapy. Hope I have answered your query. Let me know if I can assist you further.

I am in my mid 40 s and I just started to take minocycline for adult acne about 3 weeks ago. So let me first apologize for the graphic explanation that I’m about to share. When my partner and I start having sex, my vagina is sopping wet, like too wet sometimes… Then in the middle of intercourse I have been getting super dry until I orgasm, then I get wet again. This has happened the last three times we have had sex. I am concerned because I have never had a dry vagina, and it actually kind of hurts during intercourse and the day after. The only thing that has changed is that I started to take minocycline. So my question is… is the minocycline drying me out?","Doctor":"Hello dear,Thank you for your contact to health care magic.I read and understand your concern.

I work in a auto shop in very heavy pants so I have been getting normal sweat pimples occasionally but I feel the proximity and area of these are a little different.

I know nothing is certain over the internet but a little peace of mind will make me feel better","Doctor":"Hi thereThe symptoms that you have described is most likely to be a fungal infection which occurs after skin excoriation caused by sweat. Fungal infections can be treated relatively easily but some modification in clothing will allow it to heal faster. Try wearing looser clothing or clothing that will not make you sweat as much. When sleeping , if possible , wear as little clothes that cover your pubic area as possible. Antifungal creams/ointments such as Ketozole / Clotrimazole /Lamisil etc. should be applied on the area. Remember , scratching will only allow the infection to spread faster and delay healing. A mild antihistamine will help if the itching is affecting your daily activities."},{"Patient":"hello,yesterday spots appeared on my foreskin and now today they have turned into cold sore type blisters.this is not the first time and when i spoke to my doctor he said it was herpes and just to put cream on them.but they are appearing frequently (maybe once every two months),especially after sex but not always.","Doctor":"Thanks for asking in healthcaremagic forum  I appreciate your concern.

Thanks Regards, Faraz.","Doctor":"Hi, Faraz. The best way for you would be exercise and balanced diet to decrease your weight. Then only will there be a chance to decrease the Gynecomastia. However, the definitive treatment for it would be Surgery or Liposuction. It is most definitely fat that is collected under the chest skin. You can get this confirmed by getting examined by a Surgeon and a FNAC test. In this test, we put a needle into the lump and take out some cells to see what is growing inside. Even if you get it operated there is always the chance that the fat will get collected again. So the best treatment would be to decrease your body fat naturally with exercise and diet restriction.

They usually dont cause any problems and dont require removal. but the only treatment is removal. We remove these cysts only for cosmetic reasons or in some cases if they get infected due to handling or poking by the patient.

I am a 21 years old male with a girlfriend that once has cold sore on her lips but it has recovered.

About 3 days later I realize that I feel a burning pain when I urine and there s a couple of pimple-like lumps showing on the shaft of my penis. I went to consult a normal clinic doctor about this and he told me that it could be genital warts. He gave me anti biotics for my burning pain during urine and a cream that contains steroid for the warts 3 days later I am not feeling any better so I decided to see a dermatologist. So she told me that it s herpes and gave me valtrex pills and Bactroban oilment and a anti-imflammation pill as the burning pain during my urine is not better As I took the medications, the herpes is healing up but the pain when I urinate is not any better . So I went to see a urologist and he gave me doxycycline and he say that the antibiotics I am having is not complete to fight the bacteria in my urinal tract. So now week 4 and I have completed a total of 3 types of antibiotics (1 of it is doxycycline while the other 2 I forget it s name) completed valtrex pills and got ASAP silver cream to apply my herpes. The herpes is gone and the buring pain has more or less gone away. But my semen is yellow-ish!!!! I went back to the clinic and the doctor say that it maybe a prostate infection.

I had no visible swelling or discharge, just severe pain in the testicles, which began in the groin. I was put on two weeks of 2x per day doxycycline, and it appeared to disappear. Soon, the discomfort in the groin came back and I made an appointment before the testicular pain redeveloped. I was put on another week of 2x per day doxycycline, and this dose felt less effective. I went to a urologist and he currently has me on 3 weeks of 2x per day ciprofloxacin. I m in week 2 of that treatment and it just seems like the antibiotics tame the infection, but do not eliminate it entirely. I had a scrotal ultrasound, which showed nothing else wrong. So, my main question is should I refrain from ejaculating while I m on this medication?...My doctors never specified, and I feel like this may be influencing the recovery. I read online that others have been told by their physicians to ejaculate regularly because it will clear out the infection, but read the opposite elsewhere. So, what can should I do to make this go away for good?","Doctor":"Hi, you should ejaculate regularly. And you should also get a Urine culture and a Semen culture done to see if there is any offending organism causing the infection. The test will also specify what antibiotics to take to clear the infection.Genitourinary infections are very stubborn and quite difficult to eradicate. But dont worry. With the tests guiding your Doctor it should be possible to get rid of it.Take care and feel free to ask any more queries on the issue.You can also leave a Specialist query if you need to contact me directly.Dr Rishi, New Delhi, India."},{"Patient":"Please write your query here Dear Doctor...m a gay guy of 24 years old so iv bin havin a problem wth my anas 4 3 months nw.m nt having sex anymore n Im craving now.im from da doctor last month he said its paals n gave a salf to applay.so I mustubate every night.","Doctor":"Hi, the pain is likely due to the sexual activity.You should avoid anal sex as rightly told by your Doctor.

It was all fine but now yesterday and today my testicals are dry, red, and very wrinkly (they also have a strange odor). I wonder If it was some of the shampoo that didn tt get washed off or what. I know it is not an std because I m a virgin.","Doctor":"Thanks for asking in healthcaremagic forumIn short: Scrotal skin is very delicate, your shampoo might have caused allergy.Explanation: Usually scrotal skin has abundant sebaceous glands which secrete sebum and keeps skin moist and in a good condition. So, if you use soap/shampoo excessively it may wash all the sebum and cause dryness. So, for now you can apply coconut/Vaseline locally to keep it moist and by time it will be ok.                 If not subsided after 2 days visit a doctor."},{"Patient":"Hello, I have been having problems with my left testicle.
