The sprain of these muscles can also give rise to pain.I would rather advice you to have a x-ray or ultrasonography done of your abdomen, to rule out two things which you are missing i.e. renal stones and some lesion in intestine.(and it can also rule out appendicitis,if at alll its present.)hope my info helped youregards,Dr Hari Om ChandrakarMBBS"},{"Patient":"Hi,I am a 40 yr old African American woman with no known history of breast cancer on either side of my family.

Didn't really feel any significant amount of pain either, but there was this constant..discomfort. I began to squeeze my  nipple on the right breast, and to my surprise, a little black bead of liquid oozed out!

Blood tests are non contributory to confirm or deny any relapse. Only imaging like CTscan or PET scan can really detect recurrence   (Ultrasound to a certain extent as well and not to forget clinician's vaginal exam which is paramount).

It was stage 1a grade 2. I was referred for chemotherapy but the consultant advised against because I have had lung surgery and have bronchiectasis on both lungs. It was felt that I was at risk of contacting severe pneumonia. I was therefore referred to discuss radiotherapy . However another of my existing health problems is FAP. I have had a colectomy with IRA to prevent colorectal cancer . I am advised that the side effects to brachytherapy can cause bladder/bowel problems. I do not want brachytherapy if it is to leave me incontinent. What are the chances of this, pleasre. I am also told I must lie still for fourteen hours. A catheter will be inserted so that I don t need to urinate but with no colon I need to empty my bowels aroud five times aday. What can be done about this? Also what happens if I cough?

If I decide not to have brachytherapy and the cancer returns can it be successfully treated? Many thanks. Marlene (UK)","Doctor":"Hi there, if your histology is adenocarcinoma stage IA Grade 2 then observation is recommended option, in case there is some other poor risk factor and you are offered brachytherapy then brachytherapy can be given by LDR (low dose rate) which you are mentioning is long time etc and other is HDR (High dose rate ) which is given usually 2 to 3 sessions and is over in minutes and is very comfortable. Ask your radiation oncologist to offer you HDR brachy or refer you to centre with such technology. With HDR brachy I don't foresee any significant trouble for you though theoretically it can cause side effects of diarrhoea and urinary frequency but its very well tolerated and no problems occur practically either during RT or after RT.Regards"},{"Patient":"I ve had chest X-rays witch are clear as I ve had breathing problems for 7 months, I m only 31, cancer is in my family, I ve now got white ruff bits on the inside of my cheek and a small lump just behind my ear and I ve had a cold for a few days witch has gone, my glands are not up I ve had a cough for 6 months and with the astzmer like breathing problems I m getting fed up what could it b, I ve taken photos of my mouth if u need to c them thanks Kate","Doctor":"Dear Kate,It sounds like infection, but you need a proper checkup in terms of evaluation of white spots as some white spots can be hiding malignancy but commonly they are infection.

For decades I have had low abdominal burning in the same place and often think it is a bladder infection but it never is. It often feels like it is moving/twitching and it burns.   I had a bad bout of it recently witn no appetite and lots of anxiety and ended up in the hosptial with constipation.  My md is setting up a colonoscopy and gave me some ativan and celexia. He says the pain and constipation are signs of colon cancer but I have had this recurring burning in the same place for as long as I can remember. He also said I was about as anxious and dry mouthed as a person can be and gave me a shot of valium.   I had been on zoloft for years but was really feeling great, no bowel issues and had gone off zoloft about 10 days before this incident happened and I thought I had sufficiently weaned over several months.  I am still constipated but the anxiety is less and I have a little appetite.  At the hospital they did a digital x-ray and said I was hideously constipated and sent me home with a go-easy and 3 ativan.  That worked well but the symptoms returned, especially the anxiety/butterflies so I started up the zoloft at 50m day but it didn't seem to help and Dr. Wade switched me to celexia yeterday along with an antibiotic for a sinus infection.  All bloodwork is normal.My question is does colon cancer grow in the same place ibs/diverticular is and cause worse distress?  I did get a diagnosis of diverticular years ago but I don't know where it is.  The burning pain is in the same place it always has been for as long as I can remember and the condition has always been non-smell gas and slow moving bowls/constipation but this has been a long spell of it, about a month now from when I stopped taking zoloft, the trip to the ER with anxiety and constipation about 10 days after stopping the zoloft and now 3 weeks back to zoloft but still not eating, moving bowels much and mountains of anxiety.  Then seeing Dr. Wade yesterday.","Doctor":"Hi there,I completely agree with your doctor who booked you for colonoscopy as vague symptoms like you are describing, better to rule out any cancerous growth inside. Overall I understand you have IBS/ diverticular disease and your concern is that whether cancer can exaggerate the symptoms if it occurs at the same place. This I don't think anyone has concrete evidence about and one can't reply with any certainty. I would not worry too much if colonoscopy comes as normal.Take care, Regards"},{"Patient":"I am a 38 year old female.  I have a few female issues and am not sure if it's all related.

I have mysteriously now have very low iron and I'm wondering if this medication could cause that problem. I've had a colonoscopy and a panendoscopy and everything is ok.  Also are their certain foods I should avoid whilst on this medication. Thanks, Carol","Doctor":"Hi and thanks for the query,It would be very unlikely that the low iron be related to Clopidogrel. It has not been associated with bone marrow depression. the only mechanism this would have been possible would have been through gatsrointestinal bleeding. However, the doses you take are relatively small, and one would have expected you to report a history of epigastric pain  or a positive stool blood test (occult blood).Othercauses of low iron should be further investigated, a complete blood count for a proper investigation and characterisation of the anemia should be done, serum ferritin levels are also useful. A thin blood film to know the nature of the red blood  is important. Rare causes of low iron due to prolonged chronic bleeding like parasitic infections (hook worms)  should not be forgotten.I strongly suggest you book an appointment with a hematologist.Best regards,Bain LE, MD."},{"Patient":"I am on synthroid.  75mg.

What do you think?","Doctor":"Hi and thanks for this query.I am sorry about what you are experiencing.TSH normal values vary slightly from one lab to the other. If your doctor said it was normal, then i believe him.The symptoms you have cited make the diagnosis of under treated hypothyroidism very likely. It is a good thing that you are going in for blood work up and a physical.Thyroid hormones supplementation dosages vary fro one patient to another. Even the same patient may need the doses t be reviewed several times in the course of his/her treatment. A simple adjustment will correct the identified problem.Hysterectomy per se cannot be directly responsible.

Due to this conditions you may also suffer from frequent urinating, burning while urinating, blood in the urine, fever. If the pain starts suddenly, stones are more probable. Gradually starting pain is rather caused by an infection.Ovarian issues like cyst or inflammation can be also the reason. Spine disc herniation can give such symptoms as well.I suggest you to visit your doctor and have urine analysis, blood work and abdominal ultrasound. Gynecologist consult and trans vaginal ultrasound should be done as well.In case of urinary tract issues, you should drink plenty of mineral water (like 3 liters/24 hours) and start cranberries supplementation.

He was administered Firmagon androgen deprivation injections and underwent internal (seed implants) and external radiation treatments.  He had the anticipated side effects during that time, but now, 2 years later, is having extreme fatigue and chronic testicular pain.  He has mentioned his symptoms to his general practitioner, oncologist and urologist, without any response as to cause or possible treatment.  I don't know what his current PSA is, and am not aware of his continuing to take any androgen deprivation medications.  Are these current symptoms side effects from the injections and/or radiation, and is there anything that can be done to help alleviate them?","Doctor":"Hello and welcome to HCM,Presence of fatigue and testicular pain, with a past history of prostatic cancer has to be investigated.A serum PSA level needs to be done.PSA levels increase exponentially in case of recurrence or matastasis of prostatic cancer.Appearance of fatigue can be due to distant metastasis.Chronic testicular pain warrants examination of the testis.A ultrasonography of the testicular region is also required to look for any enlargement of the testis.These symptoms are unlikely to be due to radiation exposure or hormonal treatment.Consult your treating doctor for clinical examination, relevant investigations and management of the problem.Thanks and take careDr Shailja P Wahal"},{"Patient":"Hi, I am 58 years old male. Recently i removed tumor from small intestine with a size of 6x5x4 cm. My IHC report was, CD117 positive and CD34 with focal positive, while SMA is negative and ki-67 is positive with 1%. Based on these data our physician diagnos as it was GIST and start imatinib. My query is that is it sufficient data to diagnos for GIST and as per the data how long I have to take imatinib.","Doctor":"Hi and welcome to HCM. Thank you for your query.It is never 100%,but it is enough for right diagnosis. Also GIST can be easily recognized by morphological characteristic which can be seen during the surgery and by clear borders and non-infiltration of surrounding tissue. If imatinib is used just for prevention of recidive then it should be used only short time. If there is still evidence of tumor then it has to be taken for 6m-1 year. Wish you good health.

I wasn't told about any stages in this but that i would have to go back in again to remove the lymph nodes. Does this mean i'm at stage 3? and was told if this spead anywhere else is this possible and where can it spead? i think i was just shell shocked when i heard. The other thing that was said was that he would have to talk to a radiatolist to see if he would go with on radiation therapy or more to be cut away. does this mean he is not sure if all was removed?","Doctor":"Hi and welcome to HCM. Thank you for your query.If there are confirmed positive lymph nodes then it is stage 3. But positive lymph nodes must be verifed by biopsy. Vulvar carcinoma can be spread by local inflitrating or by metastasing. Local infiltration can involve urethra,bladder rectum and other surrounding tissue. Sometimes it cant be determined whether lymph nodes are positive or not and then radiotherapy is done to prevent possible spreading.

Vomiting could be due to a concussion or any level of intra cranial hemorrhage. in that case you have to see her level of consciousness as well which also fades away in case of a significant head injury.I am not aware as to the stage of breast cancer she had.

Urine cultures and antibiotic sensitivity tests to prescribe the appropriate anti biotic to tackle the particular germ in question could be very useful. This not only aids in diagnosis, but in measuring the efficacy of the treatment when completed.

You should have mentioned the exact subtype. After thyroid surgery there are possibility of radioiodine ablation . You should have mentioned the detailed treatment history.

There are sometimes syndromic association but those conditions are rare and your symptoms not fit to specific one. Colonic polyp if multiple should be followed up at regular interval .

Is there a correlation or a causation between the sores and the chemo chemicals? Could he be having a reaction to the vaginal secretions that may contain the chemo chemicals?","Doctor":"Hi, This is a new problem you have mentioned.

He has had it for about one month now. It seems pretty close under the skin; so we've been hoping that it is some kind of skin blemish or inflamation (maybe a boil, etc). However, it doesn't seem to be progressing in any way. It is about half an inch long and the shape is oblong. It is quite hard, but it does have some spongy feeling. He can feel it constantly even when he's sitting still and especially when he moves, and it's causing a burning pain and headaches. It is especially painful when he tries to sleep, or more specifically when he tries to lay down on it. He has a family history of cancer (brain tumor in particular) in both his mother and father. Because of this family history, we intend to be very careful with potential signs of anything that could be cancer-related; but he's only 35 years old. Is a fatty tissue deposit usually marked by this burning pain, or is this symptom more likely related to something malignant? Also, can the shape tell us anything (is there a different shape, such as jagged edges vs round like moles)? What kind of tests would you suggest (to find out what it is, how large it really is, and if it needs to be removed)?","Doctor":"Hi, Why do you think of cancer?  The only complaint is  swelling back of skull. Base of skull is different entity. Partly hard partly soft swelling may be due to some infection also. So a clinical examination is necessary.

Difficulty in swallowing commonly occur due to pathology in esophagus. Breast cancer can spread to the axilla , infraclavicular region, supraclavicular region and at distant site.

YYYY@YYYY","Doctor":"Hello and welcome to HCM,You have mentioned that the prostatic cancer has spread to the bone marrow.When the cancer cells start replacing the normal bone marrow, the normal blood cells and platelets are suppressed.Decrease in red blood cells causes anemia, decrease in white blood cells predisposes to infection and decrease in platelets cause spontaneous bleeding from various sites.Bleeding can be controlled by infusion of platelets.platelet transfusion can increase in number of platelets and thus control bleeding.You can consult your doctor for further management.Thanks and take careDr Shailja P Wahal"},{"Patient":"I am waiting for results of a biopsy .

They removed 90% of my pancreas, my spleen and my gallbladder. Last week I started having abdominal pain, after lab work my Dr. Sent me for Ct scan. They found a small fluid hematoma post surgery. Primary Dr told me to follow up with my Pancreatic Dr. When I called he stated it was almost impossible to have that two years post surgery. My question is how do I get rid of this fluid hematoma?","Doctor":"Hi, This is a difficult situation. Exact cause of fluid accumulation is difficult to say. Post surgery trauma may be a cause but after two year the chance is minimal . As you have mentioned it is hematoma then the collection is blood. This can be drained but the cause to be found out . Post op adjuvant treatment of pancreatic cancer should also be mentioned. You should better consult a surgical gastroenterologist."},{"Patient":"Hi i am Heidi a 37 yr old female i have found 2 small lumps on the left side of my neck.

I have a family history of Lymphoma my Auntie died from this several years ago.","Doctor":"Hi, The duration of the lump should be mentioned. Initially nothing to worry about. This may be due to infection though infective lymph nodes are generally painful.

Oh and I had 17 lymph nodes taken out and 5 had cancer on the same side.","Doctor":"Hi, Radiation has been given at the chest wall and supraclavicular area.

I know of a 65 year old cancer patient with metastatic cancer of the uterus who told me she definitely wanted to live but was going to use hospice to be more comfortable in her quest for a mind-body immunotheraputic healing. Prior to the hospice she had started to use the mind-body approach to revitalize the immune system to heal the cancer. Now after starting the hospice she seems to have lost interest in following through with this approach. Could it be the \\"lalaland\\" effect of the morphine taking away her will to live? What are your thoughts along these lines.","Doctor":"Hi, Morphine is needed very often in treating the cancer pain and there are definite indication and definite way to prescribe this drug. Depression is a common problem in cancer patients. There are many causes but morphine probably has no role in depression. Proper counselling is necessary at this stage, specialist onco-psychiatrist opinion to be taken."},{"Patient":"For the past year I have noticed that my friend is acting quite strangely.

Whenever he's around she drops everything for him and has ditched us on many occasions to stay in with him. What really scares me though is as i was reading through her facebook messages to her boyfriend (she left her page open on my computer) i noticed she was telling how she was vomitting blood and feeling awful due to the cancer. She's never mentioned anything to me about cancer. She also kept sayinghow nobody loves her and nobody wants to look after her. I cant see how she could have cancer as she plays sport regularly and has already booked her college accommodation for after the summer, meaning she must know she'll be better by then. Do you think this is really cancer she has or more of a psycheatric disorder?","Doctor":"Hi, Blood vomiting to be carefully evaluated. Loss of weight seems to be suspicious. It is to be confirmed whether altered blood or fresh blood is coming out. Upper G-I endoscopy is necessary. You should consult an internal medicine specialist.

Kind regards Charlene","Doctor":"Hello CharleneThis answer is from a Homoeopath. We do have a different approach to cancers. We should get the individuality of the patient, his genetic traits both in the mental and physical make ups. I do not know whether you understood or not. Please stop all the chemical drugs and allow him to express. What exactly was the life situation just before he had a stroke? How he reacted to that situation in mental level? Is he frightened due to the attack of stroke? Is he having fear of death? His present mental and physical symptoms can be very well picked up by an expert Homoeopath and give him relief. Please do not lose hope. Homoeopathic medicines will improve his general conditions like appetite and thus improved physical conditions will give him more hope and confidence to return to normal.

Simply based on this symptom no definite diagnosis can be made. Earache can be explained as the nerve supply to the throat region and tongue are similar like that of inner ear and there are communication.

I have a bad cough so my onc put me on anitbiotics. I'm about half done (5 of 10 days) but the mucus is unbelievable! I have always swallowed it but now my stomach is upset. Is the only thing to stop the mucus production time? Is there anything else I can do while waiting?","Doctor":"Hello friend,I hope you have breast cancer and along with that or secondarily developed lung cancer also. From the history it appears that the collapse of the lung and the diminished activities in the organ produces extra amount of mucus which is constantly brought out by cough. Antibiotics will not be useful because it is not the bacteria that make the problem, it is the general deterioration you have that make you prone to infection if at all it is there. So what is required is to improve your vitality. I am a homoeopath and so my advise is to take Homoeopathic treatment where YOU and not your diseased organs become important for the selection of the remedy. Antibiots may kill the bacteria for some time and is sure to recur because in addition to the lowered vitality, the strong chemo drugs will again weaken the constitution. Therefore approach an expert Homoeopath who can give you relief from the sufferings, not only from the cough which is less important when considering the disease cancer at present active in you.

I'm a healthy 49 yr old do not smoke or drink I exercise and eat healthy","Doctor":"Hello friend,There is a general trend in the society to suspect any tumour as cancer. you are no exception. That is why you also do the investigations to rule out cancer. The very sight of the lump started frightening you. Now you are in a panicky stage till you get a negative report after the CT scan. Cancer is associated with in curability and death and that is why you are scared.If you can remember the date on which you started noticing the lump in the SCM muscle, then take it from me, there should have had a shocking and unexpected conflict in your life just before that. That must have been in your mind level . In certain part of the brain which corresponds to the particular organ and side of the neck, there was certain changes which ultimately produced the tumour. This tumour is not to kill you but to save you. If the lump is continuing to remain there as a sore that means,the conflict is not yet resolved. I am a Homoeopath and this I am giving from my experience. Homoeopathy can identify how you reacted to the above mentioned conflict and can select a corrective constitutional remedy to assist you to get back to original condition. Please do not get frightened even if the investigations tell you that you have cancer because Homoeopathy can cure cancer . Your fear can reduce the chance of  recovery but once you are aware of the condition and reveal everything to an expert Homoeopath, he can help you.

She lost 20lbs  about 5 months ago after a bout w/what she thought was a terrible flu. She then 3 wks ago found a enlarged lymph node on the left side. Large enough that if it wasnt in the lymph node it would be a mass. She is still fatigued and isnt able to lift her arms above her head. she can only put them straight out in front of her due to the pain it causes. Her PCP ordered labs and a chest X-ray. And referred her to a doctor(she did not know if it was an oncologist. Upon his return from vacation 2wks later a biopsy was done with a pathologist present. They drew 3 samples and then left the room. Upon their return, the pathologist asked if she smokes, she responded no, he then asked ever ? In which her response was no again. He then drew 2more samples. It's been 8 days (we were told it would be 3-5 days for results) and 3 days ago she got another bout of the flu- even to the point ofdry heaving, she still experienced naseau, and her stools is black. I asked her if it looks like coffee grounds and she said no just black as tar. She is also very weak. My mother in law had lung cancer and a very large mass from shoulder to bottom of ribs(diagonal across the chest along with cancer in the lymph nodes) and has since passed after fighting the good fight. Even my grandmother knows that she is bleeding somewhere if her stoole is black. She is very weak at this point and her symptoms are beginning to worry me as my fear is that this is what I think it may be. She of course had the sore throat along with her flu(s) I understand I do not have results to give you in this narrative, but that is because they haven't given us any.

I had hernia surgery 2yrs ago, where the surgeon used mesh to repair the hernia. My pain is on the same side as my first hernia. The surgeon checked me today and felt there was no hernia, and ordered a ct scan in avfew days. He seemed concerned though with my pain and it's location. The pain is directly over my first surgery site, it's deep and aching and travels down in my right testicle. I feel very nevous about what it could be, if it's not hernia. Are there any concerns of a mass or tumor or cancer? Is that why he ordered a ct scan? Also I've had 2 spinal fusions L4-S1 and a spinal stimulator implant in the last 3yrs. Any chance this issue could be related to my back issue? I'm 33yrs old... My apologies for all questions, but I'm concerned this is something more serious than what I thought...","Doctor":"Hello,                                                                                                                         Applying olive oil to the affected area of the leg. Olive oil is one of the best natural moisturizers which will instantly make the skin smoother and hydrated and all the itchy skin rashes will disappear.The small itchy and bumpy red spots that cause skin rash on legs can also be treated by using another natural source for skin diseases i.e. Aloe vera. The gel from aloe vera is very beneficial for restoring the skin to its normalcy and natural shine along with curing the rashes. It is also helpful as it kills the bacteria in the skin rash that might aggravate the problem further. Aloe Vera gel also hydrates the dry skin rash. Any mild moisturizer with vitamin E included can also be applied to legs. Vitamin E has anti-inflammatory properties; helps in softening and smoothening the skin.In case of flakes due to skin rash on legs, a great natural and home remedy is an exfoliating paste made from oats and aloe vera gel. It can be made by mixing half cup of oats with a small amount of aloe vera gel (approx. 20 ml). A moisturizer or body lotion can also be mixed but it has to be very mild. Once this paste is ready, it should be applied to the affected part of the leg.Regards."},{"Patient":"Hi, I am a nineteen year old female, and about three days ago I noticed I have a dime sized lump on my right mastoid bone. It is not movable and only causes me pain when I touch it. It is not red or irritated. It is not a bug bite, surely not a blemish, and is very hard, almost bone hard. I have had many ear infections as a kid and know positively that this is not a simple ear infection. I looked up a lot on mastoiditis and cysts. I am no medical professional but I can rule out both just based on the symptoms listed. I have been feeling very fatigued and my lower back/ kidney area has been hurting severely for multiple days. If it is any help, two of my grandmothers on my mothers side had cancer. One had ovarian and the other had breast cancer. I am running out of idea on what it could be and am getting quite frustrated. Going to see a doctor is the next step, but for now I am just looking for possible answers.","Doctor":"Sounds like an enlarged lymphnode. Painful enlarged lymph nodes are usually infectious in nature. It can be caused by a ear infection like you have guessed and 'ruled out'  or it could be something as simple as acne/pimples in your scalp that has caused it. Based on your description, it is not suspicious for cancer. As for the lower back pain, it could be a lumbar strain. Is it associated with your period? Do you know what activities exacerbate it and what relieves it? Do you have pain when you move/ bend or when you urinate?"},{"Patient":"i have had a lumpectomy of the breast as I had been diagnosed with a fibroid and this grew considerably.

I have to wait until next Weds for the results of the operation is there any information or assurances you can give me.","Doctor":"Hi and thanks for the query,I ma afraid you might a proper reevaluation. It is vital to redo and reconfirm the histologic aspect of the breast lump. This is so because, in case its a cancer, it could be signs of spread to other structures. It is very vital to make this possibility excluded.Secondly, the joint pain needs to be properly evaluated. Presence of absence of general symptoms like fever, swelling, general malaise need to be considered. Blood tests to exclude any rheumatologic disease are needed and x rays of affected joints if need. Confusion and forgetfulness might deserve a neurologists opinion. The psychological component in your case is an important consideration that could explain the forgetfulness and confusion aspects of the clinical scenario.I suggest you consult the surgeon who got the mass removed for a proper evaluation and planning of further management depending on the findings.thanks and best regards,Luchuo, MD."},{"Patient":"i have abnormally high pro lactin levels i have to have repeat bloods done every month to monitor i have no cyst on my pertuitry gland as have recently had an mri but i have had pain in my left boob for the last two months the doctor examind my brests this afternoon and found a small lump i am being referd to the hospital for an ultrasound on my breast but could ypu tell me is a high pro lactin level an indicator of breast cancer? there is no direct family history of breast cancer but my brother died aged 24 of germ cell cancer and all relatives that have passed on both sides of my family have died as a result of or from side effects of cancer?","Doctor":"Hi, High prolactin level has no relation with breast cancer.

An expert Homoeopath can very well remove the disease tendency in you and also keep you in perfect health preventing not only cancer, but any serious disease in future. Our case taking would suffice and there are advanced investigations which are not needed for a Homoeopath to prevent such disease tendencies. Best wishes to you.

Doctors gave her antibotics and the pain went away. 2 weeks later there started a discharge of puss from the lump and it became a painless lump. She also noticed the size of her breast had decreased in size. She has now been refered for a biopsy. Initially it was thought to be an abscess, but now since the pain has gone away and the lump is still there I've become very concerned. Is this breast cancer?","Doctor":"Hello friend,Your girl friend's problem is related to some mental conflict she suffered just prior to the date of noticing the lump on the breast. This mental conflict brings about some changes in the organs  through the mediation of the brain. Since the affection is on the breast, this can be related to partner , sex, family, etc. The swelling is not cancer. But the fear in her mind makes the problem. Once you go to doctors and  surgeons, for FNAC, Mammography and such investigations, her fear is going to worsen . The problem is created by the fear the society has attached to the icon of cancer. My advise as a Homoeopath is to stop going for further investigations, stop taking any medications and to approach an expert Homoeopath at the earliest. He will take her case in detail, understand her mental make up, physical make up and will prescribe a genetic constitutional remedy which will remove the lump in her breast.

I m older, this hasn t been the case. I don t remember breaking it, but who knows. But I already had cancer. So I go to the doc and have a scan. We don t know what it is says doc, but it isn t cancer. We can have it removed if it gets bigger or causes discomfort. Not being a surgery buff, I decide no to the knife. Recently I had to take care of my ailing nonegenarian father. To my amazement, both of his lowest ribs are protruding and disfigured as if mass has grown on them. I ask the nurses and they said they had not seen this before. I know he also didn t have that in youth. We were avid swimmers with large lung capacities. So, is this anything? Since my father was in his nineties, I am not as scared about it as before. Any clues?","Doctor":"Hello friend, I am a Homoeopath and agree with your decision not to thrust a knife on your chest. The tumour on your rib is a defence mechanism of your body attempting to resolve a conflict. The tendency to develop tumours on the body is genetically determined and can be caused now by some conflicts. This is proved by the presence of similar growth on the chest of your father. Once you get worried about them they become more prominent and start troubling you. As long as you know very well what exactly stimulated the body to develop the tumour, you can mentally resolve the issue. Along with that my advise is to consult an expert Homoeopath who can take your case in detail and find suitable remedies. This will regress the onward development of the tumour and will mentally and physically give health and comfort. With best wishes for a better health status,Dr. C. J.

Your doctors have diagnosed it as fat deposition. Then why are you worrying. It may be a lipoma. But soreness is quite abnormal finding.  An imaging will clear the doubt, but if diagnosis is evident clinically then imaging may not be necessary.

I have been getting a slight sore throat that only last like an hour the past two days. Me and my bf did have unprotected sex and he did go inside me on may 23 but about four days later i took the plan b pill also i was on my period from may 18 till the 21 then i bleed for two days two weeks after that period was over..i have tooken a pregnancy test and it came back negative..im just really wondering what is going on bc the stomach cramping and back cramping is dull but uncomfortable along with the bloating. If you could please tell me any possiblities that could be wrong i would really appricate it..it almost feels like gas but i really dont know also last night my colon was like throbbing in pain for like thirty mins i tired to take a bowl movement but nothing came out.","Doctor":"Hi there,Ideally Plan B should be taken within 72 hours after unprotected intercourse. In your case you took it 4 days later; which means plan B could be ineffective.However, if your menstrual cycles are usually regular, the chances of pregnancy is less if you had your periods from may 18-may 21 and intercourse on may 23.I am unable to understand what you meant by ' i bleed for 2 days 2 weeks after that period was over'.It is quite possible that your periods must be nearing which might explain the headache and cramping, bloating sensation.I would advise you to drink warm water at regular intervals. It will help with the digestion.A drug combination of mefenamic acid- dicyclomine be helpful in relieving in the cramps/colicky pain.The bloating sensation etc might be relieved with Gelusil MPS.Regular exercise for 30 minutes a day 5 days a week.If the symptoms get worse please visit your doctor. Most likely the symptoms you have might be due to the periods going to arrive shortly !Hope this helps.Regards,Dr. Divya Kuttikrishnan"},{"Patient":"sir, I was examined by an urologist before 10 days(on 6/5/2013) for a lump attached to the upper part of my left testicle which was there since 11 years and he said that it is nothing but an epididymic cyst (also he saw the ultrasound report which was done on 26/04/2013 which is attached with this). But said that before seeing the ultrasound report he is sure about the diagnosis and he confirmed it after seeing the ultrasound report. He said that it is not harmful and can be left as it is. If it pains in future then it will be removed by surgery. Today(17/05/2013), when I saw my scrotum (during bath and also after bath) I saw that the skin on that said lump sometimes appears more smooth than the skins on other part of scrotum and some times looks more rough than skin on other areas on testicle. I don't know whether it is psychological or it is cancer ? The urologist said me that there is no cancer in my testicle but can it develop within this period of 10 days ? Sometimes I fell a mild pain for a while when I sit with streatch. During other times there is a mild pain on the testiclular area  but it is very very less frequent.

You have visited an ENT specialist, a Neurologist and a Dentist; none of them have detected any cancer; hence cancer should be highly unlikely. Moreover, your Dentist seems to be suggesting that your ear pain could be due to TMJ arthritis; which could be true. In that case eat soft foods and do not chew on that side for couple of weeks.

Viral illness id self limiting & with time it will settle - take paracetamol, lot of warm to hot fluids & rest is what is needed.Smoking is a predisposing factor for development of throat (difficult swallowing, weight loss change in voice)Oral cancer causes non healing ulcer in mouth which can be painless also some times & also can lead to difficuty with speech & swallowing .Lung cancer is suspected if one has chronic cough with blood stained sputum, chest pain & shortness of breath.I hope this helps to alleviate your concerns but overall it will give you lot of health benefits if you are successful in stopping smoking."},{"Patient":"Sir my mother aged 66 years is a cancer patient and her treatment is going on TMH Mumbai since March' 2012.

I'm worried she might be showing symptoms of breast cancer or a pending heart attack. She's been under a lot of stress and has gone through a lot these past 5 months, is there a possible chance that these pains are a result of stress? Also, my mother's sister and mother were diagnosed and both died of breast cancer, so it's in the family. I've been begging her to go get a mammogram and a blood test. She finally agreed to it and went to the clinic for a blood test today--the results will be out in 10 days and then she'd go ahead and get a mammogram.

I am doing very well today. Recently, I considered have implants on my upper teeth but was told I would need 30 days of HBO therapy for the extraction of one remaining tooth. The rest of the teeth I still had after the radiation mainly just fell out except for this one tooth.Thirty days of HBO therapy seemed like \\"overkill\\" for one tooth so sought a second opinion. The second dentist agreed with me that it was overkill and extracted the tooth and fitted me for uppers (I had decide against implants). The site of the extraction bothered me over the next few months. The area was sensitive to the touch and felt like there was a lump in the at the site of the extration. I went back to him and he took x-rays. He found one of the roots was still there. He made a small incision and pulled the root out. Here's my problem today. That area is still somewhat  sensitive (it's been about 6 weeks since removing the root) and at times it throbs, especially during the night, however, it is not unbearable.  Also, at times, when eating, I feel like my nose is running and it's blood coming from my left nostril (same side where tooth was extracted) only not dark red blood, but a pinkish color. It only seems to happen when taking a large bite, like out of a sandwich. I like my dentist, but should I seek another opinion and if so, what type of dentist or specialist? In your opinion, should I have had the HBO therapy. By the way, my first dentist called the oncologist and he said I had the maximum amount of radiation in the area. Thank you and I'm anxiously awaiting a reply.","Doctor":"Dear,Since you had radiation in facial region for cancer, firstly I should congratulate you that the disease has not recured in these 10 yrs. and you are cured.radiation treatment causes fibrosis and radionecrosis of teeth which fall after exposure to radiation. if a small or major surgery is done in the irradiated area there will be very much delayed wound healing and infection.secondly the irradiated area becomes dry and cracks occur on the area leading to parial bleeding or oozing.you should use hygenic lubricating agents in consultation with your doctor to prevent further cracking, you should avoid any further surgical procedure and have conventional treatment from your dentist and slowly your problem will be redressed.I hope you got my point.Truly,dr. j.

It can be a bony swelling or enlarged lymph node. If it is bony swelling it is usually due to some benign bone disease and you need not worry much for that. However since you are breast cancer survivor - chances of that swelling being a malignant lymph node are also high.Supraclavicular lymph nodes are located in that area and thay can get involved in breast cancer.These lymph nodes are not seen in mammogram.You should consult your breast surgeon and undergo clinical examination.

She feels confused most of the time and  has lots of p[roblem of balancing.Can the clots of brain be completelt removed? Is there any limitation of radiations that can be given to a person? What are the traetment options available as of now for us..????looking for teh reply from your end.Regards,Shubham","Doctor":"Dear shubam,Lung cancer spread to brain is a 4th stage cancer. For lesions in the brain the best treatment is whole brain radiation which your mother is already getting. Yes there is limit to this form of treatment. maximum treatment is 15 to 20 fractions of radiation. she will definitely improve but this improvement may not lost long. suppliment  antineoplatic drugs will take further care which also she is getting. There may be some  improvement in balancing but full recovery may not happen or it may be delayed. Normally with this condition as per statistics life scan hardly exceeds 6 months. After completion of chemotherapy and radiation symptomatic management will be required.truly,Dr. j. Ticku"},{"Patient":"Hi. I have what appears like a cyst on a pressure point on the side of my foot which is extremely painful. This is ongoing for the past 7 months.

Thank you for your query.This sounds like clavus or veruca again which can grow into deep and cause intensive pain. But this cant turn cancerous because this has no malignant potential.

The side effects you mentioned are typical long term effects of treatment you received.The long-term effects of radiation depend on the technique of irradiation, the dose and the location that was irradiated.In the past typically 2 fields were given from lateral side to cover face and upper neck and a low anterior field to treat lower neck.So almost all normal tissue received radiotherapy and developed side effect.Eustachian  tube is a connection between ear and nasopharynx. Dysfunction of this tube is common and can cause repeated ear infection.Although it is on and off problem; if there is sign of infection you need to take antibiotic.Change in climate can also help as you mentioned.

Thanks for asking in Healthcare Magic.Stemzine is Prochloperazine and Endep is Amitriptylline. Prochloperazine is an anti psychotic drug used in the treatment of schizophrenia. It is also used in vertigo. Although it is very effective, in the long run, it can result in serious side effects like parkinsonism. Amitriptylline is a drug given to treat depression and also given in neuralgic pain when  the pain is severe. It can result in many side effects like dry mouth, sedation, tremor, sudden fall in BP and blurred vision. Also it should be used with caution in Diabetes.You can try Vertin or Beta histine for dizziness. Unlike Stemzine this drug has minimal side effects. It can result in sedation and rarely dry mouth and blurred vision.

She's trying to gain weight and her body could be reacting like it's taking Orlistat diet pills.I'm worried that Steatorrhea may be causing her to lose too much weight, and that a high fat diet is actually harmful to her health? any advice would be appreciated!

Since then I have visited the surgeon three times and 2 ultrasound done.  The first ultrasound was free of nodule which was done last October of 2012. The latest was last week which really scared me since it mentioned a 3x2x2 mm nodule with hypoechoic and reduced ethnogenecity.  All my blood work was normal . Last January of this year my endocrinologist started me with 75mcg.  synthroid and I'm also taking some over the counter multivitamins, 1,000 mg. of Vit.C, Vit. D3 ( which my OBGyne had prescribed ). Having mentioned this is because I want to ask three questions.     A) Is the latest report be considered recurrent ? Or it's just nothing considering I have cancer history     B) What do you mean by 3x2x2 hypoechoic reduced ethnogenicity?

History of thyroid cancer in 2008, had my gallbladder removed in 2011 and I am a type 1 diabetic. What started as sporadic in nature is pretty much consistent. Right after I eat I feel a bubble like feeling on my left side that goes down to my lower ribs. If I eat it is more obvious but it's almost always there now, just easier to feel after eating. It is not fixed by taking a gas reliever and it is not painful, just weird and uncomfortable.","Doctor":"Hi and welcome to HCM. Thank you for your querry. It sounds like stomach issue. All this is caused by high acid secretion which is found in gastritis, GERD or hiatus hernia. These disorders can cause such difficulties and you should do gastroscopy to evaluate this. Symptoms that are experienced in such conditions are pain and tightness in upper stomach, bloating, breathing difficulties, heartburn, feeling of lump and sore in throat, gurgling sound in throat, fatigue and loss of appetite. Symptoms are aggravated after meal, long sitting, leaning forward, stress and anxiety. In the beginning this is treated by changing dietary habits. You should avoid alcohol, coffee, smoking, fats and fast food, carbonated drinks and eat more milk and milk products, fruit and vegetables, boiled food and natural beverages and teas. 1 hour after meal you should not sit or lay. Also lay with elevated upper body. If you are overweight you should do often exercise. Secondly, there are antiacid medicines which are usually helpful,you should consult your GP about this. If symptoms persist,you should do gastroscopy and stomach biopsy to verify is there helicobacter pylori infection which can be treated then. Hope I have answered your query.

If PSA level starts rising in post-operative patients it almost always indicate recurrence of disease. Rising PSA can detect recurrence even before imaging tests like a bone scan or CT scan are positive Classically , a PSA rise to 0.4 after surgery has been considered a recurrence.  Rises in PSA lower than this have been considered insignificant, possible due to some left over benign prostate tissue.  More recently, the value of 0.2 has been chosen.

You appear to have symptoms are related to stress and depression. Depression can manifest with not only psychological symptoms but with a variety of physical symptoms also like: gas problem, IBS like symptoms, dyspepsia and medically unexplained somatic symptoms like abdominal pain etc. Excessive fear of cancer in-spite of reassurance by physician is a symptom of stress and depression, specially in presence of normal investigations. It is better to get evaluated by psychiatrist and start treatment accordingly. For long term control of depression following measures are helpful: relaxation exercise, medicines like SSRIs and non drug treatment like CBT. Same time do some relaxation exercise like daily brisk walk, yoga and breathing exercise, which will help you in rapid recovery. Wish you all the best.

Wish you good luck."},{"Patient":"Hi my name is Cath , i have inoperable pancreatic cancer , diagnosed 18 months ago , a week ago i had a stent fitted into my bile duct to relieve the yellowing of my skin , very dark urine and grey fatty stools , before i had the stent fitted i didn't suffer too much pain and could eat pretty well , since the stent was fitted i suffer constant pain and discomfort , and diarrea , nausia , is this pretty normal till everything settles ?","Doctor":"Hi and welcome to HCM. This isnt common and most people usually benefit from stent placement. In every case it is much better that you have stent then not. Your symptoms may be caused by your primary disease. There can be abnormality in pancreatic secretion so digestion is affected. I am sure that you ll feel better after some time,try to eat easier food, and more but smaller meals. Also ask your doctor about certain medicines for nausea and better digestion. Wish you luck."},{"Patient":"My Aunt has just been diagnosed (this past week) with Liver Cancer, though not yet sure of stage.  She is 83, 198 lbs (lost 7 lbs in last two weeks), is a 20 + yr breast cancer survivor and in overall OK health.  She was having trouble digesting food, so I took her to Dr.  They then found a tumor in her upper abdomen.  Blood work, CT and endoscopy done (nothing detected in the endoscopy).  The Dr. reached out to me last night (great Dr. - called on a Friday night @ 9:00!) to let me know to be ready for an oncology appt for his upcoming week.  What can I potentially expect?  All that I read tells me that we should be ready for a short life expectancy....  Anything I should know?  Would chemo be an option for someone like this?","Doctor":"Hi and welcome to HCM. All in all these arent good news. It is questionable is this primary liver tumour or a metastasis. But whatever it is she is definitely not able to stand liver resection or any other surgical procedure. Chemo is also questionable. But you should give your best for palliative treatment and make all this easier for her. It is hard to predict anything but life expectancy is from few months till 1 year if this is malignant.

My mother was diagnosed with Pancreatic Cancer about 9 months ago, she had a Neuroendocrine Carcinoma in the tail of the Pancreas, it was very located so the doctor was able to resect it and about tree other lynph nodes where the cancer had spread. In December of 2012 she had routine exams where she had a PET CT and it revealed that everything was all right and she was cancer free. About two weeks ago she had another routine PET CT and this one revealed that she has meths in her liver, and not just one tumor, so this time is inoperable. Is a really agressive Neuroendocrine Carcinoma type KY67. She is starting Chemotherapy (etoposide and cisplatin chemotherapy) this week so she is able to prolong her life. The thing is I would like to have a second opinion and we are not able to travel to the USA... My questions are...- How long does she have.- What are her chances of living","Doctor":"Hello Welcome to healthcaremagic. Neuro-endocrine tumor are uncommon tumors and ompared to common cancer of pancreas-adenocarcinoma ,they have relatively slower course and better outcome. It is unfortunate that your mother has aggressive type of tumor because she developed metastasis in relatively short time. Most appropriate treatment of hepatic metastasis for lung term survival is  surgery. But since her tumor in not operable she should undergo chemotherapy with frequent assessment in between to see if tumor shrinks and becomes operable. Although it is difficult to quantify her life because every person has different disease course, statistically survival in patients with hepatic metastases is 2–4 years.

Bone metastasis in spine is common problem in prostate cancer, It is staged as stage IV which is advanced stage as you rightly mentioned. Radiation therapy has been reported to be effective in palliating painful bone metastase with response in 80-90% patients. Apart from this hormonal therapy are very effective in prostate cancer which control growth of tumor and releive symptoms.

The doc believed he was going through alcohol withdrawal, and he had to be put on ventilator because he was breathing 60 times per minute and had too much carbon dioxide in his lungs.  The alcohol withdrawal started 4 days ago.  He now has pneumonia, which he did not have til after he was put on ventilator.  They are pushing antibiotics, potassium, thiamine, meropenem, fentanyl, propofol, and maintenance fluids.  They are also giving him adavant and dillatin (not sure if i spelled those two right). He has not had food in 4 days now, and is hypoglycemic. They have checked his blood multiple times and have done abdominal CTs and chest CTs looking for another source of infection because he should not still be spiking high fevers.  His fevers run from 101 to 104.  He was out in the sun for two days straight before he became ill, and was taking an anti-seizure med called Tegratol, which has a sticker on the bottle that says avoid overexposure to sunlight.  He was also apparently drinking alcohol every night, even after the fevers started.  The doctors are grasping at straws as to why he is not getting better.  Pancreatitis is under control now, and pneumonia is not bad enough to be making such high persistent fevers.  Can you think of anything that it could be that they have not checked for?  He has been in the hospital for 7 days now, and I am growing increasingly more worried.  He was breathing on his own on the ventilator in CPac mode, but this morning he started breathing too fast, so they put him back on it.","Doctor":"Hi,Thank you for your query.Though you have provided most of the details you have not mentioned the details of the basic investigations:1.

This is something that will be found on MRI in the most people older than 50 years.

In the past year or two, I have experienced significant itching all over my body, with red welts, bumps and raised areas,  especially on my arms. Could the ruptured silicon be causing the itching?","Doctor":"Dear Ma'am, Sorry to hear about your problem. Have the ruptured implants been removed? If not, they should be dealt with immediately. Silicone can cause problems but they are mainly in the local area. It is unlikely that silicone will lead to problems all over the body. For your symptoms, you should consult a dermatologist as they might be due to eczema or some generalised allergy.

After one of his TURBT's he was given pyridium. He suffered from urgency at the best of times, but when the catheter came out and of course with having to drink the extra fluids after the procedure, he was unable to hold his urine and was incontinent on my carpet. I have been unable to find anyone that knows a way to remove this stain and realize this is not really a medical question but your site popped up and I figured it was worth a try as you would probably have heard of the problem before.Thankyou so much for your consideration and time,Brenda","Doctor":"Dear Ma'am, Sorry to hear about your father's problem. Incontinence can be  a complication following TURBT. In some patients it is transient but in others it can persist for a long time. If he is having incontinence, then it is better that he is catheterised for a few days. As far as the stain is concerned, you just need to wash it a few times or get it dry cleaned.

My GP discovered the stage two medistinalMass on a chest x ray August 2006. My oncologist gave me 8 rounds of RCHOP and one month of low dose radiation to the front and back of the chest. I was given a MUGA scan before and after treatment. Fall two years ago my heart was out of rhythm it was afib. My cardiologist did a TEE and cardioversion on me. My heart went out rhythm two and a half days latter. He was going to cardiovert me again but flecainide put me in rhythm. After one full year on flecainide 50 mg twice daily my cardiologist decided to completely take me off of flecainide. He said if my heart got out of rhythm take 100 mg of flecainide. He wants me to try the \\"pill in pocket\\" approach. Well, today after one whole week off the flecainide I went out of rhythm. Do you believe the chemo and radiation was the likely cause of my afib? Do you think I will need to stay on a regular dose of flecainide to maintain rhythm? I don't like the uncertainty of living without a regular dose. What do you think the purpose was to take me off the flecainide? Is it the possible long term side effects?Thank you in advance for your advice.Diana :)","Doctor":"Dear gnassios, The chemotherapy which you have undergone contains one drug called anthracycline. This drug beyond a certain cumulative dose is known to cause some cardiac effects.  Rituximab and chest radiation have the potentiating effect. So every possiblity of post chemo radio effect leading to arrythmia. Taking flecainide continously is not harmful. The purpose that your cardiologist wanted to stop this medicine  was to see if you can do without it. Since the arrythmia recured you can continue to use the drug. There will be no long term side effects. Dr. J. Ticku"},{"Patient":"Hello i used to have ewing saracoma, i survived:D.(kicked cancers Ass!) i had radiotherapy done and had chemo about three times. My right leg did not grow ever since i was ten (im 17 now) due to radiotherapy. lately i've been experiencing a lot of symptoms that i feel like my body is trying to tell me something. In my right foot i usualy get itchy around my toes area especially in between my toes, also i've been a bit stressed lately and i find my self farting a lot, my bowl movement isnt very normal, rather its abnormal, i experince different bowel movements every time i go to the toilet, from green, brown to white round stools, i get my period heavier now and a bout a week ago i found a mysterious bruise on my arm and then a experienced a nother one in a different place.

After 2 rounds of antibiotics the swelling went away, verrrryyyy slowly.","Doctor":"Hello; Congratulations for becoming a cancer survivor. Regarding your bowel symptoms ,it is very difficult to relate them to your cancer or the treatment. They are non specific and can be due to so many different non-ancerous causes. Being more tired is common after undergoing  radiotherapy and chemotherapy. It usually subside on its own and there is no specific treatment. In the foot where you got radiation treatment ,the lymphatic drainage is altered.So you are likely to get lymphatic swelling called lymphedema.That leg is also more prone to get infection due to it.Probably you had some infection in the leg which got better with antibiotic.

Is this illness cureable,is it life long disease,thanks","Doctor":"Hi, If your stool is bloody and you have stool evacuation more than 8 times daily, you should make sure you are not just losing blood with your stool. You'd need to do a lab. test for a sample of your stool for blood and microbiology as well as do blood tests - full blood count, Hb, prothrombin time. It would also be good to know which ayurvedic remedies you are taking. Apart from blood and stool tests, a specific type of scanning would be helpful in order to closer diagnose your disease and the health condition of your gastro-intestinal system as well as specific types of treatment, including the oral intake of medications, introduction of medications into the rectum and colon, colon hydrotherapy with medications, low level laser therapy, laser puncture and/or reflexotherapy and specific medications that could stop bleeding and regulate your intestinal functions."},{"Patient":"Last year I had microcalifications in my left breast. I had the area removed and thank God it was benign.  This year I went for my routine mammogram and this time they found the exact same thing on my right breast.  I had a stereotatic biopsy on yesterday and I am currently waiting for the results.  I am a 48 year old african american woman with two children. I had a total hysterectomy May of 2012.  Should I be concerned about this reoccurence?  Is this something that is stress relateed?  Diet related?  Is this like a pre-cursor to breast cancer?  I do have a history of breast cancer in my family on my mother's side. She had two sisters that had breast cancer and both have passed away.","Doctor":"Hello Breast calcification is a common finding in mammogram. Most of the time it is benign process but sometimes this can be due to cancer.There are 2 types of calcification. Macrocalcification is usually benign and needs no further test but microcalcification can be benign which is the case in 80% of lesion or can be cancerous. So for confirmation or if it looks doubtful you have to do repeat mammogram or biopsy. It is good that you have undergone biopsy an it will give you definite answer.

But I am concerned about her lack of being able to get out and do things as cause a kidney stone or cause some other type of problem.","Doctor":"hi,thank you for your queryhysterectomy can be done either laproscopically or abdominally or vaginally..laproscopic hysterectomines have lesser postop pain compared to the other two methods.hence during post op period experiencing pain is common.Recovery from open abdominal hysterectomy usually takes 6-8 weeks. Recovery time will be quicker for other methods.bleeding along with pain can also be expected in this time for few days. i can suggest few simple tips to reduce pain and any complications..1.During the first two to three weeks, rest and avoid lifting.2.Slowly increase your activities. Begin with light chores and short walks. 3.Depending on your job, you may be able to return to work.4.to promote healing, eat a diet rich in fruits and vegetables .5.Try to avoid constipation by: Eating high-fiber foods,Drinking plenty of water6.Using stool softeners if needed7.Ask your doctor when you can use tampons.8.ask about Kegel exercises.by drinking loads of fluids your mother will cut down on the risk of developing kidney stone.and mild walking will help keep her mobile.but start these activities gradually and slowly.thank you,wishing you good health"},{"Patient":"About 4 weeks ago I developed a sore throat while swallowing in the area of my esophagus, right hand side. It happened a couple of days after I bit my tongue very badly. My tongue was bitten so badly that it was I felt excruciating pain on my tongue when trying to swallow due to my tongue rubbing against my teeth. About 2 days later my throat got very sore.  I assumed it was because I was trying not to swallow.  Well, 4 weeks later my throat is still sore though not as bad.  It seems to have hit a pain plateau in that it's mild pain but it's not getting better.  It's only on the right hand side and it only hurts when swallowing saliva, not food or liquid.  Also, if I put pressure on my neck at the area of pain it doesn't hurt when I swallow.  I have no difficulty swallowing and don't feel any sense of a lump in my throat.  Saw an ENT but his scope didn't go down into esophagus.  Very scared that I have esophageal cancer.  I'm hoping to get into another ENT to get a transnasal esophagoscopy, but that could take awhile due to referrals, insurance approval, etc.  Are there benign causes for what I'm experiencing?  (I don't have acid reflux as far as I know).  Oh, and I've been taking antibiotics for 5 days but that seems to be making it worse.","Doctor":"Hello From the problems you have explained it is very unlikely that you have esophageal caner. Tongue problem seems unrelated to your sore throat. Anxiety can cause these type of symptom.Another common cause is viral infections.Antibiotics don't help when you have viral infections.

Have you undergone blood test,chest x ray and cultures to see if you have any infection or not. A endoscopic examination of head & neck and/or CT scan of neck can tell wether you have recurrence or not. In patient who have recurrence in neck they usually have swollen lymph node in neck.

It can be given along with cancer treatment, or can even be cancer treatment. The aim  of palliative care is to improve the quality of your life, or help you feel as good as you can for as long as you can.

It is not possible to tell about type of tumor from size because sometimes even small tumor are cancerous while big tumor can be non-cancerous. One way of knowing what type of nodule you have is looking at BIRADS catagory of lesion.It is nothing but standard way of catagorizing finding of mammogram in scale of 0-6 Category     Diagnosis     Number of Criteria 0     Incomplete     Your mammogram or ultrasound didn't give the radiologist enough information to make a clear diagnosis; follow-up imaging is necessary 1     Negative     There is nothing to comment on; routine screening recommended 2     Benign     A definite benign finding; routine screening recommended 3     Probably Benign     Findings that have a high probability of being benign (>98%); six-month short interval follow-up 4     Suspicious Abnormality     Not characteristic of breast cancer, but reasonable probability of being malignant (3 to 94%); biopsy should be considered 5     Highly Suspicious of Malignancy     Lesion that has a high probability of being malignant (>= 95%); take appropriate action 6     Known Biopsy Proven Malignancy     Lesions known to be malignant that are being imaged prior to definitive treatment; assure that treatment is completed If the lesion is suspicious,doctor will do Fine needle aspiration cytology  to determine type of the nodule.

Mark on your calendar when symptoms seem to flare up, like headaches, bloating, or pain.it will show you how close to ovulation some symptoms happen, which in turn will help decide your treatment.2.Pain relievers, including acetaminophen/paracetamol, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs such as ibuprofen canbe taken.3.A warm bath, or heating pad, or hot water bottle applied to the lower abdomen near the ovaries can relax tense muscles and relieve cramping, lessen discomfort, and stimulate circulation and healing in the ovariesbut as i said if the pain is extreme or sudden pain, associated with heavy bleeding, or other concerns, don't wait and see if it will go away.cosnult your OB/GYN immediatelythank you,wishing you good health"},{"Patient":"Hi, I have had a 3mm lesion excision for my top lip.

It appears that you don't have breast cancer because if your mammogram show some abnormality suggestive of cancer,you need to do biopsy and receive srurery/radiotherapy /chemotherapy not follow up. Most probalbly they were talking about BIRADS classification No 4. BIRADS is  'breast imaging reporting and data system', and was established by the American College of Radiology. BIRADS is used to classify mammogram finding into numerical catagory. The BI-RADS assessment categories are: 0- incomplete, 1- negative, 2-benign findings, 3-probably benign, 4-suspicious abnormality, 5-highly suspicious of malignancy, 6-known biopsy with proven malignancy.

The emnlargement of spleen has many other causes and can be ruled out by simple ultrasonography.Headache, shoulderache, leg cramps have many other causes like hypertension, anaemia, nutritional deficiency essential nutrients and minerals like magnessium, calcium, Vit B1, B12and so on. Another imp. factor may be stress related. These all need to be ruled out and patient reassured and Iam sure these symptoms will wane off. with good nutrtious diet and reaaurance.

I also have small red dots on my stomach that short of resemble pimples, but are not popable and do not go away. And I have noticed more and more appear over the last four to five months. My question is, could this be related to colon cancer? Or does it sound like it might be?","Doctor":"Hello! Thank you for the query. Symptoms which can point to colon cancer are constipation and narrow stools. Pimples on the stomach are rather not related to colon cancer. You should be aware of colon cancer if you are older than 50, have had colon cancer in the family. If you are quite young person, colon cancer is rather unlikely. Other symptoms of colon cancer are: weight lost, blood in stool, nausea, vomiting, bloating, constipation and diarrhea alternately, weakness, low hemoglobin level. Other diseases which can cause constipation are chronic bacterial infection, bad diet (lack of fiber rich products and mineral water intake), medicines (Ca-blockers, antidepresants), thyroid disease. I suggest you to visit your doctor and have some diagnostics performed. If you are around 50, colonoscopy should be done. If you are young person, FOBT (fecal occult blood test) should be fine.

This has to be followed if necessary by local radiation therapy and systemic chemotherapy. If surgery does not leave any residual disease then only systemic adjuant chemotherapy may be considered. The clear understanding will be there when we have post surgical and pathological details. Surgery is the best option. if the disease is completely resected out he may need adjuant systemic chemotherapy. If residual disease was left  after surgery ne may need external radiotherapy as wel.

TSH supression therapy involves giving higher dose of thyroxin medication so that TSH level is very low(less than 0.5mU/L).When  amount of TSH in your body is low , your thyroid gland stops growing as well as tumor. However TSH supression has unwanted effects especially on heart and bone and risk increases as your age increase. Moreove people having low risk disease do not benifit mush from TSH supression therapy. So your doctor have shifted from supression to replacement.In this you take lower amount of thyroxin medication,as a replacement of natural thyroid hormone  so that your TSH is in normal range. You need to take thyroxin because your thyroid gland was removed. You should visit your doctor periodically and there is no need to worry about TSH level.

But if there is redness around it or it is fixed to background or growing fast then you hsould visit specialist. If this is soft and movable then it can be lymph node or lipoma.

They have long course and are less responsive to traditional anti-cancer therapy like radiotherapy and chemotherapy. Somatostatin analogues like octreotide LAR   have been utilized to reduce the gastrin/hromogranin levels and have been shown to reduce recurrences, yet its use is not routine.

If you have a strong family history of cancer, you should get regular colonoscopies done. If you are suffering from pain in the abdomen it is best to get it evaluated by a gastric surgeon.

He has had 11 treatments of radiation and chemo of 25 but had to stop because of sickness. Time is of the essence, and they had talked of a whipple procedure op, but have now backtracked. Could he ask for a gall bladder removal and rerouting or replacement of any damaged part of the bile duct. Its knowing the right questions to ask? Is this the best option given that the patient is a fit 62 year old and a lot to live for. Very interested to know your opinion. Janet","Doctor":"Hello, Very sorry to learn that your brother in law is suffering from cancer and most likely it is pancreatic cancer.Since he was not a surgical candidate,your brother in law was subjected to radiation and chemotherapy.biliary stenting means that bile duct got blocked because of local advancement of cancer resulting in pressure on bile duct from surrounding mass of cancer. Whipple's procedure was also cancelled because doctors must have realised that locally cancer was very much advanced and surgery is not feasible. Since all near structures are matted with cancerous cells,no surgery is possible. You should not disturb anything now and let live your brother in law peacefully in his final journey. Overall, pancreatic cancer has a poor prognosis. Of all those people diagnosed with pancreatic cancer, only 20% are alive 1 year later. Sadly, only about 5 % live  for 5 years after diagnosis. For people diagnosed with locally advanced disease, which cannot be removed by an operation, the average life expectancy is about 7 months. For people whose cancer has already spread to another part of their body, the average life expectancy is only a few months.

I have regular smear tests since with negative results. I am worried about cancer. I hSve no pain with it.Thank you Caroline sproule","Doctor":"Hi and thanks for the query, Bleeding outside your periods deserve a careful evaluation. Considering the fact you have had an abnormal smear before, this becomes very compelling. However, the commonest symptom instead in cervical cancer is usually bleeding after sexual intercourse, however, this is not seen in all cases. It would first of all be important to know if you are on any birth control method or not. If not, you might need to do a pregnancy test to exclude a miscarriage. As females approach menopause however, it is not unusual to experience some abnormalities in bleeding patterns. Its of utmost importance to consult your gynecologist to get first an abdominal and pelvic ultrasound to ascertain the integrity of the ovaries and the texture of the uterus. Common causes of bleeding such as fibroids must also be excluded. An examination called a hysteroscopy might be needed at some point in time to visualize the uterus and see if there exists any abnormal growths inside. Booking an appointment with your gynecologist is my advice as I wish you the best of health.

I am in great pain. doctor recommended me antibiotics which I took but no relive. now she has suggested me to go for ultrasound for cancer. please guide me what is it and how I get rid of pain and bump.","Doctor":"Dear Ma'am, Sorry to hear about your problem. You are probably suffering from a lactational breast abscess, which needs to be treated with antibiotics and drainage of the pus. Sometimes a breast abscess can mimic a breast carcinoma as well and there is no harm in getting it evaluated by an ultrasound and a biopsy of the lump. You should visit a surgeon and have it evaluated immediately. Hoping for the best."},{"Patient":"Hi, my mother was diagnosed with breast cancer twenty years ago and had both breasts and lymph nodes under the arm removed. Over the past few months she has been having pain under her right armpit and upper breast area. The pain started out as being mild but over the last month has gotten worse to the point now that is an almost constant throbbing pain. It is painful to the point that she dreads dressing and putting on a bra. She has been without an oncologist the past few years but she is scheduling an appointment with a new oncologist tommorow. If you wouldn't mind giving any advice it would be greatly appreciated. Thanks","Doctor":"Dear Ma'am, Sorry to hear about your mother's problem. If the pain has developed recently (keeping the history of breast cancer in mind) it is better to get it evaluated by an oncologist to rule out a recurrence. This can be ruled out by doing an USG/MRI of that area. Once recurrence is ruled out, other causes of pain like neuropathy can be evaluated. Hoping for the best."},{"Patient":"hi, I'm 21 years old, have a 20 month old daughter and have just discovered some information about breast cancer that has me a little worried. I have 2 small, hard lumps on my left armpit and my left breast is a full cup size bigger than the other. I would say it became larger after having my daughter. I am a little concerned about going to the doctors and it all being nothing. I am 5\\"2 and around 12 stone in weight. I have had the 2 lumps for over 2 years now, but only had the larger breast since my daughters birth. Am I worrying over nothing? Many thanks in advance. P.S I have always used spray deodrants and I am a smoker of around 5 a day.","Doctor":"Dear Ma'am, Sorry to hear about your problem. Considering your description of the lumps, it is better that you have them evaluated by a breast surgeon. It is better to have a diagnosis of a benign lump than to miss a malignant lump. Hard lumps are suggestive of cancer and it is best that an ultrasound of the breast is done to characterize them Hoping for the best."},{"Patient":"i am 69 years of age male .After no illness at all in my life so far i have been told I am anaemic , my blood count has dropped by 30% .I have been prescribed iron tablets for an 8 week period .i have had no blood loss , have taken part in the bowel cancer tests for 2 to 3 years without any issues detected .What are the usual reason for this to happen at this stage?I am eating veg , liver , steak  ,dried apricots to get iron into my system and was considering having 3 pints of guinness a  week ( does it help ? )I walk 4 miles most days.Can you advise why this may have occurred , Thanks Brian Lilley","Doctor":"Dear Brian Lilley, Firstly I would like to know if  you have any symtom of palpitation(FAST HEART BEAT), shortness of breath, mild headache or insufficient sleep. If Yes possibly you are anaemic. There are many reasons of anaemia one of which is nutritional defficiency caused by less intake or less absorption in your body which is ruled out as you say but worm infestation has also to be ruled out.. Other cause may be low production of blood cells from bone marrow or the blood cells are quickly destroyed. Firstly a complete blood count with peripheral smear examination is needed to have the basic clue about the type of  anaemia you have. you can go for further investigations for which CBC will be the guide and we can determine what type of anaemia you have. Your primary physician will guide you accordingly. Truly, Dr. Ticku Clinical Onc and hematologist."},{"Patient":"My mom has lost 60 pounds in 2 years. She hurts extremely bad under her ribs and back.

Leukemia isnt the first thing to thnk of. Unexplained bruises is common symptoms and most causes are benign such as trombocytopenia or clotting factors defficiency.

As she begins to eat, she may feel better. Hope this helps."},{"Patient":"Suffering from Mouth ulcers , I had Antibiotics and Vitamin tables like bcomplex and tried eating veggies, Rinsed with Solution advised by Doctor, and salt water too rinsed, now am suffering lot, with 10 mouth ulcers inside, pls suggest..","Doctor":"Hi, Thanks for asking the query, Your clinical history and symptoms suggest that you are suffering from recurrent apthous ulcers. This occurs due to many factors like immunologic abnormalities,iron, vitamin D, folic acid deficiency, traumatic incidents like self inflicted bites,tooth brushing and dental trauma, hormonal changes. Get thorough clinical examination done. Apply 1.5% of cortisone acetate topically over the affected area. Take vitamin B suplements, avoid intake of hot and spicy food stuffs. Use saline water gargles 3-4 times a day to give soothing effects. Use antiseptic mouthwash solution like chlorhexidinewhich provides numbing effects, helps in faster healing and relieves pain. Take balanced diet, include plenty of raw green leafy vegetables, carrots,salads, fruits like oranges, lemon. Drink plenty of water and keep yourself hydrated. Hope this helps out.

Secondary bone cancer in a female is mostly from breast, lung, kidney or thyroid. Pelvic tumors spreading to bone is rare. The pelvic tumor may itself be a secondary. She needs CT scan thorax and abdomen, mammography and thyroid ultrasound to locate the primary. A few special tests (immunos) on the biopsy can also tell something about possible primary. The prognosis depends on the primary site. For example, it is better in breast or thyroid. She also needs radiation to the larger skull deposit. Best wishes."},{"Patient":"hi, I am a 51 year old fairly active woman, residing in North Western Ontario, Canada. Yesterday my lower neck, and the region between my shoulders started to have sudden onset of pain, but only seems to bother me when I take a deep breath or have to cough?? Is more annoying than anything as the pain is sharp and catches me off guard. As it is the easter weekend, I can not contact my family doctor til tuesday, and don t feel it is serious enough to seek attention at the regional hospital. I did undergo breast cancer treatment , surgery, chemo and radiation 2 years ago. Had 27 lymph nodes removed under my left arm. My question is : do we have lymph nodes in the back of our neck, and can they become inflamed. THis pain almost feels like swollen glands in my throat, when I have had tonsillitis , or strep throat . Seems weird. |Thanks for your help. Janet","Doctor":"Hi Thanks for writing in. You have not mentioned about the details of your breast cancer treatment (like size of tumor, grade, receptor status, node positivity, etc). These are required to understand the risks of it coming back. The possibilities of this kind of pain may be infection in the throat, muscular or skeletal pain unrelated to cancer, or spread of breast cancer to bones or pleura (in the chest). You certainly need a physical examination and may be a few tests to diagnose the exact condition.

Lately, i ve had this twicting around my entire right eye. it s not constant, but when it happens, i can actually feel it jumping & it s very scary. what could it be?","Doctor":"The twitching in your eye may or may not be related to the lymphoma. It is more likely that there is a disturbance in the nerve which supplies the eye. The reason for this needs to be investigated. This may be the cause you are having twiching in your eye. You should consult with your doctor who can examine you and treat accordingly."},{"Patient":"Hi my mum has stage four bowel cancer which has spread to the liver and to the peretoneum. Operations weren t an option as the cancer has spread too far, she tried chemo back in November but was no point in continuing as the pain and after effects were too horrific. She is doing really good seeing as her oncologist said she should be dead by now, mum feels it is the supplements that are helping to boost her immune system . Her feet have become quite swollen the last few days, is this from the tumours and part of the body breaking down or is it more circulation and she needs to try and move her feet more? thank you","Doctor":"Hi and welcoe to HCM. I am sorry that you re confronting with such serious disease,but I am glad that your mum feels good. It is always hard to predict every malignant disease. Swollen legs can be caused by tumor pressure on pelvic veins,and this isnt uncommon. But also you should look for heart and kidney disease because both can cause swollen feet. Whatever it is she should lie with elevated leg,can put some pillow undernetah and do feet exercise. For the beginning blood pressure and echocardiography and basic labs would be good to evaluate kidny and heart function,although those swelling arent gonna hurt her very much if this isnt exreme.

In a year and a half I took her to about 68 DR appts with her family physician and maybe 20 hospital ER visits only to be told she was suffering from long-term phnemonia COPD and respiratory problems. Then she had severe pain in her left shoulder so I took her in and they said she had a fracture on the left shoulder.We told the Dr. that she didn t fall or bump into anything. We couldnt belive she had a fracture. So we thought nothing of it and we would all joke about how she was always lazy lately and never got off the couch so how could it be possible that she broke it doing nothing? Well some time passed and the shoulder was not improving. The Dr, referred mom to an orthopedic but with so many mistakes on the referall it took them 8 months to get her in for an appt. Well they did defiantly diagnose her with a shoulder fracture and nothing more. So a couple weeks go by mom has not had a bowel movement in 10 days, so I make a trip to the ER and they gave her a pill and meds rectally and sent her home. Three days later still no bowl movement, so i call the Dr and showed them how serious this was to me that she goes to the bathroom or he is going to have to admit her. Around that time she also stopped eating and drinking alot. She lost like 30 lbs in 10 to 15 days. Her cough was like something I had never heard before, . She had been on the nebulizer for 4 months to just be able to breathe. I made another appt to her Dr.and he gives meds to deal with her nausea and says to me that the rest of the symptoms is because of her mental illness {bi-polar}. She had been chocking on her own saliva that she swollowed for a year and had a swallow test done and didn t get any abnormal results, Two days later I find her almost dead in the living room and rush her in to the emergency room which would be her last visit to the hospital and be her final resting place. There they found that she had cancer in lungs, liver, kidneys, throat, abdomen, and was starting in the brain. The pneumonia never got better because the cover that covers the tube to her lungs didn t exist so when momma was swallowing she was feeding her lungs with the fluids. My mom died a painful death and suffered alot after four days of being diagnosed with stage IV lung cancer . When she was admitted and told that she Adenocarcinoma: which this type of cancer begins in the mucus-producing cells in the lungs..When it spreads, it often spreads to the brain. It will also metastasize to the lymph nodes, the liver, the adrenal glands and bone. It wasnt enough time for her to fight nor us to prepare and I find that there were so many signs leading to cancer that the Dr. could have checked and let my mother have a chance at life and fight cancer. That day my mother passed away in my arms is the day a part of me died. Time was not on my moms side nor was her dr that we both trusted her life with. I need answers and I need justice. Is that wrong? I think she was worth being able to fight cancer and that was robbed from her due to negligence from her Dr., Am I wrong? IS it malpractice or just bad luck??? I need closure.Please help me.Im lost without","Doctor":"Hi Larared sorry to hear about your mom and I can feel your concern. Non resolving pneumonia should be worked up and malignancy is one cause of this...I don't know to what extent it was pneumonia radiologically and was it followed up properly or not. A significant weight loss should prompt a clinician to aearch for cancer. Stage 4 lung cancer means it has metastasized or spread to different parts of the body including liver, adrenals, bone, brain etc....and that would have been cause of pathological frature you stated. In your case it is yet to find out that where was the primary ....was it in alimentary system because there were symptoms of GI disturbance or was it in the lung itself and has spread to the two parts vice versa. Now regarding the treatment stage 4 lung cancer requires Only palliative treatment i.e palliative chemotherapy can be given and that too depends on the general condition of the patient called performance scores.

The node pushing on your throat is probably due to spread from your lung. You may need imaging studies to identify the cancerous areas and the mode of treatment whether surgical, radiotherapy or chemotherapy or a mix of these has to be decided.

The symptoms you are describing along with your history of smoking and alcohol consumption does raise a suspicion of cancer. It is best that you get yourself evaluated by a doctor without any delay.

The staging can only be done after a few imaging tests (CT, X-ray chest, etc). You should also inquire from the surgeon about the management plan once the staging is over.

There are many causes of low Hb and cancer is not one of the common ones. She should undergo a peripheral smear to see the exact cause of her low Hb.

CYSTIC GLANDULAR HYPERPLASIA OF ENDOMETRIUM = Fluid filled glands with little bit thickened  inner skin/layer of uterus. Now as far as the clinical research is concerned their are data supporting that its \\" NOT A CANCER\\" but classified as \\"PRE-CANCEROUS\\" Now pre cancerous means it not A CANCER per say but may convert to cancer in future , provided the same stress full condition (for e.g. - smoking shows some pre cancerous changes but , ofter detection the pre cancerous stage , person still keeps on smoking then definitely he will have cancer in future and here the smoking is considered as STRESS FACTOR for the mouth cells) So in our case the ESTROGEN is the stress for causing CYSTIC GLANDULAR HYPERPLASIA OF ENDOMETRIUM which is a \\"PRE-CANCEROUS \\", Now as your are already about the be a menopause / stop your period cycle , is good news as far as this hyperplasia is concerned , so due to menopause the circulating estrogen in the blood decreases as well as new production of estrogen (which is stress/cause) will decreased drastically. ADVICE: Hence , PLEASE FEEL SAFE  that you WILL NOT have a CANCER , BUT its important to keep an eye on the lesion, so biopsy will be needed every year for first 2 years and then can be switched to once ever 3 to 4 year. depending upon the doctors opinion.

What might be the problem.?","Doctor":"hi my dear, thank you for your questionpain and dyscomfort especially in the lower abdomen could indeed signify an infection(STD), as these infections usually manifest more a few days after menses. the reason for this is the the germs multiply rapidly in blood, and might begin to manifest after your flow.your should see your gynecologist for examination and testing, including a pelvic ultrasound.thanks"},{"Patient":"My mother has adenocarcinoma of the duodenum . She had a whipple. Due to sepsis after the whipple, she was unable to receive any treatment ( chemo ) for her cancer. We were following her with serial CT scans. About 3 months ago, her cancer was found to be metastasized to her liver and all over her mesenteric cavity. She had a bile drain placed and is in hospice. She is experiencing increasing episodes of uncontrollable shaking. They are not seizures. She is fully awake and aware. She is able to respond during the episode. I gave her ativan. I also gave her candy. She wasn t eating well, and I thought that it might be a low glucose level. I have been trying to research this. I think it may be more related to her diagnosis. Can you give me any ideas?","Doctor":"In such advanced stage , body proteins get depleted and low metabolism renders extreme malaise,wasting, cachexia leading to chronic fatigue .

And I am very scared and I never had a mammogram or anything ? Wht should I do? Since I know I am most likely to get breast cancer. And now my aunt has it too! I am just scared ! And I don t have medical insurance where can I go get checked ?","Doctor":"Hello First of all, calm down. Do not worry a lot as even if your Mother and your aunty got breast cancer, does not mean that you are going to get breast cancer. Every person has genes which can cause cancer but there are genes which stop cancer from starting. The most common cause of pulsating pain in breast can be when you would be having your menses in a week's time. To check whether your breasts are normal, use your palm and feel your breasts with your palm and move your palm in a clockwise direction from sides to the center of nipple and then in anticlockwise direction from nipple to side. In this movement, if you feel everything as soft, then there is nothing to worry. In the end, to remove out any doubts, you can have a mammogram done. Mammogram is a easy procedure and is painless too. It is just a Ultrasound sonography of the breasts. All your doubts will get cleared by a mammogram. Regards Take care"},{"Patient":"My brother noticed a small lump on left side of neck about 3 weeks ago. Since then, it has grown to be 2.6 cm per ct scan and it is a solid hard mass. he has a swollen ear canal due to this they told him and now has a sore throat on that side. no pain unless it is touched, He is scheduled for biopsy as per ct results this week. What are the signs of cancer?","Doctor":"Hi thanks for your question. The lump on left side of neck your brother is having most probably could be an enlarged cervical ltmph node secondary to his ear and throat infection.Lymph nodes get enlarged when ever there is infection in their vicinity.Chances of this lump to be a cancer are very less as this is associated with ear infection and pharyngitis (infection of throat)  although cannot be ruled out altogether.Cancer can be ruled out only by biopsy. Hope this answers your question."},{"Patient":"I have a wart type lesion near the opening of my vagina it s of greyish color and itches slightly if I touch it, or is irritated, has grown in size, and can be moved around. I don t have any other symptoms though, and am pregnant and worried it may effect birth or could be cancerous. Because It just appeared out of nowhere, and has been there for a couple months now.","Doctor":"Thank you for your query. Most wart type lesions are caused by viruses. If not a wart it will be caused by a different infective agent, fungus or bacteria. I do not think this is cancer, but having said that it should still be treated by a doctor to prevent future complications. This should have no impact on your ability to normal labour, but again it is best to treat it to minimize the risk of infecting the baby during the birth process. I trust this information is helpful."},{"Patient":"what are the chances of my breast cancer stage 2 returning if I discontinue femara. I had one lymph node withcancer. I have been taking femara for about one year. I am 73 years old and still have my ovaries, after a hysterectomy in my fifties. I have been toke to take femara for 3 years. Thank you, Pamela","Doctor":"Dear Ma'am, Sorry to hear about your problem. Femara reduces the chances of cancer coming back by almost 40% and also prevents the risk of getting cancer in the other breast. If you discontinue this medicine, there is a significant chance of the cancer coming back. Did you receive chemotherapy after your surgery? If no chemotherapy was given, then it is all the more important that you continue taking femara. The total duration of treatment with femara is 5 years. I hope I have answered your question.

I have an ECG that shows (when compared to an ECG in 1998) the presence of an anteroseptal infarction . Should the Class I, II or III chemotherapy agents even be considered in my situation? I am not interested in contributing to statistical longevity but in quality of life. The tumor is ER+, PR+, HER-2 CISH amplified 9 and oncotype DX score of 29. Should the silver bullet herceptin even be considered?","Doctor":"Hi Thanks for writing in. Because of your age, cardiac disease and emphasis on quality of life, I would not recommend chemo for you. However I would strongly recommend endocrine therapy with aromatase inhibitor (anastrozole, letrozole or exemestane) for 5 years as these are the mainstay of therapy in lobular carcinoma at your age. Herceptin may be considered but only if the cardiac ejection fraction on echocardiography is fine and that too with very careful cardiac monitoring during therapy.

There is a possibility that your cancer is now not sensitive to hormone therapy any more. I would suggest imaging studies to rule out any evidence of recurrence of the tumor (like MRI pelvis, CT thorax and bone scans). Further treatment in the case of visible disease on scans or persistently rising PSA, may include other hormonal agents or chemotherapy if need be. Best Wishes,"},{"Patient":"I have a cough with a choking sensation especially when trying to sleep. It feels as if sand is in my throat . My Dr. Said its probably sinus problems, so I take Flonaise. Initially a little relief, but it s back. What causes this? I admittedly am a 4 cig/day smoker, which I m trying to quit. I m afraid it s throat cancer or something more serious.","Doctor":"Hello! Thank you for the query. Smoking makes you prone to many lungs diseases including severe inflammation, COPD (Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease) and lung cancer. Throat cancer is also possible. All this diseases give cough so without additional tests you are unable to rule them out. That is why I suggest you to visit pulmunologist, have chest X-ray (or better chest CT) and spirometry (blow test). Laryngologist can diagnose throat cancer. Hope this will help.

She is bedridden now due to pain in back (from lungs) and in hip from cancer . She is 48 years old. She is choosing to do the hip replacement as she believes it will relieve her hip pain and keep her from being in a wheelchair the rest of her life. We are concerned as to whether the risk of surgery is worth the hip replacement. Oncologist estimates 3-4 months survival without chemo and with chemo, if she reacts most favorably, up to 2 years. Any opinion?","Doctor":"Dear Ma'am, Sorry to hear about your sister-in law's problem. Triple negative cancer is a bad disease to have and is usually has a bad prognosis. In her case with the extensive mets present all over the body, it is not advisable to go for such an extensive surgery (hip replacement). The healing power of the body is also affected in cancer and the body might not be able to sustain such a procedure. It is better that she receives chemotherapy and radiotherapy can bed given to the sites (bones) where she is having pain. Hoping for the best.

I also realize that when i push down on my stomach it hurts and somtimes i feel a sharp pain in my chest. Its so weird because when i get my period my cramps are horrible and my vagina gets this stabing pain. (im a virgin so i know its no std ) please help. ovarian cancer runs in my family so im pretty scared.","Doctor":"Hello! Thank you for the query. Lower left abdominal pain can be caused by diverticulitis, urinary tract infection, ovarian cyst. Ovarian cancer can also give such symptom as well as ovarian cyst. Stomach pain seems to be caused by stomach disease like peptic ulcers or acid reflux disease. Sharp pain in the chest can appear due to rib nerves irritation. But most likely your stomach pain and sharp chest pain is caused by stress (as you have admitted to be scared about cancer, this can trigger such symptoms). If an ovarian cancer runs in your family (and maybe breast cancer?) you should consult oncologist as some of such hereditary cancers are caused by genes mutations. You should have checked BRCA1/BRCA2 mutations. Ca-125 level and transvaginal ultrasound should be also performed. Lower abdominal pain should be consulted with gastroenterologist and some blood tests and urine tests should be performed. Hope this will help.

There is really small chance of it at his age. It can be related to kidney damage due to therapy but most often causes of hematuria are urinary infections, kidney stones and urethral and kidney trauma which can be minor.

A fibroadenoma is a benign lesion of the breast and is rarely associated with cancer. You should monitor the lump for a few months and if it is increasing in size, you should get it removed. Sometimes fibroadenomas subside with time. Please consult a breast surgeon for the pain in the breasts. Usually it is due to fibroadenosis which is caused by hormonal imbalance and it responds well to medications. Hope you get well soon.

I suppose i was also wondering with all these problems associated with three generations what measurements can be taken to avoid the 80 year old plight ie food, vitamins etc not thinking of long term medication just lifestyle changes to avoid certain scenarios","Doctor":"Hi and welcome to HCM. This isn easy to answer. I am afraid i didnt understand the question but as I see you are woried about 80year oold woman and possibilityof cancer development in her relative including you. Well, affinity to certain cancers(especially breast, ovarian, uterine and colorectal) is associated with genetic predispositions. There is no doubt about it but it shouldnt concern you and make your life insecure.This is still small possibility,it is impossible to calculate it. All you need to do is to look for sign and symptoms more carefuly then the others and do often examinations and preventive tests especially after 40.year. Your doctor will know about these tests. This patient hasserious symtpoms and cancer in history so it definitely needs to be investigted and treted. All you can do is to live healthy, eat healthy food, avoid alcohol and smoking. You cant change your genetics but can change life habits and think positively. Every human can get cancer no matter about his genetic potential and it is apsurd to be concerned about this possibility because someone in our family has it.

I know it is hard to even thinkabout pregnancy at your age, but first i need to say that possibility is extremly low. Especially considering his infertility. As you said woman can get pregnant even if there wasnt ejaculation inside. You didnt tell me what period of your cycle was? if it was 10-15 days after menstruation then there is a possibility of pregnancy(about 20%,if he is fertile).

Usually lipoma, atheroma, fiibroma or traumatic haematoma, swollen lymoh node. If it is soft and painless it is probably lipoma.

You never know how serious is the bleeding as in the stomach and intestines there is a lot of space for blood accumulation. That is with such symptom, it is strongly advisable to visit ER and have emergency endoscopy performed. His urinary tract infection should be diagnosed with urine culture test to get to know what kind of bacteria does he have and which antibiotics will be most effective. Such long lasting urinary tract infection might also need urologist consult and some additional tests should be performed. Hope this will help.

I want to assure you that prostate cancer is slowly progressive disease . The treatment depends on the stage. You have not mentioned any detail of investigation. Specially serum PSA , Gleason score, and invasion size and lymph node status to be mentioned. In early stage if life expectancy is more ( like more than 10 years or 5 years depending on additional criteria) radical treatment is offered. As they have offered surgery or RT probably your disease is at early stage. Anyway if you do not want surgery then go for radiotherapy.

He had a partial resection and whole brain and beam radiation in 2003. He maintained stability til 2011. He went through chemo for over a year and when that stopped working he was given another full course of radiation. Though there were side effects he had been doing fairly stable since the radiation ended. On Tuesday morning he awoke fairly normally, but after a few hours he was suddenly much worse. He could barely speak, kind of like Charlie Brown s teacher. We felt the right side of his face was slightly slack. His ability to walk or move his right hand was bad also. I thought it might have been a stroke . He refused to go to the Doctor. The question I have has to do with one of his other symptoms. Monday night he complained of pain running from the edge of his left breast under his arm toward the back. Since Tuesday when he has this pain his breathing gets really odd. It isn t really shortness of breath as much as breathing with a continual hitch in it. It is sort of shallow, but it is more like hiccup breathing without the hiccups. Since I can not convince him to go to the Doctor this is kind of an academic question. But can the pain in his side and breathing problem be a sign of a stroke also? And if all of this does point to a stroke, which type would it point ?","Doctor":"Hi, The symptoms match clinically with stroke. Right sided weakness , respiratory problem can be caused by cerebral infarction or hemorrhage. Left sided chest pain mainly radiating to back can be caused by cardiac pathology.

I read that this condition can actually lead to an acute appendicitis if not treated properly. My appendix showed no swelling and my white count was 0. Do I have a reason for concern ? Thank you. Bonnie C.","Doctor":"Hi Bonnie.Thanks for your query.It was wonderful to know that it took 3 months for a diagnosis of Mesenteric Lymphadenitis.This is a condition in which the multiple lymph nodes in the mesentery get enlarged. The commonest cause is always secondary to some infection or cancer. I thin you are less investigated than required as you are still in bed with pain and nausea.I would advise you the following:-Consult a General Surgeon.-Get further investigations to see if there is any other problem related to blood cancer or so. You writing of white count of 0 is not acceptable, this is either your you ignorance or something else you could not note.-You need a Diagnostic Laparoscopy and Biopsy of the lymph nodes for the proper diagnosis.

I also had blood work CBC and a 12 panel something I cant spell done, it all came back good.","Doctor":"Hi, Stomach cancer can not be diagnosed only by clinical history. Vague upper abdominal complaint persisting for long time should not be neglected. There may be a possibility of H-Pylori infection. Anyway, upper G-I endoscopy should be done for having some idea.

According to BI-RADS score the nature of the lump can be predicted in a more definite way. As you have got strong family history, BRCA mutation status to be checked. Breast MRI may be an option also. In case of any suspicion more radical approach must have been taken. Consult your doctors."},{"Patient":"I have prostate cancer . PSA 5.2, Gleason 7. That s all I know about it. My urologist recommends prostatectomy . My radiologist recommends seed brachy. They don t seem to want talk to each other. I have to choose soon, and I am very confused. Any advice, please? Is brachy good with Gleason 7? My urologist has scared me by telling me that if radiation fails, it makes any later surgery much more problematic. Both of them describe their processes as easy. Thank you very much.","Doctor":"Dear Sir, Sorry to hear about your problem. Gleason score represents the grade of the tumor and not the stage (amount it has spread), therefore has no role in deciding the management. If your tumor is operable and your age is less than 70-73, you should go for surgery. If you age is more than 75, then go for brachy as surgery after that age will be associated with complications. Both the treatments have their pro's and con's but both are effective. You should ask both of them to tell you more about the procedures and then make up your mind. Hope you get well soon."},{"Patient":"Hi, im 34 years old male , 6 2 and 210 lbs. i have increased belching and gurgling stomach for about a year and lots of undigested vegetables in my stool (this symptom ive had for years). I was on aciphex for years because of gerd but was switched to dexilant for gastritis . Ive recently stopped taking the dexilant and am trying librax 4x a day and gurgling has decreased considerably. i am very regular with my bowel movements (once a day) so i dont see how it could be ibs . my stools float sometimes then slowly sink most of the time. (the floating stools make me very nervous!) I ve been to my primary and a gastroentologist. these are the tests i have done so far: chest xrays (normal), ekg, cbc, liver and pancreas enzyme blood tests (all normal), upper gi series (showed some thickening of rugal folds), upper endoscopy with biopsy (mild gastritis and gerd, negative on celiac and h pylori), gallbladder ultrasound (normal), ct scan of abdomen and pelvis with contrast (normal), colonoscopy (normal), stool tests for fecal fat (not the 72hr one), parasites and infections (normal) and hida scan with cck (normal). I had lost weight but put it back on in the last 4 months. I do have health anxietys and am currently in therapy and taking vybrid for anxiety. I guess my question could all of this just be a combination of gerd slight ibs and high levels of stress and anxiety. with all of these tests wouldnt they have seen if something serious was causing my symptoms? I worry about pancreatic cancer , but if cancer was causing symptoms wouldnt one of these many test have seen it? Is the ct scan reliable for ruleing out pancreatic cancer I feel like I ve exhaysted all my options and dont know what else to do.Thank you for your time and help","Doctor":"Hi, All of your tests are within normal limit. You can be relaxed. Pancreatic cancer is very rapidly progressing disease, not likely to produce such a long standing symptoms. Anyway, pancreatic protocol CT scan is the imaging to detect pancreas cancer. Otherwise you may have irritable bowel syndrome. Consult your physician nothing suggestive of pancreatic cancer at present."},{"Patient":"Hi I have recently went through chemotherapy and a result I have a low platelet county. The Chemotherapy I wan on has all but ruined my upper teeth and they need to be extracted but with the low platelet count my oral surgeon will not do the operation. My oncologist is suggesting that part of hte problem with my low platelet count may be be due to the bad state of my teeth and I feel like I am in a catch 22. What advice can you give me ?","Doctor":"Hi, You should have mentioned the disease you are suffering from and the chemotherapy protocol in detail. For low platelet count there is definite guideline for management depending on clinical status and quantitative platelet assessment. So you should have also mentioned the exact platelet count. Anyway, chemotherapy induced marrow suppression generally reverses within weeks so in my opinion your tooth extraction will not be problematic.

This month post menstruation I didn t feel good. Should I be worried about uterine cancer and what s the best diagnostic test to find out?","Doctor":"Hi, Mittelschmerz is a benign condition characterized by pain at mid cycle during ovulation.

Almost immediately my voice returned to normal, but he did not suggest for how long I should continue with the piriton. Any guidance would be appreciated.","Doctor":"Hi, Piriton is chlorpheniramine maleate ( antihistaminic) acts as anti allergic.

About 3 weeks ago I began to have a dull but constant pain in my left side, right underneath the rib cage. It started on the same day as my period, so I thought it was related. Everything was normal with my period, but the pain didn t go away when the period ended. By that time, the pain was starting to radiate to my lower left pelvis , right near where my ovary is. I also started to feel the frequent need to urinate. I visited the GP and they did an ultrasound and found a small (4mm) stone in my left kidney. They told me it was a kidney stone that possibly caused a UTI . They gave me antobiotics, but the symptoms just got worse. A few days later, the pain in my lower left abdomen spread to my flank. It was now a stabbing/twisting pain. I went back to the doctor again, and they did a CT scan . Everything came back normal, and my kidneys tested normal as well. They found a small cyst on my ovary, but it proved to be a functioning cyst and cleared up after a couple of days. All of my blood tests and urine tests are normal and show no sign of infection. One doctor said it could be strained abdominal muscles, but it feels deeper than a muscular pain, and it definitely feels internal. Also, I feel like if it was a muscle sprain , I would be able to feel it if I moved/twisted certain muscles, but I don t. In the last few days, I ve started to feel a sharp pressure-like pain in my upper left abdomen, right underneath the rib cage, more toward the front (where the stomach would be). Also, sometimes when I press there, the pain shoots outward to the other pain spots in my body. Also, at times it feels almost like a burning pain. One doctor says it seems to be stress-related, since I ve been under a lot of stress at work. All of my bowel movements are normal, but I have been noticing small white spots in my stool, no mucus, no blood. No diarrhea, no constipation...no more gas than usual, no noticeable indigestion. I have noticed a bit of fatigue, but that could also be stress related. No weight loss, not vomiting, but I do think it may be intestinal. Again, all of the pain is in the left side. Nothing seems abnormal on the right side. All of my doctors think I m crazy but I know something is wrong that nobody has been able to figure out yet!! The CT scans are normal, blood/urine/vaginal swab tests are normal, which is adding to the fact that they think I m crazy!! Please help :)","Doctor":"Hello, Thanks for the query to H.C.M. Forum. Yes , you  right and pain is there , it  is 100 % correct , you are not crazy. Kidney, ureter, urinary bladder ( just behind symphysis pubis) than urethra . All these are  organs of urinary tract system. If there is pain anywhere in this system , you will feel pain virtually all these organs i.e. kidney to urethra. Stone is in the left kidney and when it moves from its site it develops pain all over in the urinary system hence ,you feel pain from back onward to front of abdomen and than lower part and at last behind pubis and in urethra. As the exact position of kidney is on the back side near lumbar spine so this pain refers from onward to lower level. Internal parts of urinary system are very delicate and soft hence any foreign body as stone causes intense pain , even it makes a patient to roll. Now treatment point , drink plenty of water as this will develops diuresis and you will feel less pain . In my patients I m use this treatment and they get relief. Alkalizer solution will give you relief. Few ayurvedic drugs are available for calculus , you can try. Hope I have answered your question.If further any question I will help. Get well soon.

I have gotten much paler in my face & arms. I can see my veins much more clearly in my breasts & arms/fingers. I do have Ulcerative Colitis , but have been in remission for a while. I have paid no attention to these symptoms, & have thought of them to be hormonal as I have started & stopped birth control within the past few months. But today, I noticed two red/purple bruises on my cheek. It appeared out of nowhere & I decided to do some research. I don t know what this could be, I don t want to freak myself out.

First of all you have not mentioned your age and would  also like to know the details of ultasound report about the size of the tumour and other imaging features. you have also not mentioned if the size of the tumour has increased or it's the same over two years. There are some tumour markers(Ca-125,B-HCG,LDH, Alfa-fetoprotein) which can suggest whether your tumour is benign or malignant before planning for removal of the tumour. The list of investigations is long , My advise to see a good gynaecologist in your area who will advise you further tests depending on your age and USG features of your tumour,. Pain ,burning and incontinence could be because of UTI, Get Urine test done and if nesessary get urine culture and sensitivity so that appropriate antibiotic can be started, Unusual gain in weight could be because of hypothyroidism Get your TSH tested.

I have had patients before who, after undergoing abdominal surgery, also developed pain in the same area or nearby. The most common explanation for your pain, if not due to anything else, is adhesions. Adhesions are tough fibrous tissue that develop as a result to the trauma of surgery. You can consider them as scar tissue that form between organs and tissues, causing them to stick together or be pulled from their normal positions. This will, of course, cause some discomfort or pain like in your case.

Your habit of chewing tobacco does put you at a very high risk of oral cancer and it would be advisable to give up your habit as soon as possible. Sometimes it is not possible to reverse the damage already caused by these agents. The white patch you have described, is most likely a leukoplakic patch (which itself is a pre-malignant condition). You should visit an onco-surgeon and have that patch examined. The surgeon might perform a biopsy to confirm the diagnosis. Although it is a good habit to use a mouth wash but it does nothing to reduce the effect of tobacco on your oral mucosa."},{"Patient":"I have throat cancer and am bothered by perfume-like breath.It was a total laryngetomy.

Thank you for the query. CEA level is used to control possible colon cancer regrow or metastases appearance. If the person who has colon cancer history gets increased CEA level, possible metastases should be localized or ruled out. So this should be the reason of concern. Moreover, B2 stage gives high rate of survivals so it is necessary and worth to keep looking. The best way to do that is PET scan which will localize possible metastases.

Most common skin cancer (Carcinoma Basocellulare) is very different than other cancers. It has very high level of survivals, grows really slowly and extremely rare gives metastases. That is why, the only thing which should be done with it is to remove it completely. So even if the pathological result will be cancer, most likely nothing else will be done with it and the treatment will be over. However, if this lesion were  mole-like and they do think it might be Melanoma Malignum, than your son will going to need surrounding tissues removal and local lymph nodes removal.

Long standing tiredness after thyroidectomy may be due to hypothyroidism. The levothyroxine dose you are taking probably is not sufficient. Simply t4 & tsh test will guide you about the dose. Next the pain you feeling at various part of the body particularly the low back pain should be concerned. It may be simple mechanical pain.

In his current state it is not possible to have a major operation (due to the infection and high jaundice). Sometimes a stent is responsible for the infection and that is why the doctor wants to change it to a metallic stent, which is more durable and can help in reducing the jaundice.

The pain lasted for a week or so and then I noticed that my left breast had become bigger than my right one..it protrudes more than the right one..i dont know whether it is a sign of breast cancer .. Wanted your opinion","Doctor":"Dear Ma'am, Sorry to hear about your problem but I am glad that you are seeking medical attention for the same. Breast cancer usually presents as a painful lump in the breast and painful enlargement of the breast is usually not a sign of breast cancer. There might be still be a small chance that this could be something suspicious. To rule that out you should have this problem evaluated by a breast/ general surgeon. Also you need to have an ultrasound of the breast for better evaluation of the lump. Please feel free to ask any other query or share your USG report.

July 5th I had a huge hormone increase, just alittle out of control, I am not sexually active either since the etopic in april. I started having periods twice a month and begged for birth control . at the end of Juy I started low cycle of birth control. I also started noticing itchy scalp and hair loss . I couldnt take the hair loss and scaley scalp so I choped off all my hair. Now near the end of July I went to the ER because I started having lower left quadrant pain. it was worse after a long run 4-5 miles. It went all the way into my thigh so I went to the ER. They did an aultra sound and found cyst on my right ovary , the one that the pregnancy was in. No explanation of this pain in my left quadrant. Since July I have been having a period twice a month. it is now September and finally the twice a month bleeding has stopped, but the pain is back. I went to the ER and they gave me pain meds and some other meds in my IV. I went t the GYNO today and they did an exam on the outside to see were the location of pain was. Then an internal, he said my bladder was shapped funny which I never heard before, this was new. after that he continued the exam and pushed on my abdomin and internal also on the left side, he indicated it was not the left ovary, but did feel something.

These may include pain, change in the general outlook of the patient and spread to other structures. In your case, it would be worthwhile getting a complete evaluation and doing tests to actually see whether the tumor is spreading or not, and a histological examination (biopsy) to ascertain this tumor as malignant (cancerous) or benign.

I am a 48 female from Canada and I am suffering from severe side effects of a topical chemotherapy cream called Aldara. I used it on my entire face for a few small patches of keratosis not knowing that it was a poweful anti-cancer drug that works on your immune system . I used several packages in total, spread out in four seperate treatments and only realized after I became extremely ill that I had over dosed on a dangerous chemotherapy drug. I stopped using it only after exposing myself to high levels of Imiquimod and I now suffer extreme head pain, sore throat, inner ear pain,swollen lymph nodes, insomnia and now eye pain. I was in the ER days after stopping treatment because I thought I was going to die from the severity of my reaction. I was told I had given myself essentially chemotherapy and it would eventually leave my body and I would get better. Well It hasn t and I am not. I cannot find anyone in the small city I am in to treat me, not even the dermatologist who half hazardly prescribed it to me without any instructions or warnings. Are there any specialists in the U,S or even in Toronto( which is closer to me ) that you can suggest that could help me recover from these horrible and painful side effects? I realize my case is very unusual and how many people over dose on Aldara? I am desperate to find help and my family doctor and dermatologist do not have any ideas who to call. Do you have any clinics or specialists I might call or my doctor can call to help me recover from this? I am unable to find the right doctors on my own and I would even see a specialized naturopathic doctor if I thought they could help me. Please help if you can in any way. Sincerely, Tracey","Doctor":"Hi, I would suggest you not to worry to much. I can understand your problem but there is treatment of every adverse effects so you should not worry. Aldara is not a chemotherapy, it is an immunomodulator. It is used to treat low grade superficial cancer like basal cell carcinoma and also other non malignant causes. The side effects are generally local like skin irritation, pruritus, erythema , scab formation. The side effects mentioned by you are extremely uncommon from this ointment. You may consult an internal medicine specialist for baseline investigations."},{"Patient":"I have a smooth, flat red patch on my hard palate .

The cancer was on the left hand side and due to suspicious changes on a MRI the left breast was removed for prophylactic reasons. I had the right lymph nodes removed on the right hand side. This left a large fatty mass under my right arm. This was all in August 2010. In September 2011 I had reconstructive surgery with a right lat dorsal flap and bilateral tissue expander s. I have been in considerable pain ever since. The pain is much worse when I am filled with 50cc every 3weeks. I ve had 5 fills so far with another 3 or 4 to go. The pain has been getting worse and I have discussed the matter with the doctor who says that discomfort is normal, she prescribed OxyContin . I have now been to the emergency department and they have done an ultrasound and have found that there was fat necrosis in the fatty mass under my arm. Apparently there is no treatment for this and I have been prescribed one set of OxyContin and panadeine forte for this. I am very concerned as I don t want to have to take such heavy medication and even more concerning is the fat necrosis. is it possible that the fat necrosis is something else? Is this a common side effect of this treatment. There doesn t appear to be any solution as even if I stop the fills I will have to wait 3months before the doctor will remove the tissue expanders. I had postural problems post mx and reconstruction seemed to be the answer to this. At times the pain is so severe that I feel like demanding that the tissue expanders be removed. Can anyone share any similar experiences or offer any suggestions to help me with my pain?","Doctor":"Hi, Fat necrosis is a common phenomenon after breast surgery. Many time due to neural damage neuropathic pain is also common. If the pain become intolerable some permanent method can be applied by your anaesthesist. Right now, drugs like gabapentin, carbamazepine would be helpful.

Have had a masectomy with no rebuild, and cancer returned on the right side chest wall 3 years after masectomy, so that side was re-radiated (2nd time). That was in 2006. In December, I developed a generalized pain in the right side chest area, but felt it was muscle, as I am a very physically active person. 3 weeks ago, I went to my PCP, as pain was making it difficult to sleep. He wanted to order a CAT scan stat, but since I have had so much radiation , I asked to try a chiropractor first as I felt it was muscle/skeletal. He agreed.

Thank you for the query. As stomach cancer can give no symptoms at all or gives nonspecific symptoms like abdominal pains, weakness, nausea it is very hard to detect it in an early stage. And it is told that about 20% of it can be hereditary. According to this facts it is very hard to tell you if you should be afraid of this cancer or not.

The likelihood of your voice hoarseness being of cancerous origin is likely if you smoke, take lots of alcoholic spirits, have a family history of throat cancer, strain a lot with your voice or do oral sex (some strains of HPV virus which can be contracted from oral sex) can cause throat cancer. Otherwise if you use your voice a lot (at work or somewhere else) especially lately, then you can have voice hoarseness without it being a cancer. Another cause may be the onset of a palsy of the nerve that innervates the voice box. It could also be onset of symptoms of a voice box muscle involvement of a myaesthenia gravis (or some other related muscle weakness disorder) which often worsens with time of the day. Please see a physician for thorough examination and proper work-up in order to determine the cause. Courage and wish you the best, Dr Mbong"},{"Patient":"My son had been diagnosed with Hodgkins Lymphoma over five years ago. He has been cancer free for just over four years now. As of this morning he noticed that he had a tiny swollen gland in his armpit area. We were told not to be to concerned about this they believe it is more likely to be swollen due to an infection, since had just had the flu and a sore throat. I was just wondering what other reasons may there be due to the swollen gland, A concerned Mom","Doctor":"Hi, Your doctor has given you the right advise. This swelling is of infectious origin. Recurrence of lymphoma should not have the yellowish color lymph node. Anyway your son should have undergone proper follow up investigations at regular interval, serum LDH may be helpful. Right now nothing to be worried, you can observe the lump for at least two weeks to look at any change in size.

Called OB and they said due to the stress I was under it was normal sometimes for cycles to get alittle strange. January my period was late but normal cycle. Now this month started spotting (light brown) on the 7th got my period on the 10th and it stopped on the 13th. I had intercourse on the 22nd then started spotting on the 24th and I am still spotting though today. However, It is only when I wipe. And it is bright red.

This morning when going to the bathroom things are feeling better, (no noticeable blood and pain in bladder feels better). Would this be something that needs to be looked into further? Should I be concerned about bladder cancer if I start to feel better? What would cause this onset and then to go away?","Doctor":"Hello! Thank you for the query. Even if there was no bacteria found in your urine sample, it does not mean that there is no infection. That is why, urine culture test is a very good idea. Blood in urine (it does not have to be visible by you) can be also caused by urinary tract stone or glomerulonephritis (kidney inflammation). Urinary bladder cancer is also possible. That is why you should not neglect such symptom. If you feel better, I suggest you to have urine analysis repeated once again and see if the blood is still there. If yes, and no bacteria in culture, you should consult urologist and have cystoscopy performed. If no blood at all and abdominal pain is gone, you may wait and have urine analysis performed from time to time. Hope this will help.

My Dr. then made an appointment with a Gynocologist , which was for today, however, due to a very stormy day, she cancelled. I have to call her office tomorrow to re-schedule an appointment. Last January, I had a lumpectomy performed on my left breast, went through radiation , however opted out of chemo , but I am taking a daily pill - Letrozole -for 5 years. March 1,2013 will be the start of my second year on this pill. Naturally I am concerned, and even more concerned now that the appointment was cancelled, like could it be cancer??? My friend had a similar thickening of the uterin wall quite a few years ago and she was given pills to try to thin it and then had an ablaision(spelling?) procedure done. My mind tends to runneth over. Your input into this will be much appreciated. Thanks.","Doctor":"Hi, Hormonal agents used in breast cancer has a tendency to cause endometrial hyperplasia ( uterus wall thickening). But that is more frequent in tamoxifen not in letrozole.

Can you please check with the official report and confirm if it says \\"lymphoma\\" or \\"lipoma\\". Getting a report on phone can sometimes cause confusion; if in doubt it is better to request for the spelling of the finding, but in every case, best is to get official report signed by the radiologist. Since you mentioned that you were asked to observe with information of 'fatty lump' and no immediate treatment , it is possibly lipoma or some non-cancer tumor (lump). It is good practice to learn to do breast self-examination regularly. Lymphoma needs biopsy confirmation & further treatment.

I had a bilateral mastectomy about 6 weeks ago. I have recently learned that my prolactin level is elevated (161) and after a CT scan I learned that I have swollen lymph nodes in my stomach. What does this mean? Should I be concerned about any of this?","Doctor":"Hi, Infiltrating lobular carcinoma has a chance of spreading both to both the breast, this is the reason why bilateral mastectomy has been done. You have not mentioned your age anyway elevated prolactin level can have other causes. But lymph node enlargement in stomach should be thoroughly examined. There is a chance of lymphatic spread from lower part of breast to this region. A CT guided FNAC may be tried, consult your doctor."},{"Patient":"Hi, i m 46 and have found a lump between my breasts slightly to the left and it has been there for about 3 weeks now. it doesn t seem to move but is sore when i push on it, i m scared that it may be cancer , i haven t had children and my mum has a breast tumer but is is not cancerous so they are leaving it as it is.

Gastritis is due to increased acid output and commonest cause for increased acid output is cigarette smoking, excessive tea, coffee and spicy food. Second common cause of gastritis is infection of stomach by  a bacteria called as H Pylori. I would suggest you to consult a physician who may able to perform upper G I endoscopy on you. You may also need ultra sound abdomen to rule out gall stone as cause of stomach pain. You can continue with previcid and additionally you can take proton pump blocker like pentoprazole.Hope this answers your question ."},{"Patient":"Hi I recently had a breast biopsy for microcalcifications they also put in a clip they rang and said nothing to worry about but booked me into have a MRI ASAP why is that.

Smoking has many adverse effects in our body. It can cause chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, lung cancer heart attack, etc. Throat and oral cancer is more commonly seen with persons chewing tobacco. You should get yourself examined and investigated by an ENT specialist to rule out any cancer. Following investigations can be done :- 1. Throat swab culture. 2. Chest X-Ray PA view. 3. Sputum examination. Smoking can result in breathing problems as it can cause bronchoconstriction- narrowing of the air passage. You should gradually decrease the number of cigarretes smoked per day. Medicines, if needed, can be planned according to your clinical examination and reports of the investigations. I hope this is helpful to yo.

Ascites means that the cancer has spread in the abdominal cavity and the liver is failing. Black stools are probably due to bleeding from upper GI tract (esophageal varices or stomach) what indicates poor liver condition. Right leg edema is probably caused by veins thrombosis.

Long term rare complications of breast trauma is  traumatic fat necrosis which presents as a hard immobile lump in the breast resembling clinically to breast cancer but it is not a cancer.

Thanks in","Doctor":"Hello, I can understand your concerns and anxiety with a family history of cancer. Routine screening procedures are different for specific cancers. For breast, it starts with self examination for lumps and mammography after 35 years. For cervical cancer, you can start getting a Pap smear every year now. For lung cancer, chst x ray is being now evaluated for screening.  There are a few blood tests that can cover for markers of cancer as well. All these procedures are available for low cost. There are a few cancer that can be caused by defects in genes and they are transmitted within the family. A whole body imaging procedure such as a PET scan can be helpful in such situations. From what you have mentioned, it doesnot look like to be the case with your family. Since PET scan is a costly procedure, I would suggest you reserve it for the last and not as a screening procedure. You can get it done once some time in the course and later on follow up with other routine procedures described above. Please go for the simpler tests first. Hope this could be of help.

Laryngopharyngeal reflux is caused by the reflux of acid from stomach to esophagus and upper aero-digestive tract(throat & voice box) due to relaxation of the sphincter at the upper & lower part of esophagus.

Lifestyle modification- like weight reduction, sleeping on the left side, or with upper body raised. 2. Dietary modification- avoid consuming irritating substances such as acidic & rich foods 3. Medical management- Proton pump inhibitors like Omeprazole, Pantoprazole,etc. (which prevent acid formation in stomach) 4. Surgical treatment- includes Fundoplication, done when medical measures fail. So..it will be better to consult a Gastroenterologist & start the treatment.

A burn is a damage of the skin by an aggressive agent which could be fire, hot water, steam, chemicals like acid, electricity, sun etc. Sun produces a characateristic burn which is term first degree burn which affects just the first layer of the skin (epidermis). First degree burn is painful due to presence of free nerve fibres in the epidermis and as such sun burns can be severely painful. Long term exposure to sunlight has been implicated to be a cause of most of the common skin cancers, with sun burn increasing the risk of skin cancers even more. A skin cancer like basal cell carcinoma particularly occurs on bear body parts like the neck, face, hands etc and thus strongly supporting the role of sun light on skin caners. Common skin cancers include squamous cell carcinoma (scc), basal cell carcinoma (bcc) and a malignant melanoma (mm). Each cancer type presents with its own characteristic type; bcc present with translucent or flesh colored scar tissue especially in sun exposed areas, scc presents as a red crusted fast growing lesion and mm as a growing lesion with irregular borders, and variation in colour within the lesion. When skin cancers are diagnosed early enough, complete cure is possible  unlike when t is diagnosed later along its evolution.

I have been doing this for 3 Months.","Doctor":"Hi, the drug which your taking is unlikely to be cause of your sweating. Prostrate cancer is a slowly growing cancer and can be managed effectively with treatment. Since there is no data regarding usage of herbal medicine in the literature nor any clinical trial being done using these drugs, I would not recommend you to take these drugs. Best thing for you would be to consult a oncologist and follow his treatment.

She only weighs about 85 lbs, due to the fact she quit eating solid food months ago, due to the painful swallowing caused by the tumor . Her only nutrution now is in the form of milkshakes my father (who is also dying of colon cancer) makes her once or twice a day. The doctors have referred her to Virginia Mason Hospital in Seartle for all treatment from here on out, which she is refusing to go... How long can I expect my mother to live in such circumstances? Will this be a long, drawn out death or could she just mercifully die in her sleep from starvation? Any information you could give me would be greatly appreciated!","Doctor":"Hi, this dr mukesh, according to your description your mother is most likely having cancer of tongue. Which is locally advanced. But you have not mentioned whether she has any neck swelling. If she doesn't have one then her prognosis is good. She can be treated with surgery and radiation. Having said that even if she has neck swelling, she can be treated with radiation , chemotherapy and surgery. You should convince your mother and take her to the cancer hospital. This disease can be treated and she can be alright. Thank you."},{"Patient":"57 y/o female. Approx. 4 months hx of intermittent nausea, food intolerance , bloating .

Now I have repeated my USG yesterday and have three lumps in right and one in left breasts. Am having pain from the week of ovulation till the menstruation on both breasts. Is this can be turned cancer? Do this need needle incision for further check up? Do I need to change my lifestyle to avoid such things.","Doctor":"Dear Ma'am, Sorry to hear about your complaints but I am glad that you are seeking medical advise for the same. The symptoms you are describing are typical of fibroadenosis, which is associated with pain in the breasts which increases before menses and subsides after the periods, only to recur again after z few days. It is also associated with multiple small lumps/ cysts in the breast. Majority of the times this condition is not associated with any risk of malignancy. You just need to follow up regularly with your surgeon and get regular (yearly) USG's done. For the pain the doctor can start you on Vit E (Evion) capsules and oil of evening primrose capsules. These help in reducing the pain. Other measure you should take are - -reduce caffeine intake -wear a comfortable breast support (like a sports bra) Usually this condition subsides with time as it occurs due to hormonal imbalance.

She said that the wall of my cervix was only slightly thick. So, I had a surgical proceedure in a hospital to open my cervix to be sure it was not cancerous or precancerous.

I don t want a hystorectomy done when they don t know if anything is wrong. what do I do now?","Doctor":"Your story makes no medical sense to me. Whether your cervix is open or closed makes no difference to the ability to do a PAP test, and definitely no difference in the ability to do a colposcopy or biopsy of the cervix.

It is a good indicator whether the lump is benign or malignant. a biopsy will give a definitive answer and you will have to wait for 5-7 days for the result.

Let me tell you that there are multiple treatment options in carcinoid tumors. 1) He can be put on injection octreotide. Studies have shown that octreotide alone can reduce the tumour growth rate. 2) There is a form of treatment that uses radiation that can be targeted specifically to the carcinoid tumors.

Increasing values imply that the treatment is not very effective, where as decreasing values implies the effectiveness, and good prognosis of the patient. It is actually a measure of the morbidity and the mortality of the disease.

Stool tests done thrice turned out to be normal as in no fecal occult blood was seen. Blood test were normal. No anemia. LFT and KFT, whole abdomen USG is normal. Hpylori blood tests are negative. No upper GI endoscopy was done. What are my chances of having stomach cancer?","Doctor":"Hi, non specific upper abdominal complaint should never be neglected. Many a time neglecting such symptoms delay to find out more serious cause. You should have mentioned your bowel habit, any history of nausea vomiting, anorexia also. Chance of cancer is low , still, in my opinion upper G-I endoscopy should be done. consult your physician, take care."},{"Patient":"good morning doc!my father (70 y)was diagnosed with squamous cell carcinoma(throat cancer) six months back.treatment(surgury & radiotherapy )has been done..now just recoverd from side effects..he is also single kidny patient..very weak.. lost 15 kg.weight.he has caught lung infection ..doc conducted some test and found left lung consolidation.he is taking Amoxicilin and potassium 625 mg three times in a day,vizylac,cobadex 2-2 times, calpol ,one anti fungal also to relieve throat pain,,i want to ask wheather he can take vizylac three times to avoid side effects of amoxicilin or not? thankx AAAAA (noida).","Doctor":"Hi, what are the side effects your father is complaining of? there are some definite side effects of radiation which is not related to the drugs like dry mouth, loss of taste sensation. swelling in local region. He has got a lung infection and for this reason he has been prescribed with respiratory antibiotics. probable side effects will be loose stool. for this reason he has been given probiotics like vizylac. Two times a day dosing will be adequate. no need to worry. take care."},{"Patient":"Hi, My name is AAAAA and I am 50 years old. In 2006 I was treated for Anal Squamous Cell Carcinoma . That treatment consisted of Infusion Chemo with 5 Fu, Minomyacin and Cisplatin. I also had 9 weeks of External Beam Radiation. I am 7 years cancer free, which allows me to say that I am cured. Though a major side effect of cisplatin is Peripheral Neuropathy , that never happened to me while I was having treatments or any time soon after treatments. Oddly enough, a year and a half ago, I started having a tingling and burning in a localized area in my right foot. Where the toes meet the metatarsal bones on the foot pad. It started in a small area and slowly began to spread throughout the entire foot pad. It is also now in my left foot, but is worse in the right. The feeling started a a generalized numbness, and is now a combination of burning, tingling,small electric shock feelings in my toes, which only happens sometimes. I finally went to a Neurologist that did an NCR and EMG test. the results came back positive for peripheral Neuropathy. The doctor deemed it idiopathic and offered me drugs to take to alleviate the discomfort. When I asked her what caused this to happen, she said we will never know and the best we can do is manage the symptoms. Well, that certainly did not sit right with me. I have since been on a journey to get to the root cause of this condition. I do not have pain, it is more like a constant chronic irritation, but I do know that this is a progressive condition so I certainly need to take action. My approach is two steps. First I ve researched some alternative treatments and procedures to try to re-establish the current failing health of the peripheral nerves. I just started taking a Neuropathy support formula that contains the more absorbable form of B 12 2000 mcg,B1 300mcg,B6 4mg,B2 4mg, R-ALA 150mg, and vitamin D 500 IU. I am taking this formula 2x a day with an additional 300 mg R-ALA. In addition to this I will be going for treatments using the Rebuilder. This is similar to a tens machine, but uses different frequencies that have been shown to assist in the body s ability to repair. Hopefully, I will get some results with this protocol. The second part of my journey, is the more complicated part. Trying to get to the root cause. I do know that there are hundreds of factors that can contribute to the development of neuropathy. Here are just a few, autoimmune disease, nutritional deficiencies,heavy metal poisoning,hormone imbalances, many metabolic dysfunctions like kidney disease, liver disease, thyroid disease, onset of pre diabetes, digestion issues that can cause chronic long term systemic inflammation, structural dysfunction like spinal nerve compression or stenosis, and peripheral vascular disease. I have already began this journey. I have an appointment with a top Neurologist at the Weil Cornell Medical Center in NYC.He specializes in peripheral neuropathy and has developed a blood test to test to see is the neuropathy is being caused by an auto immune dysfunction. I am also seeing a top spine surgeon at the Hospital for Special Surgery in NYC. I do have several back issues in the lumbar spine. I have had various MRI s done, at would like them read by a top notch specialist. I will also be having some blood work done to rule out many of the other dysfunctions that I mentioned above. I would also like to check for vitamin and mineral deficiencies. All of these office visits and tests are quite costly, but I will not sit back and wait for my condition to deteriorate. It would be nice to be able to do this all under one umbrella. I did think of checking out the Mayo Clinic, but none of them are close to my home. I d like to know what your opinion is regarding my approach to help find the root cause of this condition, and if you have any suggestions for me. thank you for your time.","Doctor":"Hi, peripheral neuropathy is a side effect of cisplatin, but also associated with systemic disease like diabetes, autoimmune disease. Your ESR report should be mentioned. Thyroid profile and blood sugar report also to be mentioned. If you have any sensory or motor deficit then proper level to found out and MRI can be done. Your decision regarding selection of top specialist is perfect. Specialized opinion is definitely needed. In my opinion gabapentin  and SSRI group of drugs should also be added for better benefit in your case. Take care."},{"Patient":"Hi , I have an appointment to have full blood work done with a haematologist, to test for possibly everything, cancers etc. I am also due to visit my OB/GYN for PAP smear etc. What I want to know is it still necessary to visit my obgyn or will the bloodwork be enough to screen for cervical cancer etc. i do not have any problems now, just want to make sure everything is ok. Im 37 yrs old.","Doctor":"Hi, probably you are on routine screening for cervical cancer. let me inform you cervical cancer can not be reflected on complete blood count. you have to visit your gynaecologist for cervical pap smear.

I m also very fatiigued.","Doctor":"Hi, thanks for using healthcare magic Infectious sore throat is usually caused be a virus and resolves with pain medication along with the other modalities that were suggested. If , however, you are seeing a yellow discoloration, it may indicate a bacterial source for the pain which may require treatment with antibiotics. You may want to revisit your doctor for a reassessment. There are non infectious causes of sore throat such as post nasal drip in sinusitis, in some cases of GERD, trauma, lesions within the throat. IF the doctor reviews your throat and thinks that a course of antibiotics is necessary then the symptoms, if due to bacterial infection should resolve provided adequate antibiotics are given and there is no resistance. If you still have pain despite adequate treatment, then it would be necessary to look for other possible causes. I hope this helps"},{"Patient":"My dad has been to the hospital today and has been told that he has leisions on his spleen and possibly kidneys.

Hepatocellular carcinoma with past history of cirrhosis suggests significant decompensated liver with doubtful viral induced rash. Chemotherapy along with significant liver derangement may cause immunosuppression with predisposition to opportunistic infection.

The pain of PHN is more in the elderly people like you, takes far more time than the young adults would take for recovery, control of pain and other symptoms.I would advise such a patient :Neurologist's opinion and further management.Discuss about the trial of other medicines like Gabapentin / Amitryptiline - Tegritol or so, any role of other procedure that can reduce the  pain.

It could mean that you have some heart failure going on, (Lung cancer can cause right heart failure) or that you aren't making protein or that one of the treatments you are taking is causing your kidneys to leak protein. So there are many possibilities, and you need your doctor to sort it out. As far as life expectancy is concerned stage 4 lung cancer life expectancy can vary considerably among different people. Stage 4 lung cancer encompasses several lung cancer types, and includes cancers that have spread to only one distant region or those that have spread extensively. If docs are providing treatment ,then they at least have hope of extending life, quality life, for the person we are talking about it here. I would advise that since that time cannot be precisely measured even in the worst case scenario, that it be lived as if every day were the last, spent enjoying life, friends, family, spent loving and laughing.

Is this lymphoma and this mean that it is becoming more aggressive, also what is expected life expectancy with this type of cancer . Thank you","Doctor":"the swelling appeared overnight may be secondary to the lymphoma your mother had. since it is a large and hard mass it is probably a spread of the lymphoma and is of aggressive type. at this stage its difficult to predict the expectancy because it may vary person to person. but theoritically she may have upto 2 years if she is retreated for the lymphoma. retreatment also depends on her health status.

I recently had minimal spotting, but my doctor ordered an ultrasound . My endometrial stripe is 7.5 mm thick. I am scheduled for a D & C this Wednesday. Should I be scared and worried about uterine cancer? What else could this problem be cause from?

It can occur as a result of polyps (overgrowths of tissue) which may be benign, thickening of the endometrium, excess thinning of the endometrium can also cause pv bleeding. It can also be as a result of endometrial cancer but the exact cause will not be known till all the tests have been completed.

If you are so anxious about getting cancer then visit a gastroentrologist who will do an endoscopic examination and if required will take a biopsy from the esophagus which can be examined microscopically to rule out malignancy.

I am 5 8 at 312 lbs. I dont have an active job and dont exercise. I recently got a mens exam and got some alarming news. My cholesterol is 160. Low hdl and high ldl . My eating habits are horrible to say the least. Everything came back fine on my blood work except the cholesterol and my liver enzimes. My ast was 44 and my alt is 95. I was a super heavy smoker for about 2 years but quit about 3 weeks before my check up. I was told it could be fatty liver but I read it could be cancer. I lose sleep every night and worry myself sick. Im scared its liver cancer. Im scheduled for a liver ultrasound tomorrow. My question is do you think it will be liver cancer and are ultrasounds accurate or could they miss something. Thank you for your time and expertise.","Doctor":"Hi, high cholesterol is not a risk factor for liver cancer. Many liver lesions or body changes could cause an increase in the levels of AST and ALT. A cause is usually sought to know exactly what causes this increase. Its worth while doing tests to for viral hepatitis, especially Hepatitis B and C which normally should be excluded in such cases. The increase in the liver enzyme levels in your case is not that alarming, and confronting these results with other results are required for any appropriate interpretation and adequate concluding clinical judgements could be made. A liver ultrasound shall give an idea about the structure of the liver and any possible nodules, cysts or collections. It orients the clinical to make a suspicion . Definitive diagnosis of liver cancer is usually based only on histologic/biopsy studies. However, specific blood markers could also help. I believe you should be patient for the results of the liver ultrasound. However, main risk factors for liver cancer are excessive intake of alcohol, liver hepatitis viruses (B and C), drugs and some hereditory diseases. Excessive smoking is instead a major risk factor in lung, eosophagal and to a smaller extent, gastric cancer. Meeting a gastroenterologist afer your ultrasound in case you are still very worried is a reasonable option."},{"Patient":"my 9 year old has had 2 mouth ulcers in the last 3 weeks.

However, before the operation is done, a clinical and paraclinical appraisal is usually done , to determine whether the tumour has already attained other structures or not. This usually helps your surgeon to decide on the appropriate treatment option after surgery, and the speed of installation of this treatment. I believe your surgeon must have done this before surgery, and the speed and invasiveness, type of treatment to be taken are usually based on these findings. However, I would advise you to get to take your chemotherapy as soon as possible, for testicular tumours at times spread very fast, and during the spread period, are clinically silent with no signs and symptoms, revealing themselves only in an advanced stage.

First of all, as  he is being treated for diverticulitis, this must mean a diagnosis was made. Let us talk about a granuloma. A granuloma is the body's response to a foreign substance which it could not eliminate, or throw out, thus a collection of immune cells over this substance takes place, resulting in granuloma formation. The foreign substance could be bacteria, fungus, tumor, etc. This doesn't necessarily mean that this is cancer. Although a granuloma can be seen even with malignant tumors, this is not always so. Further investigation of the granuloma will be required to be able to tell what it is for sure. The liver enzymes are usually elevated during the presence of some abnormality. And again, an elaborate work-up would be required to find the cause for this elevation. As your brother is under a doctors supervision, it would be best to conduct all the investigations under his care at this moment, and rule out the worst. I hope I have succeeded in answering your questions, you could write back to us anytime for further clarifications.

On my most recent restaging and evaluation (Sept 2012) the term malignant neoplasm of prostate was included as an alert notice. I did not read this note until just recently. I am wondering if this indicates a change in my diagnosis, or has this terminology been relevant from day one?","Doctor":"Hi, Your prostate cancer risk stratification should be mentioned. You should mention your baseline PSA value before treatment and staging based on pathology report. As your gleason's score was 10 most probably your disease  was high risk prostate cancer. In this case adjuvant radiation may have some role ( pelvic radiation). Anyway it is not clear whether radiotherapy was given or not. Now you have to check your PSA value at regular interval. As radical prostatectomy has been done then PSA value more than 0.2 ng/ml may indicate biochemical failure. then your treatment can be changed. another issue you have to know whether at any time your PSA value came below 0.03 ng/ml or not. This has got prognostic implication. Prostate cancer and malignant neoplasm of prostate are synonymous. take care."},{"Patient":"I have lower left abdominal & back pain , I just began using implanon .

Excision biopsy is the best option in this case. At which portion of neck the lymph node was detected is an important issue, if it is more lateralised then excision biopsy will be a simple procedure and can be done under local anaesthesia.

What can be done? The doctors are telling him that the area is being pinched from scar tissue from a hernia operation after his cancer. This hernia operation was kind of a botched operation and ended up very ill and needed a repair done after the inital hernia operation. They spoke of perhaps putting a tube from his stomach to intestine but are rethinking this as they say it will bend or break(?). Their latest solution was maybe a feeding tube and he does not want to have to resort to that. Any solutions? Thank you.","Doctor":"Hi, management of esophageal cancer depends on location of of the tumor. Generally upper third of esophagus cancer mainly managed by chemoradiotherapy whereas lower and middle third of esophagus cancer managed by surgery followed by chemoradiation if on biopsy report surgical margin are found to be involved. From your question it is unclear whether your brother was offered post-op chemoradiation or not. If post op chemoradiation was given then chance of anastomotic dehiscence is increased. Now in case of your brother as blockage or twist in the tube from his stomach to intestine has occured it is better to think of putting a feeding tube directly to intestine (jejunum) by operative intervention and to put the patient in close follow up. You have to consult your surgical oncologist. Take care of your brother."},{"Patient":"Hello. My name is josh. Im 15 from massachusetts. I have been doing dip. (spitting tobacco) for about 2 months. Maybe 2 times a day and only on school days. Gove or take not doing it for a couple of days. So lets get strait to the point, i have some clear bumps. (maybe 2 or 3.) that are like an eraser tip size that do NOT hurt when u touch them and are not noticeable unless u pull my lip so the skin tightens. Is this cancer? I do not want to talk to my parents about it untill im like 75% sure its cancer..","Doctor":"Hi, 2 months of tobacco use has no strong correlation with development of cancer. long term chewing tobacco use may be associated with leukoplakia which is a premalignant condition. As you have mentioned you have clear bumps in lips, these condition may be due to aphthous ulcer. Anyway you should quit tobacco use as soon as possible otherwise problem may be precipitated in near future.

As per your information she seems to be suffering from malignant  bone tumors. Without proper diagnosis and staging it is difficult to comment on prognosis. Malignant bone tumors may be osteosarcoma, ewing's sarcoma, chondrosarcoma, lymphoma , chordoma. Prognosis and treatment is different in each cases. Anyway, bone tumors can itself cause severe pain due to nearby nerve involvement and bone destruction. there are high chance of response after treatment. At present proper diagnosis of pain to be made. Titration  of analgesic medications to be done and if needed local radiation therapy may be considered. please consult your oncologist. Take care of your friend."},{"Patient":"Is it normal for your fat pad of penis to be darker tone then rest of your body ? Is it possible to have prostate cancer if your fat pad and penis is darker tone then rest of your body tone ? If there s no signs of prostate cancer but u feel like the fat pad of penis is swollen but not are hard, could that be gain of weight ?","Doctor":"Hi, it is normal that your fat pad of penis is darker tone than that of rest of your body. There is no relation of penis fat pad colour with prostate cancer. Your third question is not very clear to me. Prostate cancer is a disease of elderly population, symptoms are often vague, merges with symptoms of benign prostate enlagement. Only way of suspicion of prostate cancer is rising PSA value this issue can be consulted with your urologist. penile pad of fat swelling may be related to some disease but as you have mentioned it is not hard so any fibrotic penile disease are ruled out. Proper clinical examination may be necessary. Take care."},{"Patient":"Does Danazol increase the risk of cancer? I have endometriosis . I was operated in the year 2009 and my right overy was removed.

Side effects include male character development in female like slight increase in growth of body hair, deepening of voice. This drug also increase sensitivity to sunlight exposour so sunlight exposour to be minimised. Regarding cancer risk , slight increase in ovarian cancer has been found by a study previous years.

He has had something similar before - swollen epididymis - but this is worse. Can this in any way be a recurrance? He had Stage 2 before - upper left armpit and one ara of upper left chest only. Should he have an ultrasound? Thank you.","Doctor":"Hi, In hodgkin's lymphoma no role of surgery is there. Probably you wanted to mention surgical biopsy. now, stage II hodgkin's lymphoma is managed by chemoradiotherapy. As already 5  years have been elapsed chance of recurrence is lower but at this stage main concern will be chance of developing second cancer due to previous treatment and late toxicities due to chemotherapy and radiotherapy. If radiation to neck and/or mediastinum ( chest) was given previously, annual chest imaging (high resolution CT scan) is an option to identify any early thoracic cancer. Testicular swelling seems to be unrelated to the disease entity. It may be due to epididymo-orchitis. Ultrasound should be done for proper diagnosis. take care of your son."},{"Patient":"I have smoked cigarettes for nearly 20 years. About a year ago I had Thyroid Surgery , The Dr. did a great job.

Your present problem is repeated blockage of right ear and feeling of presence of fluid in it. This complaint is not related to your malignant disease process.

Hysterectomy may be done for both uterine cancer and cervix cancer ( total hysterectomy with bilateral ovary and tube removal ). The problem you have mentioned probably is a post operative complication. During operation  gut handling may be the cause. As you have not mentioned on what post operative day the problem started detail explanation is a bit difficult but regular electrolyte monitoring preferably at 24 hr interval and conservative management is the best option.

From your question it can be said that she had metastatic disease to start with but what made you think mastectomy and chemo may be a treatment option is not clear to me, anyway CHF and COPD are relative contraindications for a major surgery even these can be tried in special circumstances. As you have mentioned your mom was on regular follow up at a hospital and lots of CTs , Bone scan Xrays Mammo were done, probably her breast cancer screening was done regularly. there are many cancers which are not picked up by screening and with a very short  period present with a metastatic disease. however, this is a depressing fact that your doctors failed to help you so much."},{"Patient":"HELLO DOCTOR THIS IS XXXXXX.

Whole-brain radiotherapy (WBRT) gives symptomatic improvement in more than 50% of these patients. Because brain metastases are a sign of systemic progression, chemotherapy should definitely be given and has better response alng with WBRT,rather  than using WBRT alone.

To improve your symptoms, you should avoid constipations, increase fiber rich products and mineral water intake, avoid fatty foods and soft drinks. Physical activity should be also very helpful.

If the pain comes whenever you miss your meal, it is probably due to hyperacidity. However, to exclude other pathology giving rise to such severe pain , your family physician may advise you for an ultrasound abdomen. I would suggest you to have your meals in time and regularly to avoid such pains. For some time you may be advised to take some proton pump inhibitor and prokinetic drugs to reduce the acid.

Is this anything to worry about, as I have read that cervical cancer causes blood after sex, pap smears and douching. your advice is appreciated","Doctor":"Hello and welcome to HCM Its true that symptoms of cervical cancer are bleeding after having sex. However, blood and mucus on Pap test have different meaning. Actually, what a pathologist looks in a pap test is the change in the morphology (size, shape and various characteristics of cells lining the cervix) of the cervical cells. On the basis of these features the cells are labelled as normal, dysplastic, pre-cancerous or cancerous. Presence of only blood and mucus is an unsatisfactory smear/ test. You will have to get the test repeated. Blood in the test is due to procedure and mucus is normally present in the cervical canal. The material which was required has not been sampled.

Basically if the scan shows anything, even if it's not growing they will give her chemo, they said low dose. I want to know what the chances of her losing her hair are? I know that will be the least of our worries if she has to have chemo, but i want to be prepared for this if it is likely to happen.","Doctor":"hello, one of the side effects of chemotherapy is hairfall and vomiting. You can avoid it using hair caps which are spcialised to reduce hairfall during chemo. You can ask your doctor about it. Even if she has hairfall it will be temporary and it wil subside soon and her hair wil grow back. I hope i have answered your query. Take care"},{"Patient":"I was just given a CT scan for abdominal pain of my left side (even with my belly button). Also had a blood test (normal, no oddities). The Doctor thought I might have diverticulitis . All the organs looked good from all cross sections. Then he said they found a few bump-like things near the lymph nodes in that area. He wasn t saying anything about cancer, but has me scheduled to see a hematologist/ oncologist later today for additional testing. I don t have any fever, nausea, vomitting, blood in stool or urine, swelling, etc. I just have this recurring pain. Sometimes it s worse than other times, but I can still do my daily activities (work, ride a bike, etc.). Needless to say I m scared at the thought of seeing the oncologist. Any idea as to what this could be?","Doctor":"Hello! Thank you for the query. Left abdominal pain can be caused by diverticulitis (most common), urinary tract infections, ovarian cyst, inguinal hernia, large intestine polyps and colorectal cancer. If this was CT without oral contrast and intestines clearing, diverticles might not be visible. That is why you should have colonoscopy performed. This will rule out all large intestines diseases. If you find your pain more in the groin than abdomen, hernia is possible. A surgeon should examine you to rule it out. Enlarged lymph nodes can be due to many reasons and the most common is infection or inflammation. It does not have to be a cancer. To make sure, lymph nodes can be taken for tests. Hope this will help.

Currenty I have a new one on my left breast that has been resistant to all differnet types of creams and lotions. I also notice that during my period they seem to be even more dry and itchy.

When I squeeze them they are very painful but nothing comes out except blood . One will go away but shortly after I find another. At the present time, I have 2 under my left arm and 1 under my right arm. Could this be cancer?","Doctor":"hi abhart, no this is not a cancer, these are simple boils due to pulling of hairs. you can use ibupfren plus paracetamol or diclofenac plus paracetamol combination for pain . Also do not try to squeeze them. If pus present use antibiotics for it."},{"Patient":"Hi. I have a whole series of symptoms that have arisen over the past few weeks. Abdominal pain . Bloating . Occasional shortness of breath. Constipation. Uterine bleeding. And in the last week, a rather large lump underneath my left ribcage. I ve had a pelvic ultrasound. No ovarian cancer . Still waiting on uterine cancer biopsy. And my white blood cell count is elevated. No one knows what it is.","Doctor":"hi there, depending on your age abdominal pain with bloating and bleeding cyclically can signify normal menstural cycle with dysmenhorea.If you are post menopausal then you may need to worry and get a pelvic ultrasound along with PAP smear exam and a physical exam done by a gynecologist.Certain tumor markers like CA-19,CEA can also be done. Elevated white cell count signifies an infective state and so you will need to get a differential count and a peripheral smear study done. An abdominal ultrasound could be done to know the origin of the lump that you felt beneath your ribcage and whether it is significant in your present history. The best thing to do would be to consult a genenral physician and get any investigations done according to his advise. Take care."},{"Patient":"My husband 51 years old- says he has a nodule in his left testicle . He also has pain-he thinks it might be a hernia . His father had something cancerous in his groin area about 15 years ago. He received radiation therapy & beat it, however he since has died, not from the cancer but a stroke victim. I made an appt for my husband, do you think because his father had something similiar, my husband could have inherited this also?","Doctor":"Hello, There can be various causes for a nodule or lump in testis including cancer. Testicular cancer is the most common form of cancer in young men, mostly between the ages of 15 and 44. Since 1975, the incidence of testicular cancer has more than doubled. Family history of testicular cancer has long been recognized as a significant risk factor. It is still the strongest known risk factor for testicular germ cell tumors. Genetic effects have been estimated to account for about 25% of susceptibility to testicular cancer,putting it in third place with regard to heritability among all cancers. Having a brother with a testicular germ cell tumor increases a man´s risk 10 to 13-fold. This is higher than for any other cancer. Having a father with testicular cancer increases the risk 4-fold. I would advise you to consult a surgeon and get the relevant investigations like CT scan and testicular biopsy done to arrive at the diagnosis. Thanks"},{"Patient":"My 84 year old mother has recently ( last 4 days) been experiencing sharp pain in the left side of her abdomen , at about the same hight as her belly button. The pain is so severe that she yells out in pain. It goes away in a few seconds and she feels OK, however it keeps coming back. She has had a bowel movement the previous day, although constipation is a problem. Any suggestions what I can do to relieve the pain, should I be taking her to a Doctor. She also has Parkinsons, thus movement is limited. Thanks for your advice.","Doctor":"Hi ! Yes, if she gets the pain regularly and the severity increases, then you have to show her to a doctor to exclude any surgical problem like diverticulitis (common in persons with constipation) and a ureteric colic for which he may advise her to undergo an ultrasound abdomen, and a colonoscopy if need be. If all these are negative, then this pain could be a central pain arising from brain, an infrequent symptom of parkinsonism. In that case, your family physician may give her only symptomatic treatment.I wish your mother to recover from her pains soon."},{"Patient":"my father has under gone thyroid surgery , he consumes eltroxine 150mg dailly, and shelcal ct tablets, now has got cancer , he hadn t smoke nor drunk in his life time, but had got cancer, why is there no chance for him to speak, pls doctors make research regarding thyroid gland replacement operation just like kidney transplantation","Doctor":"Hi Thanks for writing in. I am sorry to know about your father. Did he have thyroid cancer when he was operated? Does that mean that it has come back? Where all it has spread? Even if it has come back, we have options of resurgery and/or radioiodine therapy. I am not sure why he can't speak. It may be due to injury to the nerves during surgery or cancer infiltrating voice-box or removal of voice-box due to cancer infiltration. Regarding your specific query about thyroid gland transplant, it is very unlikely that it would ever be done as after thyroid removal just thyroxine hormone replecement is enough for lifetime. There is no need to do such a complicated procedure like organ transplant. Removal of thyroid itself cannot lead to loss of voice as I mentioned. If you can send more details, we can guide you better."},{"Patient":"Hello. am 23 years old.I was been said that fibrocystic disease.I have pain in both breast. I want to know that if fibrocystic disease have any relation to breast cancer?and what is fibrocystic disease.I have done x-ray , mammogram , ultra sound scan.in ultra sound scan reported that both mammary glands show mild fibroadenotic changes of parenchyma","Doctor":"Hi, Welcome to HCM, You are having Fibrocystic disease og breast, in which lumps are present and they can be painful or tender this discomfort may change with changes in hormone level during periods. These are non cancerous in nature so please do not worry. You have already done mammography and sonography, and  they also support your diagnosis. You should be examined by a Surgeon who can palpate typical cobble stone type in upper and outer quadrant. If there are any suspicious lump then only a fine needle biopsy or nipple fluid aspitration is done to rule out malignant lesion. Risk of cancer is there but very small fraction, only thing sometime it may be difficult to diagnose in presence of fibrocystic disease. For pain local or systemic analgesic may be used and treatment option are few but may be dopamine agonist and progestins. Take care Good luck"},{"Patient":"Hello, I have had a sinus infection for about 3 weeks now. I went to see my doctor, complaining of pain on the right side of my head, behind my eye. It also was very painful to look from left to right with my right eye. He said I had a lot of fluid in my ears as well, and gave me a 10 day supply of Augmentin . I finished the antibiotic about 2 days ago, and now I am experiencing the same pain on the left side of my head. I do have a lot of drainage, and some stuffiness. Both of my eyes hurt when I move them from side to side. I also have a sharp pain down my neck into the left shoulder . I am concerned because my father died of brain cancer at the age of 49. His father also developed skin cancer that went into his brain, but much later in life. I just wonder if the headaches are caused by other reasons. Oh...I am a 36 year old female. Thank you, Natasha","Doctor":"hello natasha, i think yiur headache is due to your ear infection or sinus infection but you should confirm it by scan. you can use medicine cefpodoxime 200 mg twice daily for 7- 10 days ,very good for sinus and ear infection for pain you can use nimuslide plus paracetamol combination twice daily."},{"Patient":"i noticed a small pink lump to the side of my anus 3 days ago which has gotten bigger and last night the pain was unbearable, it was also having some effect with me going to the toilet which i mean i wasnt sure if i needed to go, i have woken up this morning to fell next to no pain but blood in my boxers and the lump has gone smaller i am very worried is this cancer?","Doctor":"Hi thanks for your question. The lump next to your anus most probably could be a pile mass. The pain could be due to inflammation of the pile mass. Defecation aggrevates the pain. Spontanous regression of inflammation is possible due to which your pain has decreased,but for blood in your testis you need examination by a physician as it could be a seperate issue.It could be a haematoma( blood under skin or muslcle) I would suggest you to get yourself examined by a physician to rule out testicular haematoma,which if present needs investigation and drainage.

Two months ago it bleed and now it s as if the inside of the mole is hanging out. I have seen a consultant dermatologist and I am having it removed next week. Can you explain the procedure and should I be concerned about cancer . Also will it be painful after its been removed?","Doctor":"Hi thanks for your question. This mole is malignant (cancerious)or not can only be determined by histopathology,once it is removed. The procedure for its removal depends upon its size,if mole is of small siz it can be removed  under local anaesthesia.. However if mole is of large size it has to be removed under general anaesthesia. You will have mild pain after its removal which can be easily taken care by pain killer.

I am tired alot and wonder if I have to be concerend with breast or lung cancer ?","Doctor":"hi there, the lump that you feel could be a lymph node or could be asccessory mammary gland tissue. You should visit your physician and get a fine needle aspiration cytology done of the lump. This test is very simple and it will be able to tell your physician the exact nature of the lump and whether you need to worry about it or not. Your tiredness could be due to lack of proper sleep or worrying about this lump.

Often chemo and radiation can make the tumor considerably smaller in esophageal cancer. And he might be able to eat better later. Avoid milk products as they can cause lots of slime. About the nausea - you could try bands that go around the wrists and have buttons that press an acupuncture point on the wrist (p6)- often used in pregnancy or for car sickness. You would have to ask for them in the chemists or drugstore. You can also try buying ginger lolly pops - or ginger tea or even ginger ale. You can also make your own ginger lollipops. Also ask your doctor for some high calorie astronaut food. Careful they might bring on slime - see if they have some things unlike milk. Hope this helps a little. You might also ask your clinics if they have a nutrient counselor. kind regards, JR"},{"Patient":"My Fiance is a 53 year old male with COPD/Emphasema, in the past two months he was diagnosed with H-pylori ,he had 2 months of chronic diarrhea .This was cleared up.

I have been facing tremendous hair loss problem for about 6 months now. Its not a hereditary problem in our family still cant figure out the reason for such excess hair loss. I went to a dermatologist [D.N.B (Skin & V.D.), D.V.&D.]. He did nt say much but just said its due to hormones and gave me the following prescription. 1.Pilovit Forte (Nutrional Food Suppliments) 1 at night (30 days) 2.

Hair loss can be pretty much individualized and it is not necessary to have a family history of baldness to lose hair permanently! If you have distinct areas of baldness then these are just temporary medications and hair loss would continue to occur. It would be prudent to make an appointment with a plastic surgeon who practices hair restoration because definite areas of baldness can only be completely remedied with this surgery."},{"Patient":"I have had diarrhea now for 8 weeks.

I finished the antibiotics yesterday and am waiting for my diarrhea to settle down again. I have had a colonoscopy , my colon is totally normal and there is nothing to worry about. I am a type two diabetic and have been for 4 years now. Can you shed any light on this and tell me if taking antibiotics would stop my codeine from being as effective?","Doctor":"Since you had antibiotics for 10 days your bacterial flora in the   intestine may be affected which helps in the re absorption of  water from the stools. So what you can try is stop codeine  and take some probiotics available in your home or you can get it from your family doctor. Since you dont have fever or abdominal pain or vomiting this is usually non infective diarrhoea induced by the antibiotics. Hence,  whenever you take antibiotics for any reason next time take some probiotics containing lactobacillus spores alongwith the antibiotics."},{"Patient":"Hi, My name is Ali I want to ask you some thing about my mother detail is given below Colostomy done 3 months ago due to abstraction after CT scan and colon scope found adenocarcinoma in rectum and CEA report was 82 the portion containing adenocarcinoma has been removed with open surgery After Surgery CEA report is 4.45 Normal MRI both plain and contrast also showing normal from lever to pelvis no evidence found mean to say all is clear No I want to ask you that which type of therapy is necessary for my mother is Radiation and chemo is necessary or not","Doctor":"Hello! Thank you for the query. Chemotherapy or radiotherapy is advisable depending of the clinical stage of the cancer. Only in stage I and II (not every case) chemotherapy is not necessary. All others stages needs chemotherapy. You need to know that chemotherapy is used for eliminating all micrometastasis. Even one cancer cell left can cause further spreading of the cancer.

Generally, there is not much difference between PSA 2,02 and 4,67 as the conditions could be different between this two test. And still your result is not very high. It is only slightly elevated.

If you do suffer from constipations for years, have had blood or mucus in stool and lost some weight recently, you should have colonoscopy performed. Your hemorrhoids might need some surgery which can also set you free from stenosis. Your throat and tongue pains connected with abdominal pain can be due to acid reflux disease and throat inflammation due to acid irritation.

First of all, at your age, the possibility of you having prostrate cancer is less than 0.00001%. Just say it is old people's illness more than 40 years. If you are urinating and drinking frequently it is possible that you either have an infection or a metabolic/electrolyte disorder. So it will be useful to conduct a urine analysis and blood electrolytes. Since you said, your blood sugar level was tested and it was normal reason for conclusion you do not have diabetes. I will suggest that a fasting blood sugar be run at two different instance of more than 6 hours difference. If there are abnormalities in your urine analysis and electrolytes it can be treated accordingly by your doctor. There is another possibility of your frequent urination being due to the two much humidity or increased thirst or even two much dryness. When you feel too thirsty, you drink too much water and subsequently urinate frequently. You might be having an abnormal physiologic disturbance which if allowed with time and change in environment, you will gradually stop urinating too much. In any case which you a quick recovery and hope you meet a doctor soon enough to run some test. As for your masturbation problems, i think you need a lot of counselling from a sexual disorder specialist. It will require a lot of discipline from your part to stop masturbating and you need to be treated from your chronic masturbation addiction. Hope this helps"},{"Patient":"it seems to me that flow of food in my food pipe is not proper,I underwent endoscopy twice from different doctors but they said that there is nothing serious, but i m getting lazy day by day, feeling weak too from last 2-3 years. i have fear in my mind of cancer in my food pipe so want to know that what test is required to clear this. one thing is more my wastage is not proper it is like toothpaste.","Doctor":"hi there, if you have this problem kindly visit a gastroentrologist and get a thorough exam done besides an endoscopy, also other investigations are done to rule out any pressure on the food pipe from out side or any defect in your peristaltic movements called dysphagia lusoria, only after you have ruled out all other cause of difficulty inswallowing and there no organic cause then you can visit a psychoanalyst and get councelled about the same. As you are not consuming food properly that could be the cause of your poor stool formation., do not worry about something so much which may not even be there like cancer and concentrate on being healthy.

Its bright red and my stools are very hard and constipated. I can feel 2 little grape like things on outside of anus .is this hemorrhoids or cancer polyps? You can see blood on toilet paper in the toilet and running down side of stool. I m on a lot of narcotics because of injuries from bull riding,so I know that s why I m constipated. I m afraid of cancer but can live with hemorrhoids.What do you think it is?","Doctor":"hi there,the description suggests that you are suffering from 3rd degree haemarrhoids and the bleeding in from that. The constipation is making matters worse and you may also be having concurrent fissures. But it would still be wise to visit a surgeon and get a colonoscopy done to rule out anal polyp and cancer as you fear. You could take some stool softeners and laxatives to relieve you of the symptoms at present and include lots of fiberous food in your diet. Avoid refined and stored food products and take plenty of fluids. Discuss with your physician about the continued use of narcotics and if they can be avoided.. Get your hemoglobin levels done and if you are anemic start on iron suppliments and you have to compensate for the loss of blood in stools.

In early stages, usually we ask for upfront surgery then chemotherapy. In locally advance cases, chemotherapy 4 cycles followed by surgery then 4 cycles of chemo of different type can be advised. In locally advanced cases, patient must undergo USG abdomen, bone scan and at least X ray chest. ER PR will decide future hormonal treatment. Keep me posted.

Do you have abdominal distension/ loss of appetite/ fever along with mentioned symptoms? Blood in stools is an alarming sign and it should be taken seriously. Although you have negative history of any type of cancer but still your symptoms suggest for thorough work up. You should consult with internal medicine specialist/ gastroenterologist. You should go for colonoscopy along with complete blood count, thyroid profile. You should also go for CT scan abdomen with angiography, if colonoscopy is normal.

I have been a diabetic since my chemotherapy .","Doctor":"Hello, Welcome to HCM, I am Dr. Das Fatty liver is the most common incidental finding during ultrasound scan of abdomen. It is a very benign condition. It is unrelated with your previous history of carcinoma ovary. For this, you have to do a liver function test. If all are within normal limit, then you need nothing. But, in case of abnormality in the liver function test, you should consult with a gastroenterologist. You should avoid alcohol and fatty foods."},{"Patient":"I have had swollen lymph nodes right below my chin on both sides. I went to the ent doctor. they put me on an antibiotic for two weeks and they did not change. I have always had enlarged tonsils so we discussed taking them out. he did not feel the lymph nodes were from a cancer type but he did check down my throat to be sure as I was a smoker for 20+ years. I had the tonsils removed 3 weeks ago and the lymph nodes are still swollen and hard...not changing at all and he said they would change by the first of the year.","Doctor":"Dear Dcschlichting, Swollen lymph nodes under your chin does not necessarily mean that you have cancer. It could be because of your poor orodental hygiene. If your tonsils were removed, have they been subjected for histopathological examination. Calcified lymph nodes will not get any change inspite of taking variety of anti biotics. in case your physician is suspicious about thease nodes you should get fine needle aspiration from the lymph nodes done. Even direct biopsy of the suspicious pathological node is recomonded as there are so many causes of lymph node enlargement and the main cause can be ruled out. Consult your primary physician about it.

Its easier to know sometimes than to be kept in the dark","Doctor":"Hello Theresa Thank you for getting in touch with us. As I see, your husband has a past history of CVID. Common Variable Immune Deficiency is a disorder characterized by low levels of immunoglobins (antibodies). The result of these defects is that the patient doesn't produce sufficient antibodies in response to exposure to pathogens. As a result, the patient's immune system fails to protect them against common bacterial and viral infections. The net result is that the patient is susceptible to illness. It is not as deadly as severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID). Serum Bilirubin, SGPT, SGOT tests are used to check the function of liver. These are not markers for cancer. As his platelet count is still high, he can fight infections on his own and the spleen is working properly.

The ideal thing would be to redo another CT scan, to better evaluate the integrity of the stomach. the stomach is however not one of the usual destinations of spread of ovarian cancer.

You have to wait for your FNAC(fine needle biopsy)  report and also the way the nodule looked on ultrasound. Only on MRI it cannot be commented that it is cancer.

The lump in your armpit however needs evaluation. As you are saying it is soft to hard to touch and painless you will need to get a FNAC done of the same and find out the nature of the lump. Accordingly it can either be excised or other mode of therapy can be given. Do get evaluated for peptic ulcers or gastritis from your GP and try a course of antacid as sometimes worrying too much about some thing can lead to stress ulcers and hence the pain.

There are five stages of colon cancer (0-4). Stage 4 colon cancer is the most advanced cancer stage. In general, stage 4 colon cancer has spread to nearby lymph nodes and other parts of the body. Common destinations include the liver and the lungs.This is called as metastasis. Since bile duct is blocked it means cancer has spread to liver also.

It s important to know do you vomit blood, coughing up blood or you just noticed it in your saliva. The first one means that you have some serious gastritis,gastric ulcer or esophageal disease. Coughing up blood is also a serious symptom which could be sign of pneumonia, COPD or even cancer so this needs to be ruled out. Blood in the saliva could be seen due to some lesion (ulcer, tumor, gingivitis, teeth disorders) of mouth or pharyngeal mucosa.

I get hot flashes and what feels like an adrenalin rush. when i fall asleep my dreams are usually crazy weird and when i wake up my heart starts racing and feel like i might pass out. this last part usually last about 5 to 10 minutes then sort of subsides. these symptoms will get worse and worse then i will get my doctor to give me prednisone to get things under control. the reason why i try to link this with my flare ups is i usually have diarrhea and cramping at this point. my doctors can t seem to give me any answers as to what these symptoms are caused by. the only thing that makes these symptoms go away is taking prednisone. Please point me in the right direction or maybe what this could possibly be.","Doctor":"Hi.Thanks for your query.Prednisolone is a steroid and if it is helping you the diagnosis of ulcerative colitis is done , confirmed .

Hormonal status of yours is not completely suppressed by tamoxien and persisting estrogen activity does cause the discharge from the vagina. In the long run second malignancy from uterous is expected after long therapy of tamoxifen.

I also have a family member that has survived Lymphoma and its worrying me can you tell me what I need to do. Oh and another thing I do not have health insurance at the moment. HELP!","Doctor":"Hello and welcome to HCM The neck region (near the collar bone) has a large number of lymph nodes. Any swelling in this region can be a lymph node enlargements. Malignancy of lymph node ie lymphoma is not usually painful but involvement of nerve can cause pain. Since you have afamily history of lymphoma, it has to be ruled out by some investigations. A FNAC (Fine needle aspiration cytology) needs to be done. In this procedure cells are sampled with a needle and are seen under the microscope. If malignant cells are present firther excision is done and histopathological examination is done. Histopathological examination characterises the type of lesion. Since you have a history of melanoma in the past, melanoma can reccur as it is an aggresive tumor and can metastasize to lymph node. FNAC will give information about the type of cells in the lymph node. The pain associated with the enlargged lymph nodes indicates some kind of inflammation. Infection in the head and neck region often cause enlargement and pain in the local lymph nodes in the region. Consult your doctor for investigation. Next step/ investigation will be decided subsequently. Thanks and take care Dr Shailja P Wahal"},{"Patient":"Today in the morning, I was woken up by sharp, abdominal pain . Thinking it was just number two, I sat on the toilet. Suddenly I started having cold sweats, dizziness , and more intense abdominal pain. The pain was so intense I took a pain killer. Later my urge of number two came back which resulted in diarrhea . Exhausted, i fell asleep for a few hours. The last time I had this episode was two months ago when i had my period. For today, my period has just started. In total, I ve only had these symptoms happen twice. Is there a correlation between my period and these symptoms?

My age is 26. 1. When I was 2 years old I got polio and still now i am carrying this. I can not walk. I use wheel chair. My full lower portion and left hand is affected by polio. Right hand is okay. for this polio my hips joint is also displaced. My both legs and left hand are thin. But I am used to with this problem and so far managed my life. 2. For last 5/6 years I have huge back pain. I thought as I can not stand out and walk may be for this reason i have this pain but when I x-ray my back then Doctor told me that I got Scoliosis . My upper spine is cured 30 degree and lower portion is curved 35 degree, so I have ahuge back pain. For this back pain I used a brace for 2 years but it was very uncomfortable and sometime it cause breathing problem, so leave it. But still living with this huge back pain and continuing my regular activity. 2. My another problem is Lipoma , Benign tumor . Now I am very much tensed for this. Though I got that first lipoma about 7/8 years ago in my left thigh and few grew up after that in my back but I wasn t concerned for these. But no a day these are growing in my both leg, thigh, hands, most of them are still small but 4/5 are big. I dont have any pain yet but very much tensed for this growing. I heard that there is a fewer chance to turn this lipoma as lipocircoma. I haven t take any medicine for this yet. But for reducing fat I am drinking Aloe Vera Juice 2 times a day and Apple Cider Vinegar once a day. More over frequently I have Headache. My eating habit is as usual.

I am waiting for the answers. Thank you. Jahid.","Doctor":"Hi Jahid, two things, lipomas in the tummy are prone for cancerous growth. Secondly there is nothing which can prevent them turning malignant. But if your sonogram of tummy shows lipoma, you need to do 3 monthly sonogram to watch on it.

Staging a cancer means determining the extent of the cancer in the body.A cancer is staged based on the size of the tumor, any spread to lymph nodes, any distant spread. Based on these factors, your dad's doctor will be able to give you the survival rate. In terms of spending time together, you could talk to him. He may not be able to reply verbally depending on the extent of any surgery and the tumor , but he may be able to type or write a response. Spend some time thinking of questions that you would like to ask him, write them down and ask. Ask about anything related to the present or to your future, what does he want for you? Think of questions you would want to ask in 5 or 10 year, if you can. If possible record the answers so that you can review them later,. You go for walks, he may be in a wheel chair or still ambulatory, either way it is an opportunity for you to spend some time together.

Given the history, it is likely that the tumor in the stomach is a lymphoma/MALToma. Since there are 2 coexisting tumors, the prognosis definitely is poor. As far as the Myeloma is concerned, the prognosis can be ascertained by several lab parameters like chromosomal abnormalities, beta 2 microglobulin levels, increased calcium levels etc  but also by other issues like age, her medical condition and the grade of her myeloma. On an average, survival for myeloma patients will vary from 11 months to 3 years.

A colorless discharge is always of benign condition. The pain is also in the favor of benign condition. The indentation may occur in a condition like fat necrosis. The best way to rule out any abnormality , is to do a scraping smear from the secretion, and its microscopical examination. It will reveal any abnormality.

I have experienced slight bleeding after sexual intercourse with my partner over the last few months, and have been told by a GP that being on the Pill increases your chances of cervical erosion. I have been on the Pill for 4 years now. Please help.","Doctor":"Hello ella.schalch, Taking the Oral Contraceptive Pill increases the chances of cervical erosion, simply because the inner lining of the cervic everts out under the effect of estrogen in the Pill. Stopping the Pill may stop this erosion. Since this lining is thinner than the lining of the vagina there may be some spotting after sex. Most of the times, however, there may be no symptoms. Having said this, may i add these comments: 1) If there is any discharge - yellow or curdy white or itchy or foul/fleshy smell, you will need local and oral anti-infection medicines. Please check out with your doctor for this. The vaginal inserts may be available over the counter from the local pharmacy. 2) Since you have bleeding after intercourse, please do get your latest Pap Smear done even if you have had one done within last 1 year. This is to screen for cervical cancers. If you could get HPV testing also, it will relieve you greatly if the reports are negative. 3) Even if you are on the Pill for prevention of unwanted pregnancy, it may be wise to use a condom in addition for prevention of sexually transmitted infections (STIs). Please don't be so alarmed - cervical erosions reverse, they can be treated with anti-infectives and ablative treatments like cryotherapy, they don't always indicate cancer and are often more often benign/noncancer.

Reason is that you dont expect a cancerous growth which was there in 2009 to disappear with antibiotics and reappear after 3 years.

About a year ago, I was diagnosed with papillary thyroid cancer and had a total thyroidectomy . A recent ultrasound showed a possible reoccurrence in a couple of lymph nodes. So, for the past 2 weeks, I have been on a low iodine diet, preparing for a PET Scan and RAI uptake scan. During this time (mostly while sitting upright), I noticed a painless throbbing/pulsating sensation in my mid/left back. It grew worse after taking thyrogen shots, and even worse after taking the radioactive iodine pill for the RAI Scan. The pulsating grew very rapid while I was lying on the RAI imaging machine. (HEALTH QUESTION #1): What could this pulsating sensation possibly be, and should I be concerned? I also have Grave s Eye Disease, and have been having some eyelid swelling for about 3-4 months. Both of my top eyelids have a significant lump in them. (HEALTH QUESTION #2): Is this normal for Grave s Eye Disease? Can they be cancerous? Can they be removed?","Doctor":"Hi Tinikie' Question -1 --> I really am not sure what is the cause of this throbbing or pulsating sensation. Is it only a sensation or is there a pulsatile swelling? Is it visible and related to any bone?. Our present concern is whether there is any  distant spread from the tumor. This question will get answered once the results of the investigation comes out. If there is no evidence of any disease spread (in other words report of RAI and PET are negative) and if it is only a sensation, then I dont think there is any cause for worry. But if you ask me why what is the reason, I dont know. But if there is a recurrence either in lymph nodes or else where you definitely would require treatment. But dont worry, pappillary carcinoma thyroid has a very good prognosis or outlook. Q-2 --> It is probably due to Graves d/s. Definitely it is not cancerous and you dont need to remove it.

I had chemo and radiotherapy but a lump was felt just above the site of the earlier cancer at a recent check up and was sent for an ultrasound where they took a tissue needle biopsy. I expected some bruising but haven t any. My concern is that cancerous lumps don t usually bleed and if it was scar tissue, which is the other option it probably would have bled??","Doctor":"Hi Michele Jacobi The first thing that has to be done once you find a lump in the region of the chest wall is to confirm what it is. In your case a biopsy has already been done and let us await its result. Your understanding that cancerous lumps dont bleed after biopsy is correct. But I think your presumption that if it was scar  tissue it would have bled is not correct. Scar tissue also need not bleed. Needle biopsies does not usually cause any bleeding unless a blood vessel is ruptured during the procedure Since how long have you noticed this lump. Is the size of the lump increasing ? If the biopsy comes as positive for cancer then you will have to undergo a series of investigation to find out he the extent of the disease. ? Whether it is confined to the chest wall only or whether it has gone beyond the chest wall to other regions. Treatment decision will depend on the results of this If the biopsy comes as negative for cancer then there are 2 options 1- If your physician thinks it is insignificant then you need to follow it up. Just keep a check on your lump to see whether it is increasing in size and also get it checked by your physician regularly 2- The second option (and my preference) is to do an open biopsy especially if the lump was detected recently and is increasing in size and also if the lump is firm to hard ( and not very soft). The reason is needle biopsy can be negative but this does not always mean there is no cancer especially if the tissue sample taken is not adequate. Also time factor is important. You may loose time keeping the lump under follow up to see whether it is increasing in size Hope you are satisified with my reply. Anyway dont worry.

All other symptoms that you have mentioned is not associated with cancer of cervix. As you have an abnormal cell in the cervix and also as you are HPV positive you need to have a regular check up with your gynecologist. Dont worry, conversion from an abnormal cell to a cancerous cell does not happen fast and hence you need not worry that your appointment is only next month. Dont fail to keep with your check up Dr Edison"},{"Patient":"Hello doctor, My wife and I are thinking of installing some infrared radiation heating panels in our house...

He had an actual bowel movement this morning (passed a turd) so my question is if stool is getting into his colon but not passing like normal how healthy is this?","Doctor":"Hello! Thank you for the query. Ileostomy means that your husbands small intestines is divided in some place (usually closely to the connection between large and small intestine). So the stools passes from stomach throughout the small intestine and gets excreted to the bag. Large intestine has no communication with the disconnected small intestine so the stool does not flows through it. However, there is possible that from time to time something will be excreted through the anus. This is normal situation as large intestine gets cleared from the \\"old stool\\" and secrets mucus.

Undergone a surgery on 20th Oct to remove a tumour (not related to any cancer ) as identified by the AIG (Asian Institute of Gasterology) doctors, Hyderabad. During Surgery doctors came to know that it is a Cancer and cant remove from her stomach as it is spreaded to liver, beside there was a jaundice and a bypass was happened in the same surgery to control it. Now the doctors suggested to contact a oncologist , understand from the oncologist that it was Cancer related to Pancreatic and ended at liver and in final stage, suggested to go with Chemotherapy , Considering her age and the above problems, Can we go ahead with this chemotherapy at this moment ??? Got to know that Chemo is very difficult to handle and the survival chances are very less. or else Can we proceed with any Ayurvedic/Homeo. Please suggest. Thanks in advance, Krishna Chalapathi. +91-0000.

Current focus of treatment is to give her good quality of life for her remaining life (typically 3-6 months).

Thanks","Doctor":"Hi, Thanks for the query. From what you have mentioned, I could not gather any symptoms for hypothyroidism. After thyroidectomy (Removal of thyroid glands) there is always a chance of Hypothyroidism, especially if it is a total thyroidectomy. If your parathyroid glands were removed, you would be also requiring certain vitamin and mineral supplementation. Since you have not mentioned about your symptoms, it would be really difficult to tell whether you are having hypothyroidism. With regards to the new lump in your neck, it is better to do a neck ultrasound scanning to see what it is. Hope you are doing regular follow ups with your treating doctor. You will need to check your thyroid hormone levels and other necessary investigations at least once in a year. Hope I have answered your question. Please let me know if you have any further queries.

He feels heaviness in left of stomach and feels pressure for motion every 1 hr , but not much of stool passed, as he hardly takes !1 juice, 2-3 spoon rice and some vegetablee in a day. He has swelling on Feet, which reduced after giving 20% Albumin for 7 days. What treatment is possible.","Doctor":"Hi, Thanks for your query. As you know, cancers mostly are detected during the late stages as in your father's case.  The swelling in the feet and bilirubin levels are due to the liver damage.  According to what you said, he is very weak  due to the toxicities of chemotherapy and moreover due to the disease process itself. Varying treatment modalities are advised by various doctors as there is no treatment which can offer a very high success rate. I would suggest to give him more nutritious food which contain high vitamins and minerals, more fruit juice and nutritional supplementation. This would improve his general health and immunity to a better state than now. The aim of treatment for now should be more on improvement of quality of life rather than the quantity of life. There are also new modalities of complementary therapies like Dendritic Cell Therapy, which is one type of Immunotherapy. Hope I have answered your question.

The main reason of a lump in group could be 1- Inguinal hernia 2- Enlarge inguinal lymph nodes 3- Benign soft tissue tumor, or lipoma Inguinal hernia could be one of the common reason, and it might cause due to the cough, i.e. increased lower abdomen pressure leading to protrusion of the abdominal contents through a weak point in groin.  Age and weight of a person  and chronic history of cough are important in ruling out this.  This is sometimes reducible i.e. by putting manual pressure or it can be irreducible. this gets more prominent while coughing As you have a history of mycosis fungoides..there is also this possibility of enlarged lymphnodes.  these are usually painless and do not change with cough or strain.

If, USG is ok then the patient should be examined for any lesion by using the speculum. What you will do? Wait for few days for any recurrence of bleeding and then if bleeding occur again go to gynaecologist for a thorough checkup."},{"Patient":"I have some problems with enlarged tonsils. Recently, I noticed a tickle in my throat , it turned out to be a little white string coming out of my tonsil. I went to my doctor, he pulled on it. It was VERY attached and hurt. He sent me to a specialist, but when I got there....the string was gone. What was it??? I m a little worried about possibly having swallowed something cancerous?","Doctor":"Dear friend, welcome to HCM! Do not worry. It is not cancer. Tonsillitis (inflammed tonsils) can have whitish patches/ pus of infection on the tonsils and they can hurt. Even if it is swallowed, nothing will happen. Continue with the advised treatment and antibiotics. If white curdy patches are forming again in the throat, rule out fungus (candida). Take care and please keep me informed of your progress. Good Luck! I hope to have answered your query satisfactorily. Thank you!"},{"Patient":"I am a breast cancer survivor stage 3c.

Thanks for your answers. kcgirl","Doctor":"Hello, History of cancer makes me suspicious of matted lymph nodes in your case. Matted nodes can seem like an elongated structure or tendon.Since you recently had PET , I think after clinical evaluation a biopsy may be considered to rule out this possibility.

The doc said she has some symptoms such as bronchitis , and an ugly rash down the back of her leg and buttock. She will be undergoing extensive testing this week. He feels she is in the 2% that does not have the normal symptoms of Hodgkins at this time.","Doctor":"Dear Wally, Hodgkin's Lymphoma doesn't cause mood swings. However, if your daughter has a suspition of Hodgkin Lymphoma recurrence, she has reasons to be scared and anxious. So, probably the mood swings are related with this anxiety. You will have to wait for the results to be sure that the lymphoma is still in remission. However, the symptoms that you describe are not tipical of a recurrence. They might represent only a respiratory tract infection. Regards, Rute Alvarez Hematologist"},{"Patient":"My husband has what looks like a blister filled with blood on his inner thigh.

His father died from melanoma . So I am looking for pictures with diagnosis.","Doctor":"Hi Cyoung, Thanks for writing in to Healthcare Magic! One important thing is if it developed suddenly say overnight or after a strenuous activity it is unlikely to be cancer rather it is just a blood filled bruise and will subside in a week. If it has been there for quite some time say over a week's duration and if aroused from a mole or he has similar lesion else where then he may be having a melanoma particularly in refence to strong family history and you must visit to a dermatologist as soon as possible.

What can be done? Can the chemotherapy cause the abdomen bulge? Is it risky? How long might he live under these conditions? Thanks a lot","Doctor":"Dear Erinda, Your uncle was diagnosed with stage 3 multiple myeloma? Or malignant melanoma? These are different diseases and so you should give more details if you can. If it is a Multiple Myeloma, he has an incurable disease but nowadays there are several new treatments available which are very effective in obtaining clinical remission. Some of these therapies may cause constipation, and so the symptoms that your uncle has, may have been caused by the treatment. For that, he should take laxatives and eventually ocasional intestinal emptyness. He should drink plenty of water and try to have a diet with high fiber content. With time it is likelly that constipation will get better.

There are several types of blood cancer, which have completely different treatments and outcome.

CTO scan say still in remission. They are painless , very nervous!!","Doctor":"Dear Brupp, I understand your concern. However, almost every person has palpable lymph nodes in the groin. In your case, they are of concern if they have more than 15 mm in its largest diameter or if they start to enlarge. If you have done recently a CT scan of that area and it says you are in remission, that means that you have normal lymph nodes. So calm down and do not worry, unless these lymph nodes start enlarging.

I do have an umbilical hernia. the pain is not in the vicinity of the hernia. It started out as cramping pain and was put on bentyl. I felt like my symptoms have not gotten better by taking the meds. Now the pain is more like burning. I took a CT scan that showed the umbilical hernia with fatty tissue. I had my gall bladder removed in march. Nothing shows up on my organs of concern according to the report. It says no inflammation or obstruction is visable in the intestines. my blood work turned up good. no high white blood cell count. This is totally aggravating me and I had to ask my doc for anxiety meds from the stress this has put on me. the burning is mostly on the upper abdomen left and right sides. put there is pain in other places. Any ideas on what this could be?","Doctor":"Hi ! Good morning. I am Dr Shareef answering your query. The umbilical hernia itself could give rise to some kind of dragging discomfort or pain in abdomen even though there might not be features of any intestinal involvement as such. However, the burning sensation in the upper abdomen could be due to a coincidental esophagitis because of GERD (gastro intestinal reflux disorder). If I were your doctor, I would advise you with the following:1) Elevate the head end of the bed with two blocks on each side, so that the regurgitation does not occur while lying down, and the contents of esophagus and stomach flow down with gravity.2) Some modification in your diet like more of roughage, enough liquids, avoidance of oily, fried, and fast food, and avoidance of alcoholic beverages and smoking if you do.3) Regular routine exercises like morning walk depending on your medical fitness.4) Prescription for a prokinetic agent and a proton pump inhibitor for symptomatic relief and to have a control on the acid production and facilitate movement of gastric contents downwards.5) Routine stool test for ova and cyst and treat them if positive.I hope this information would help you in discussing with your family physician/treating doctor in further management of your problem. Please do not hesitate to ask in case of any further doubts.Thanks for choosing health care magic to clear doubts on your health problems. I wish you an early recovery.

Renal cell carcinoma spread by inferior vena cava and inferior vena cava drains blood from lower limbs and blood goes fromright sided heart to lungs.

At this stage the first approach would be to treat the symptoms and keep the patient comfortable and pain free. Pancreatic cancer in that stage is too serious a disease to be managed at home.

Family history is definitely a risk factor. My advice for you would be to use a good mouthwash /oral rinse  to  maintain the oral hygiene( having gingivitis is an indication of poor oral hygiene) avoid further tobacco chewing , have a balanced diet which includes plenty of fruits and vegetables( to provide you with the necessary vitamins & minerals that a growing boy needs) and a multivitamin supplement .

I came to know from my friend that a person got cancer by using these products daily , he also told me they mix steroids in their products & result to breast cancer . I want to ask should i continue using this product or its a curse for my body . Thanks","Doctor":"Dear balaji.computers2011, Your query made me smile..... I have heard of many risk factors for cancer but not something like this. If there are problems with anything the medical community is very strong to report it. For example, many people began drinking raw gourd juice for its many 'benefits' but when people started getting stomach ulcerations and it was reseached scientifically they were advised to stop. Such similar complaints about the products you mention is not in the notice of the medical scientific community. Further these are available in many countries where the laws against incorrect claims are very, very strict. Whenever there are rumours regarding anything, its always prudent to test the correctness of that 'rumour' yourself before believing it. Why don't you give a few of these tablets to a government hospital or a reputed lab for drug testing? That will solve your doubts and be a scientific and wise way to deal with what 'people' say. Never believe anything unless a claim is made by a person expert in that field or an authority in that subject. This is not just about any product - its the correct way of life. Almost all problems of mankind are caused by what people 'think'. If you think anything will cause cancer then certainly it will because one tends to hypnotise the body cells into believing this. You must be aware that many a times a patient recovers from illness just because his doctor told him with great confidence - 'oh, you are going to be alright\\". Thoughts of healing promote healing and we doctors often use this tactic to encourage patients to help heal themselves. Once you are convinced that you will have no major disease, and eat sensibly, exercise enough and don't fight against what life offers you - once you flow then you don't create micro - environment changes in your own cells and genes which could cause disease or cancer. This is not very easy to explain, but if you have understood even a fraction of these words, its enough.
