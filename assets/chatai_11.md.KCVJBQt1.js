Two days later he was lethargic and had a fever. When he was readmitted to the hospital, he had multiple brain abscesses caused by Citrobacter koseri. After a prolonged illness, the baby died. A second infant with a normal pregnancy and delivery died of C. koseri meningitis after a short illness. Nine infants in the hospital nursery had umbilical cord colonization by C. koseri. Environmental cultures were negative for hospital equipment tested. How do you identify the source of infection, and what is its normal habitat?","Doctor":"hi by the above scenario looks like there was an outbreak of C. koseri in the hospital nursery. Now Citrobacter koseri belongs to Enterobacteriacea family whose members are normal inhabitants of our intestine. It can be isolated from various environmental sources like soil, sewage and as well as human feces. Since according to you environmental sources were negative for it, other possibility is improper hand hygeine practices in the hospital nursery by some staff. Hand hygeine is an essential step in health care to prevent transmission of micro-organisms. A breach in such practice can lead to an outbreak or a solitary hospital aquired infection case or many. In the case submitted by you source of infection probably are hands of healthcare staff or any other person attending these infants."},{"Patient":"How easy does achromobater- spread....and how dangerous is it.

Now since its present around his tracheal tube, dissemination in form of droplets or droplet nuclei can be there which are aerosols containing the organism (Achromobacter in this case) released in the surroundings by the patient while coughing, talking etc. these droplet nuclei can be inhaled by another person in the same room that is why your friend is given a mask and gown to prevent spread by air and contact."},{"Patient":"Got a bad case of roadrash after a mountain bike accident.

I rarely have a tempraature, usually my temp is low. My body is disentegrating. Help. Peg","Doctor":"Hi there Peg, and thank you for sharing your question with HCM.I am sorry that you have had such a bad bout with giardiasis and that even after seeing 4 specialists, you are still unwell. I would like to suggest some pointers which I hope will put you on the road to wellness.1. Firstly, I would like to rule out any lesion in the gut - have the specialists offered you colonoscopy to make sure that there is no other problem besides the infestation? Have they done blood panels for you?2. When was your last stool test? Besides checking to make sure that the parasite is completely gone, we need to look at normal intestinal flora (healthy bacteria) - are they present and if so, are they in adequate amounts? We must also consider looking for Candida (fungus) that can often take foot after treatment to clear the gut of Giardia - You must have been put on medication since the diagnosis 3 years ago to clear out the parasite. Very often, medication like this can wipe out the healthy bacteria that are essential to bowel health and well being. If this has not been done, I would recommend that you get a Comprehensive Digestive Stool test done which will also look at your nutrition besides the presence of healthy flora in your gut. Proper nutrition is essential to allow full recovery from an infestation like giardia. If possible do see a nutritional medicine doctor who can guide you with regard to proper investigations, diet and supplementation.Meanwhile, you could put yourself on prebiotics, probiotics, digestive enzymes and a good multivitamin to build up your energy. Coconut oil is sometimes used on a daily basis to rid the gut of fungal infestation. Anti-fungals are only used if stool tests prove that there is a significant fungal presence. If you are on any long term medication such as painkillers, proton pump inhibitors - these need to be stopped, but with the advice of a nutritional medicine doctor. Where nutrition is concerned, I'd recommend a gluten-free Paleo diet with perhaps 4 to 6 small meals a day to start with. You may also have to cut back on dairy products  at first because these can also cause you to \\"hit the wall'. Do stay away from any food or beverage that contains stimulants and preservatives - these irritate the gut. Also, please do not indulge in moderate or vigorous cardio workouts which will catabolize (eat up) your body's protein, thereby slowing down your recovery. Weight and resistance training is great, but in small doses at first to start with.There are many good IBS forums on the internet which can help you plan your diet and nutrition. I really hope that there is an experienced holistic or nutrition medicine doctor near you to guide you back to wellness. I hope this advice helps you. Good luck and take care.Dr Shabnam"},{"Patient":"I am a 22 year old male in the military getting ready to deploy. 156lbs 5'11\\" lean build. I have only had blister problems once and that was with cheap boots. I now own a set of Nike combat boots and have been very comfortable until yesterday when I got a red sore spot on the right side of my right heal feels like a blister coming on but when I put moleskin over it, it doesn't help. What could this be and how can I help it?","Doctor":"Hi there and thanks for sharing your question with us at HCM.It seems as though the red spot you have described is a developing blister. Sadly, heel blisters can occur even with the highest quality footwear. As you are about to be deployed, I think understanding the mechanics behind the development of a heel blister can help, given that you have experienced them once before. As we walk or run, the heel bone normally gets pulled up by the Achilles tendon. However, once the calf tendons get tight with prolonged usage (with prolonged running / walking), the heel bone is lifted even sooner and with more force. All you need is extra friction (which is provided by socks and the shoe lining) to cause shearing of the soft tissue and skin overlying the heel bone. This repetitive shearing results in micro-tears beneath the skin, eventually resulting in a painful, fluid-filled cavity (blister). Some individuals are still blister-prone despite providing themselves with the most comfortable and finest footwear. Here are a few strategies used by my blister-prone patients:1. Minimise friction by keeping your foot firmly in your shoe (do not allow your heel free movement as you walk or run) - lace up fully. Of course, ensure that your socks and shoes fit you well. 2. Stretch the calves properly (30 seconds) before and after exertion3. I understand that you have tried moleskin - consider trying a patch that sticks to the inside of the shoe like an ENGO patch - it will save you time (considering you are in the military). With regard to the current blister, do not remove the roof - this leaves the blister sterile and allows it to heal properly. If it has burst, remove the dead skin with a sterile pair of scissors, clean the wound and have it dressed properly. Check it daily to pick up any infection early.Hope this helps. Good luck on your deployment.Dr Shabnam"},{"Patient":"Good morning! I have considered getting off of my HBP medication Atenolol and resort to a more herbal remedy as in supplements(capsules,powders) or teas.

It is found in many of our body's cavities. It contains proteins, water and cells necessary for day to day functioning. So when there is a wound, serous fluid can sometimes seep out (exudate). Please do not try to use a scissors on your wound. Gently clean it to prevent infection and dress it.

Since if proper measures are not undertaken, this infection is likely to recur. The following treatment and prevention recommended for pinworm infection.-A single oral dose of Mebendazole or Albendazole, repeated in two weeks, is effective in the eradication of pinworms.-Do not use your toothpaste to get rid of the worms as it is not effective in the total eradication of the worms.-You may apply carbolated petrolatum or other antipruritic creams or ointments to the perianal region may relieve itching. The infection can be prevented by:1. All family members or classmates must be treated simultaneously.2. Personal and group hygiene must be improved: You must wash your hands before eating, and refrain from activities such as scratching the perianal area), finger-sucking, nail-biting, and your nails should be trimmed.3. To reduce your risk of getting or spreading infection, wash your hands thoroughly after having a bowel movement or changing a diaper and before eating.4. Daily morning bathing and daily changing of underwear help remove a large proportion of eggs. Showering is preferred to avoid possible contamination of bathwater.5. Careful handling and frequent changing of underclothing, nightclothes, towels, and bedding can help reduce infection, reinfection, and environmental contamination with pinworm eggs.These items should be laundered in hot water, especially after each treatment of the infected person, and after each usage of washcloths until the infection is cleared.Hope I have answered your query.

If your child has contracted chickenpox, he/she should not go swimming or play contact sports unless all blisters have crusted over. This normally takes place a week after the first rash started. Try to avoid public places, as others may catch the virus, which may be dangerous, especially to those who are pregnant or have a weak immune system.

The burning lasted for two days and is now coming to a stop, but now I have some weird discharge at the end of urinating. What could this be?","Doctor":"the classical features of mono are fever, sore throat, spleenomegaly. the reason for burning micturition and increased frequency may  be due to infection of urinary tract. mono is less likely to cause urinary infection. should get the urine analysis done for diagnosis and should consult the doctor. weird discharge may be pus or increased secretions. need early treatment."},{"Patient":"hello, i think i have chicken pox, i noticed spots this morning and thought nothing of it, and wasnt going to let being ill affect me since today is my 16th birthday. when i got home, they had infected more of my body, i have already noticed some in my mouth and throat, should i be worried?  also should i be worried that my eyes itch. i really dont want my eyes infected. and i'm getting stressed as i'm in my exam period.","Doctor":"rash over the body and mouth and throat is suggestive of viral infection surely. need to consult the doctor at the earliest and take medicine for the same. more over chicken pox or varicella zoster is contagious infection, you need to be at home and isolate your self. you will have to take a break and give exam later on."},{"Patient":"Hi:I have had fibrocystic breast conditin for many years.

In my opinion, it is better to take a complete blood picture to rule out deficiency anemia. Weakness and fatigue can be experienced by any individual recovering from illness, as body fights with the infection throughout the illness making one feel tired without any apparent physical activity. Malaria can even cause iron deficiency anemia with weakness, fatigue as malaria causing parasite feeds on and break down red blood cells, leading to anemia. If the test results show anemia, consult a doctor or update the reports at HCM or start with iron supplements available over the counter. Get vision checked by optometrist. Weight loss is common after recovering from sickness, nothing to worry eat fresh and nutritious food, take ample of rest and take a multivitamin for quick recovery.Good luck.

I have carefully worked through your case, and can well realize your health worries. Being your physician, I want to assure, I will take care all of your medical concerns.This is fungal infection. When the sweating comes down from the back, it accumulates and makes the area of the \\"butt crack\\" humid. Fungus loves such areas and Tinea is the notorious fungus in this regard.This leads to what is known in medical science as 'Jock Itch'.To treat it:-If I was your treating physician I would have prescribed you with Hydrozole Cream and Loratadine by mouth. Apply the cream on the area after cleaning the skin properly.Yes, cleanliness is the key to remain away from such problems. Use cotton-only dress (especially the undergarments). Wear loose clothes. Don't use tight jeans.Avoid hot and humid environment. Avoid unnecessary sunlight exposure. Take plenty of clean drinking water and after some physical activity (sweating) try to take a shower. Don't use scented soaps. Take shower with Oatmeal Milk and Honey Body Wash instead. It will also help get better fast.Hope I answered all of your questions.

Tuberculosis is diagnosed by finding Mycobacterium tuberculosis bacteria in a clinical specimen taken from the patient. Generally, the organism is looked for as acid-fast bacilli (AFB) by Zeil-Nelson (ZN) stain.PCR test is a reliable test for tuberculosis.  PCR or gene probe tests can distinguish M. tuberculosis from other mycobacteria. It is mainly used to detect the bactria in extra-pulmonary lesions rather than pulmonary tuberculosis and whose culture is negative. Once you have been diagnosed and AKT 4 has been started, you need to take the drugs regularly for the specified period even if the tests done are negative. If the treatment is discontinued in between, it gives a chance for organisms to strike back with resistance, which would be difficult to treat. Once you are done with the treatment course and your evaluation suggests good recovery, you can go ahead for conceiving. Till then, keep it on hold. Hope the information provided would be useful.

People who have chlamydia often do not have outward symptoms in the early stages. It can cause health problems in the later stages, including preventing women from getting pregnant or even endangering their pregnancies. Unprotected sex without a condom and unprotected oral sex are the main ways a chlamydia infection can spread. It need not be penetration one. Even touching genitals together may also transmit the bacteria. It can also be contracted during anal sex. Most people don’t notice the symptoms of chlamydia. Symptoms  appear usually one to three weeks after you have been infected. Some of the most common symptoms include:1. burning sensation during urination2. discharge from the penis or vagina (yellow or green)3. pain in the lower abdomen4. pain in the testicles5. painful sexual intercourse in womenThe most effective diagnostic test for chlamydia is to swab the vagina in women and to test the urine in men. Chlamydia infection is easy to treat. Antibiotic used include Azithromycin in a single, large dose, but the dose may also be spread out over 5 days or Doxycycline to be taken twice per day for one week.

Norovirus infection is characterized by nausea, projectile vomiting, malodorous watery diarrhea, abdominal pain, loss of taste, lethargy, weakness, muscle aches, headache, and low-grade fever. There is no specific medicine to treat people with norovirus illness.  Treatments aim to avoid complications such as dehydration from fluid loss.

I am 49 years old and was sick with the Epstein Barr virus in November of 2014.I am still suffering from extreme fatigue and muscle pain. I was looking for a doctor who specializes in this where I live in Toledo, Ohio. Can you please help me?","Doctor":"Dr. Hanif warmly welcomes you!Thanks for consulting at my virtual clinic HCM. I have carefully worked through your case, and can well realize your health worries. Being your physician, I want to assure, I will take care all of your medical concerns.Infectious mononucleosis patients feel body pains and fatigue and these are common to all the patients with EBV infection. This pain and fatigue may go long enough, sometimes becomes chronic pain and fatigue.Rest is the key to early recovery in this case. Do as much rest as you can. No vigorous activities. Avoid strenuous exercises as they may lead to rupture of the inflamed/enlarged spleen that may be life threatening if not treated surgically. Viral infections get better with rest and also there is less fatigue and symptomatic relief from malaise. You may take Tylenol for mild fever and body-aches. Do gargles with Luke-warm saltwater to soothe the throat and get prompt relief. The throat vial load and shedding also decreases with it.The long term treatment for the EBV Infectious mononucleosis is only FOLLOW UP AND CONSERVATIVE TREATMENT. We have to deal with the symptoms and diagnose the complications early and refer the patient to the specific specialist for the complication developed. There is not a single specialist for EBV IM disease. But You may definitely ask your primary care physician to refer you to an Infectious Disease Specialist in Toledo Ohio. Even this specialist will adopt a multidisciplinary approach and may need to involve different specialists if needed with time, e.g.:-*Its a disease that may involve tonsils with severe infection and swelling and may even need intubation--A need for referral to an Ottorhinolaryngologist and Head and Neck Surgeon.*If anemia or thrombocytopenia ensues--Hematologist involvement needed.*If Central Nervous system involvement--A Neurologist jumps in.*If infections of the heart (Myocarditis) ensues--A Cardiologist referral needed.* If hepatitis or gallbladder infection comes as a complication of EBV chronic infection--A Gastroenterologist consultation is needed.It is your primary care physician who will decide when you need referral and to whom should he refer you. I suggest you to keep proper follow-up with your treating physician.Hope I answered all of your questions. Please don't forget to add your precious positive feedback to help me able to assist you better in future too. Have a wonderful time ahead. Keep in touch for a follow-up too to let me know if you have any doubts & need further assistance. I am available 24/7 for your help. Have a blessed time ahead. Regards!DR.

I read your query and I understand your concern.Genital condiloma (genital warts) is caused by a virus called Human Papilloma Virus (HPV). In most of cases, condyloma that can be seen with eye, can be diagnosed by history and physical examination. If the condyloma is inside the vagina it can be diagnosed by colposcopy. During colposcopy doctor uses an instrument called colposcope to examine your cervix, vagina and vulva. Application of 3–5% solutions of acetic acid may help in thevisualization of condiloma , but it is not very effective way to make the diagnosis. Pap- test can easily make the diagnosis of HPV. Other way for make the diagnosis is the biopsy of the lession. The doctor take a sample of condyloma and examine it . Beside this the most specific tests are virologic tests, which use special techniques such as polymerase chainreaction or the hybrid capture assay for identifing viruses. These tests may detect the presence of virus and identify the specific virus type.HPV vaccination is recommended for 11 and 12 year-old girls. It is also recommended for girls and women age 13 through 26 years of age who have not yet been vaccinated or completed the vaccine series. The HPV vaccine isn't recommended for people over age 26, because it hasn't been studied well enough in this age group.In case that you are HPV positive, frequently used therapies include cryosurgery, application of caustic agents, electrodesiccation, surgical removal, and removal with a laser.Cryosurgery is the initial treatment of choice for condyloma acuminatum. Both failure and recurrence have been documented with all of these methods of treatment. You can also use topical medications such as Podofilox or Imiquimod. Podofilox, 0.5% solution or gel twice daily for 3 days, followed by 4 days without therapy. This cycle may be repeated four times. Imiquimod, 5% cream 3 times per week for up to 16 weeks. You can make the right choice talking with your doctor.Hope I helped with my answer.

I m currently 23, Male, and I am just feeling anxious over a lot of things. I m experiencing back pains, small but sharp chest pains, and breathing problems. I ve had a history of smoking cigars and I currently vape. I also have had bad posture for a long time because I stay in front of the computer a lot, doing my full-time job online. But I don t have a proper desk or a proper chair. I use cushions and I sit on the floor with my wooden table that is ground level. I also don t exercise very much. I go out few times a week, walk around, eat, and rarely dance (a hobby of mine). I also don t eat very healthy either. I ve been waking up late, sleeping late, I eat two half-assed meals a day ranging from a pack of ramen to whatever my mom ends up cooking me. Saying all this, I just want to know... What s the exact cause to my problem? Is it everything I do added up which lead to the mess I m in? And is there a way to bounce back from this? What can I do to get a healthy lifestyle so I don t potentially die from all this?","Doctor":"Hello and Welcome to ‘Ask A Doctor’ service. I have reviewed your query and here is my advice. I would like to tell you that bad posture, unhealthy eating and poor sleeping habits can lead to disturbed stomach and can be the cause of heart burn but considering your smoking history, a basic cardiac evaluation is advisable. Kindly get an ECG and echocardiography done, improve your sleeping/eating habits, take over the counter antacid medication. Hopefully this information will guide you properly.

I am concerned; Thank you","Doctor":"Hi Dear,Welcome to HCM.Understanding your concern. As per your query small painless swellings inside right cheek is because of tissue overgrowth and it happens mostly due to trauma to the oral mucosa due  to cheek bite when the mucosa comes in between the teeth while chewing, it could be because of traumatic bite, chronic traumatic irritation to mucosa. It could be due to sharp edges of tooth causing trauma to the cheek leading to tissue fibroma. I would suggest you to see an dentist once and get it examined. Visit oral surgeon as well. Go for its complete examination and excision. A biopsy may be required if a cause is not determined. Visit oral pathologist in that case.Hope your concern has been resolved.Get well soon.Best Wishes,Dr. Harry Maheshwari"},{"Patient":"Sunday I woke up with a bad headache and started getting quesy and for the next 14 hours I was throwing up almost every hour and when I was done each time I broke out in a sweat and then got chills.

I read your query and I understand your concern.Rabies post exposure profilaxis is an emergency and it should not be delayed. Profilaxis may be discontinued if the animal involved remains healthy for an observation period of 10 days.In case of  previously vaccinated persons, as your case is, the profilaxis differs.First of all you should do a local treatment of the wound. In this case there is no need for Anti rabies immunoglobuline. You can follow one of these two schedules: 1. one dose on days 0 and 3. The dose is either 1 standard intra muscular dose (which may be 1 ml or 0.5 ml depending on vaccine type ) or one intradermal dose of 0.1 ml per site.2. a 4-site (one visit only) intradermal PEP consisting of 4 injections of0.1 mL distributed on each arm and thigh or suprascapular region on days 0. You can talk to your doctor to make a good decision of which schedule to use.Beside this i would recommend to vaccinate the cat if you can, as it spends some days with you.Hope I helped with my answer.

Homeopathic medicine may not be that useful to treat this condition. Even in allopathy, you can only control the disease but you cannot cure the illness. You can do the following things to keep your disease under check and control:1. Antihistamines that help alleviate itching.2. Topical corticosteroid cream or ointment to reduce swelling and redness.3. Systemic Corticosteroid such as prednisone helps when lichen planus lasts a long time.4. PUVA therapy is a light treatment that can help clear the skin.5. Retinoic acid applied to the skin or given as a pill to clear the skin.6. Tacrolimus ointment or pimecrolimus cream is used to treat eczema.Hope you consult a Dermatologist to get yourself properly evaluated and managed well.

Remove the sting carefully if it is still present at the bite site. 3. Apply ice packs to reduce swelling. 4. Take Tablet. Paracetamol combination twice a day for 3 days after food. 5.

Thanks!!","Doctor":"Hi, Thanks for posting in HCM.I understand your concern of HPV infection as you are going in for IUI.Generally, in most of the Semen Banks, they will screens for the following sexually transmissible infections: HIV-1/2, HTLV-1/2, hepatitis B, hepatitis C, syphilis, and CMV. Also they will do a clinical examination for sexually transmitted diseases before taking the semen sample. In case of HPV infection in men, the common presentation is genital warts. Even though it is not tested by laboratory means, such subjects having lesions in genital area indicating sexually transmitted disease should be rejected from sperm donation. Hence, you need not be worried about HPV even though it is not tested in laboratory. You can just confirm weather the center is doing fitness by means of clinical examination. Then you can go ahead with the procedure of IUI. Hope the information provided is clear.

I have gone through your question and understand your concern. Looks like a case of gastritis, it can be taken care of but if symptom does not subside she may need to see a doctor. Firstly, rehydration is the key, oral rehydration fluids available over the counter have to be taken in small sips as much as possible. Secondly, for fever take Panadol as and when needed not more than thrice a day till fever subside and Pepto-Bismol to protect stomach from acidity caused by intake of drugs for fever. Simple gastritis resolves on its own in a week, so relax and wait for few days.Consult a doctor, if symptoms get worse or does not seem to improve over a week time and signs of dehydration like concentrated urine, decreased skin elasticity, dry mouth, sunken eyes, rapid heartbeat and excessive thirst. Good luck. Hope your concern is answered. Thank You."},{"Patient":"my boyfriend fell the other day and a nail punctured his back. He said the nail was not rusty and the incident happened in an attic while repairing someone's air conditioning, so according to him less risky insofar it wouldn't have been exposed to much soil, dirt and moisture--places where bacteria thrive and tend to be more of a risk factor. However I don't share the same logic as him in that respect, and even if considering his situation \\"less risky\\" than if it had happened on a construction site (for instance), I hardly find his assessment convincing given the strangeness of the symptoms I've witnessed since. The incident occured approx. two days ago and here is what Ive noticed from what I can see. He tells me has not experienced any internal symptoms like nausea, fever etc.*The primary location of what appears to me as an obvious infection of some sort localized at the site of the nail puncture. You cant see a deep puncture wound at all. I may not even have noticed it if he didn't tell me how his skin got so irritated. In the center the color is mostly a pale whitish color, perhaps slightly yellowish in tone, and is a bit swollen and bumpy--the bumps look like clogged oil glands or the start of a zit if zits were more translucent rather than red and as well were filled with a yellow-tinted clear substance rather than the more dense/solid type consistency of a zit. Its almost like puss that would come from a blister or a boil if one tried to sweeze it out but of course fails and instead just breaks open the skin (not realizing of course that boils are beyond surface deep and so can't be \\"popped\\" just like zits). At any rate there is some blotchiness in the center that spreads into a red loosely shaped-rashy looking thing with more bumps, a couple of which are much larger than the rest. The largest bump, which was where the puncture wound occurred has already started to drain on its own, and seems to be pretty constant for the past 8 hrs. I noticed after a few hrs since he had me look at the first bump that had started to drain that there are multiple, much smaller bumps that seem to be getting a bit larger and producing puss, but none of them have broken in order to drain and I do not want to irritate the area more by doing anything aggressive to it, even though it would be nice to prevent this from escalating. Lastly the skin in that area is a bit drier looking and rough. What concerns me most however is that I noticed he has a red rashy kind of mark about 5 inches away from the other. If it's the same thing symptomatically and not just a strange coincidence, I am worried the infection is potentially more dangerous to his health, and perhaps even mine if he is highly contagious at all. I am not a trained medical professional, but from what I do know, logic would lead me to believe its not just a sureface level infection--by which I mean that whatever it is, it is being spread throughout his blood and not just a \\"skin irritation\\" at this point, which can be taken care of by something like Neosporin. Could this possibly be telling of a much more serious condition? Lastly, I don't know how relevant this is, but about two months ago my boyfriend got a staff infection from a spider bite, which he similarly disregarded as a simple non-serious ailment until it swelled so much he worried it would burst or cause a blood clot, etc. He went to a physician, got antibiotics and took them regularly for about a week or so. Then he started forgetting and just stopped altogether, having only used about a quarter of the bottle. About a week later his finger appeared to the swell up again and worsen in the same direction as it had when it first got infected. When noticing the infection returned I told him he had to take ALL the pills, and also stop and relax for a few minutes of the day since all work and no play (so to speak) can aggravate infections when under stress, and that its important to take all the precribed medication because how one feels is not always a good indication of how well the medicine precribed has worked to actually rid someone from the infection. In his case then, furthermore important to finish his prescription according to the prescribed dosage times, since healing his finger from the spider was one thing, but staff has different methods of operation--variables, in general--that may make it so that the primary bite site is healed while the rest of the body is still exposed to the irritating source in ways that are not visible to the naked eye or generally occuring upon obvious parts of the body. Could his staff have need been truly cured, and now that he punctured his skin it made his vulnerable enough to awaken it from an otherwise dormant or otherwise un-bothersome state?Thank you! I am very worried and intrigued to find out at well!","Doctor":"Hi, thanks for using healthcare magicThere is a risk of infection with puncture of any area of the body. The presence of a pus filled blister indicates that there is an infection present.This would need treatment with topical and possibly oral antibiotics.Though the nail may not have been dirty he still needs to assess whether he needs a tetanus vaccine.If he received a tetanus shot within the last 5 yrs, it is  not necessary but if this is not the case then he needs to find out if a booster is required.I hope this helps"},{"Patient":"I have a very strange heart pump since last week. it happens a few times.

Your symptoms seem to point to your lungs - I worry if there is bronchiectasis (permanent enlargement of airways in the lung due to chronic infection). In fact, the high hemoglobin you have had for the past 4 - 5 years could explain this fact i.e. your blood has had to compensate for the reduced oxygenation by your lung by increasing its oxygen-carrying capacity. The high ESR indicates an ongoing inflammatory or infectious process.A few questions to help pinpoint your problem:1. Are you a smoker? if so, how many pack years?2. Did you suffer a bad chest infection a few years ago?3. Any exposure to fungus (working in moldy environment, stored grain or compost)? I would like to rule out aspergillosis.I strongly recommend you see a doctor to get a proper infectious disease panel done (both blood and sputum) along with a proper chest x ray.

Humoral response is the production of antibodies which are specific to the pathogen causing infection and these antibodies attach themselves to the pathogen causing its death.Antibodies are usually immunoglobulins (Ig). There are 5 types of Immunoglobulins in our body. IgG, IgA, IgM, IgE and IgD. If there is a B-cell deficiency, there will be low levels of Immnuoglobulns produced.IL-2, 4 and 6 are factors which are called cytokines which modulate the cell differentiation and hence affect the cell mediated immunity.Deficiency of these factors may cause depletion of both B cells and T cells.Thanks"},{"Patient":"hi , at the weekend i experinced symptoms that seemed like thrush as i have had this before, on monday i took the pill which you put up your vagina and also i use the cream 3 times a day last time i had thrush it got better after taking these however today i am in real bad pain i can barely move and was wondering whether this is normal or could this not be thrush ?","Doctor":"Hi, this is not normal and you may be having a different infection from thrush.  The pain is definitely not normal. You will need to see your regular doctor for this.1. Pain indicates that the infection that you thought you have treated has worsened. Your doctor will have to do a speculum exam and maybe send some swabs for further studies. Other infections such as vaginosis have to be considered.2. The other things to look at are hygiene (usage of pH-unfriendly vaginal cleansers, pantyliners, pads etc.) and your sugar control. Impaired sugar control can lead to recurrent infections. 3.

About a month later she found a mass under her right nipple, then she began showing signs of infection, redness, warmth by the nipple, low grade temps.

The best measure taken is to quit smoking which will benefit in long run. Excision of the central nipple including the obstructed ducts, have been found successful. As for now, you may take care of the infection at home by simple measure. Avoid massage or applying raw food to the affected area. Avoid unnecessary touching and wearing clothes that may further irritate the skin. Clean the affected area with antiseptic liquid like Betadine poured over a sterile piece of gauze once a day.

I read carefully your query and I understand your concern.Your problem description is  clear ,you have a fungal skin infection, first of all I recommend you to go to a dermatologist for a specialist treatment, because this infection have a long live and they can go with the treatment but usually they are repeated infection. My other recommendation is to have an accurate hygiene, you should avoid the contact with the other towel of your family and if you have another person that have fungal infection you should cure at the same time for have more effect the cure, because the spores distribution can repeat the infections even if you will be cured.The  treatment of this infection begin with a well diagnosed problem, so you should go to the dermatologist and there he/she will take a fragment of your  infected skin and sent it  to a laboratory  for testing and confirm the diagnose, after taken the result you will be prescribed anti fungal topical treatments like Ketokonazol 2% cream or other, if your fungal infection have a large area affected skin or if you  will don’t work the topical treatment you should take anti fungal tablets, that can occasionally cause side effects like stomach problems, skin irritation and during this treatment you should monitor your liver functional test. If your  symptoms disappear its important   continuing the treatment up to two weeks, because if you interrupts them probably the infections has more trend to repeat or being resistant for the medication you take.

Diagnosis can be confirmed by  XRay chest , Montoux's test and sputum for AFB.3 Allergic bronchitis is another reason of such symptoms .When such patient visit I advise my patient to take montelukast+bambuterol tablet once or twice in day according to severity of symptoms ( normal dose is one tablet at night time ).Also take some cough syrup containing chlorampheniramine+ dextromethophan + ambroxol .However , there are so many other reasons of such symptoms but physical examination is important in this case because symptoms are for 8-9 months so consult a physician and get his opinion."},{"Patient":"I had a pilonidal cyst/sinus excised a few years ago and now I am experiencing similar pains to those which I felt previously. There is very little to see though (only 2 very small 'pimple' like things) although the pain had been quite severe at times (similar to the level I experience when it was infected prior to my original op). Is it possible for the sinus to recur in this 'hidden' fashion with little or no visible signs on the surface?","Doctor":"Hello As you mentioned that few years ago you got surgery ( excision ) . Pilonidal sinus a sheaf of hairs and usually recurrence is possible if not excised properly . As you mentioned that there are two holes ( actually these small holes are opening of pilonidal sinus ) , so in my opinion consult another surgeon and get his opinion.However,in pilonidal sinus surgery is only an option . Since this is a sheaf of hairs so in my opinion laser is not so effective option. Open surgery is the best treatment .Till take pain killers."},{"Patient":"For the past year and a half I have had night sweats and then since oct 2010 I have had breathlessness, fatigue, small lymph nodes,fevers,itching and when I drink alcohol my lymph nodes hurt. My consultant thinks these are from tb as I tested positive with the quanitferon test in June 2009. I have been on treatment for 5 weeks with no improvement and have developed a cough which is not there all the time. I have had a normal ct scan to check for lymphoma. Is this tb or could it be lymphoma.","Doctor":"Hello thanks for asking from HCM for your doubtsI can understand your concern. You are suffering from night sweats, breathlessness, fatigue, fevers, palpable lymph nodes, itching etc symptoms since last 5 years. You were positive with Quantiferon test in June 2009. These symptoms can be seen classically in tuberculosis especially in extra pulmonary tuberculosis. You also have developed cough which can be considered as a symptom. To confirm the diagnosis I will suggest you to visit a physician. Get your total blood work up along with ESR done. Raised ESR is one of common finding in TB. Also get your lymph node biopsy, chest X ray done. This will help to find out any granulomatous lesion of TB. Also get repeat Quantiferone test done. These tests will supplement the diagnosis. If everything comes negative then we can think of some other possibilities. Saroidiosis, Lymphoma could be other rare possibilities. Visit a physician for help. Thanks, Hope this helps. Good Luck"},{"Patient":"I have a sore, itchy anus combined with feeling really sick. I thought I was pregnant and so took a home pregnancy test which was negative. However i still feel very sick and my sore bum is really getting to me. I feel great in all other respects. Help!","Doctor":"Hi, Thanks for posting in HCM. The symptoms you have mentioned like soreness and itchy anus does not suggest anything related to pregnancy. You might be having fissure in ano which is making you sick. Kindly avoid constipation as it precepites this condition. For this you can take laxatives, high fibre diet and keep yourself well hydrated. You need to take an opinion from Surgeon to manage this condition. Hope the information is clear. All the best."},{"Patient":"Dear Doctor, Last year I was stung by a bee/wasp/hornet... I am not sure to be honest.  I was outside splitting white ash wood, to which I have a minor allergic reaction.  I have been stung many times in the past, by all types of insects, and I had never had a reaction.  This time, I puffed up like a blowfish, had welts all over my body, and my breathing became very constricted and labored.  I immediately went to the hospital and was discharged a few hours later.  A couple of months later, I was tested for bee/vespid allergens and everything came up negative.  Ok, so at this point I was more perplexed and disconcerted than anything, especially when no physician could give me a good answer as to what happened.  Just today, I was stung again while cutting the grass.  I am not sure by what type of bee or vespid.  This time, there was no reaction, except for pain and a little bit of swelling at the sting site, which was a couple of inches below my knee.  The only thing I can think of that explains the critical moment I had last year was that when I was stung then, it was directly on a major vein on my right hand.  Do you have any thoughts on this?  I would greatly appreciate any insight. Sincerely, Tony","Doctor":"Hello Tony, It is unfortunate that you have contacted with sting bite. Determine if the stinger is still present (look for a small black dot at the sting site) and remove it immediately if is visible in the wound. Apply ice or cold packs to the area to reduce the body's inflammatory response.Clean the area with mild soap and water. Then apply hydrocortisone cream to the site to decrease the severity of the reaction. You may also apply calamine lotion to reduce the swelling.Taking an antihistamine such as diphenhydramine and pain relievers such as ibuprofen or acetaminophen can also provide relief of symptoms. Hope the information provided would be useful."},{"Patient":"My mother was confirmed having a typhoid fever but she didn t admitted to the hospital (patient s decision) so the Doctor gave her cefixime as her medicine to be taken for 7 days, she is taking the cefixime for 3 days now.

This bacteria usually does not cause serious infections and is sensitive to many common antibiotics. Your doctor has correctly prescribed appropriate antibiotics to deal with your respiratory infection. If you have any other infection, it may respond to this antibiotic. It is not a contagious infection but can spread through droplets while coughing and sneezing. I suggest you avoid close contact with family till you are better.

So far, except for theytypcial raging sore throat for 3 days and lymph nodes still swollen, she has experienced little discomfort. However, 2 days ago she started to find little raised bumps on her face and thought it might be pimples from bronzing cream she had used. She now has them on her arms, ears and bottom of her feet. Not red, more skin coloured and not really itchy. Could this rash be from the mono virus?","Doctor":"Hello,Welcome to Health Care Magic. I read your query and I understand your concerns.Yes, this rash be from the mono virus. The common symptoms usually consist of fever, pharyngitis, and lymphadenopathy, but sometimes a rash could be present. Mono rash is a common symptoms experienced when affected with mononucleosis. It usually develops on 7 to 10 days after treatment with beta-lactam antibiotics such as ampicillin, amoxicillin and cephalosporins. Typically this rash is tan or brownish in color. Since the color is quite different than the typical very red allergic-type rash, this should not be misinterpreted as a penicillin allergy.If such rashes appear then it is a clear indication of hypersensitivity reaction to antibiotic. However, this is not a real allergy and does not mean that the person is allergic to such medications.  This rash indicates a ‘hypersensitivity reaction’ to the antibiotic. If the antibiotic is given later on in the absence of EBV infection the reaction doesn't occur, so it is not a true allergy. However, because the shape and distribution of the rash of infectious mononucleosis plus antibiotics are similar to an allergic-type rash, they could be often confused by patients and clinicians.Hope I helped with my answer.

Being your physician, I want to assure, I will take care all of your medical concerns.YOUR ANSWERS ONE BY ONE:-I can't justify the reason for which the physician gave her Maalox. Stop this medication right away. It has no indication to prescribe her this medication.Carry on with Tylenol for infants. It is good for her.She is taking very little diet. She will take baby food (fruits and vegetables, prunes and cereals). Gerber multigrain cereals, and Gerber baby second foods are the foods I am talking about. She has sore throat and due to that she is unable to take much food.How is her diapers? Is she properly wetting the diapers? To avoid dehydration give her Pedialyte of a flavour she likes.Take fresh pure honey, add it to warm some water and fill in the sippy cup. It is best for her.In her room, use Vicks Warm mist humidifier and she will get a nice night sleep and it will avoid nasal stuffiness. Add vicks pad to this humidifier (not more than one in 48 hours and no direct mist to the face of baby).Apply and rub vicks vaporub on the chest, neck, arms and hands to soothe her and get better soon.Hope I answered all of your questions.

Keep the area clean and hygienic by washing the area with warm water and mild antiseptic solution like Savlon. You can also use V wash instead. Apply Soframycin skin cream twice daily.

Since you have undergone laprotomy, it takes some time for wound to heal internally, although externally it appears alright. It may take anytime from 15 days to 1 month for complete healing to take place. Hence, during this time, when you want to bend, you need to give abdominal support and do the activity slowly. Until 3 months avoid lifting of heavy weights and take care of activities that would not increase abdominal pressure. Pain is not the only symptom of infection.

Would it be appropriate to take choline to help with some of the above symptoms?","Doctor":"Hello and Welcome to ‘Ask A Doctor’ service. I have reviewed your query and here is my advice. I would explain that Choline could help improve the fatigue and memory problems. But it has no effects on the mood swinging and depression. An antidepressant could help improve all of your symptoms. In this regard, I would recommend trying Duloxetine. Hope to have been helpful! Wishing good health. Dr. Iliri"},{"Patient":"I have ringworm and its so itchy at night, is it the cream kicking in? I ran my hand under running cold water for relief. Yes I had a good scratch at it and I am tired right now. I am also worried. Once the cream is being used; am I less likely to spread it anywhere else?","Doctor":"Hello, thanks for posting on HCM.Ringworm is caused due to fungal infection of tinea species.You didn’t mention what cream you are applying to the hand. If it contains antifungal agents like ketoconazole, clotrimazole or any of azole containing agents then use it 2-3 times a day.If you feel that cream isn’t working or no effective, you can also try taking oral antifungals such as fluconazole 150mg once a day for 5 to 7 days. Keep the area clean and dry. Try to avoid itching. There are antifungal powders also available which will reduce the itch.You might transmit the fungal infection by direct touch, so avoid contact of the affected area to other members and households until you see regression of the affected area.I hope I have helped your query.   Thank you"},{"Patient":"good day Dri would have gone to the hospital now, but today being Sunday i just have to wait till tomorrow, but as a medical student the little knowledge i have i suspect i have sinusitis...i have fever,headaches, little blunt pain around my right cheek bone, the mucus from my right nostril stinks like rotten egg..... i smoke cigarettes regularly, and i smoke marijuana like 3-4 times daily. some of my friends say that nicotine is really really bad for sinusitis and i believe them and i have already stopped, but i dont want to believe that marijuana is also the same situation.","Doctor":"Thanks to HCM I can understand your concern Sinusitis is aggravated by smoking ,exposure to cold environment and cold items .so try to avoid theses things my dear moreover now you need to take antipyretics like paracetamol 5oo mg thrice daily along with antihistamincs like cetrigine 10mg once daily , plz use nasal drops if there is nasal blockage inhale steam or vapour from boiled water as it relieves ur headache .making feeling of light don't worry be away from bad habits whch spoil your health ,you should be ideal to others being a medical student . ok"},{"Patient":"Hi, My daughter is having 102 - 103 temp every night at 8.00 PM for the last 4 days and having Anti biotics. + medicines for temperatures, but the case is still same every day and she feel sleepy with shivering.

As per the x-ray finding you have some shadow in the lungs, have you been tested for presence of tuberculosis infection? If you have cough, have you done sputum examination for AFB (acid fast bacillus)? I would also advise you to consult an infectious disease specialist as you have not specified any other symptom you have along with fever, and it would need detailed examination and proper investigations to be done. It’s also important to rule out the presence of any lymphoma by detailed examination as it Is also known to cause unexplained non infective reason for fever for long time.For now I can advise you not to take it lightly and consult your doctor about the same.

I read carefully your query and I understand your concerns.The trasmission pathways of HBV are via infected blood (e.g transfusion) or blood contamined equipments(unsterile needles e.g having a tattoo, piercing, or having dental procedures etc.) and infected body fluids (unprotected sex).Regarding the possible treatment of your child, I would strongly recommend to you to have prenatal care because in utero infection is uncommon, representing no more than 5 percent of perinatal HBV infections. With such a presentation on my clinic I would recommend Hepatitis B Vaccine - first dose of the vaccine series and Hepatitis B immunoglobulin (HBIG) - 1 or 2 dose to be given immediately in the delivery room (or within the first 12 hours of life), then there is more than a 95% chance that a newborn will avoid a chronic HBV infection.Hope I helped with my answer.

I ve just found out I have 3-4 very small genital warts in the same Area. The doctor sprayed them with liquid nitrogen today but they are still itchy and I m worried about them spreading. Is there anything else I can do to prevent more appearing?","Doctor":"Hello,Welcome to Health Care Magic. I read carefully your query and I understand your concerns.Normally, warts can disappear by themselves, and need no treatment if the aren't causing discomfort. But if your symptoms include itching, burning and pain, or if visible warts are causing emotional distress, I could recommend you clear the outbreak with medications or surgery. The recommended medicines that can be applied include podofilox 0.5% solution or gel (Condylox) and trichloroacetic acid (TCA), which kill the wart tissue, or Aldara, a cream that stimulates your immune system to fight the virus. Other options include freezing the warts with liquid nitrogen (cryotherapy), as your treating doctor performed,  cauterizing them with heat or a laser, or removing them surgically. Cryotherapy with liquid nitrogen has to be repeat every 1–2 weeks. However, the lesions are likely to come back after treatment.I am sorry to ask you for your gender,since it isn't mentioned, but if you are a woman, I would recommend you to be tested for cervical irregularities by a pelvic exam and Pap smear.Hope I helped with my answer.

I read carefully your query and I understand your concern.Epidermolysis bullosa is a inherited skin disease not a infection, it cause skin blister in response to minor injury, heat.The infection (bacterial infection) is one of the complications that happen when you have epidermolysis bullosa.You have a positive family history for this and from this you have a risk to have this disease depending on the type that your parents suffer.There are three type of this disease and they vary from them for their inherited way.Epidermolysis bulosa simplex, it is an autosomal dominant inheritance pattern. If one parent has the single faulty gene, you have a 50 percent chance of having the defect.Junctional epidermolysis bullosa, it is when both of your parents carry one copy of the defective gene and passed on the defective gene this is an autosomal recessive inheritance pattern. In this case if both parents carry one faulty gene, you have a 25 percent chance of developing the disorder.Dystrophic  epidermolysis bullosa. This type can be either dominant or recessive.To diagnose which of them has your mother and to know if you have this disease you should have a biopsy skin and a genetic consultation.

Because Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs may exacerbate dermatitis herpetiformis hence Dapsone is preferred.The anti inflammatory action is thought to be due to inhibition of neutrophil migration and function.In case if you been diagnosed to have Dermatitis herpetiformis, it is not an infectious disease caused by either virus or bacteria. It occurs in people with Coeliac disease, which is an allergy or intolerance to Gluten. Gluten is a protein found in wheat, rye, barley, and oats.

What type of probiotic should I take for my yeast infection...which was caused from the antibiotics?Today I bought produra 10 billion bacillus coagulans...walgreens brand probiotic pro gels is this safe for implantation","Doctor":"Hello Madam,Welcome to Health Care Magic. I read carefully your query and I understand your concern.We usually think of bacteria as something that causes diseases, but human body is full of bacteria, both good and bad. Probiotics are often called \\"good\\" or \\"helpful\\" bacteria because they help keep your gut healthy. Yeast infections often follow a dose of antibiotics, since in addition killing the bacteria that's making you sick, the medicine also kills bacteria that are normally found in your body, and leading to the overgrowth of the yeast.Regarding your implantation, the usage of probiotics doesn't cause any problem, on the contrary. You can use safely the product you bought.Hope I helped with my answer.

I read your query and I understand your concern.Cytomegalovirus (CMV) is a common virus that can infect almost anyone. Actually, most people don't know they have CMV because it rarely causes symptoms. However, if you are planing to get pregnant or have a weakened immune system, CMV is cause for concern.Once infected with CMV, your body retains the virus for life. You do not mention any symptom, except the test report results. However, need treatment when they're having symptoms of CMV infection, such as pneumonia. The kind of treatment depends on the symptoms and their severity.If treatment is needed, it's most often in the form of antiviral drugs. Antiviral drugs slow the virus reproduction, but can't cure it.

I read carefully your query and I understand your concern.You do not have to worry about, as long as your child is acting normally and drinking and eating enough. The condition you are describing is benign. Normally, the brown color of the stool is made by a substance called bilirubin. When stool passes through the intestines rapidly as is your sons case, diarrhea, there may be little time for bilirubin to undergo its usual chemical changes. Thus, stool can appear green in appearance due to rapid transit. Mild diarrhea usually passes within a few days and kids recover completely with care at home, rest, and plenty of fluids.Hope I have answered your question, if you have doubt then I will be happy to answer.

You need to clean the bite site with mild soap and water. If the bite is on an arm or leg, keep it elevated. You can take Motrin to get relief from pain and inflammation.   A tetanus booster shot is indicated if you haven't had one in the last five years. Observe the area for infection. Antibiotics may be required if the bite becomes infected.

Lymph node swelling in the neck is indicative of most commonly infection. HIV infection per say does not cause lymph node enlargement directly. It will decrease the immunity and thus gives a chance for secondary infection to happen. To know the reason behind your lymph node swelling, you can get Fine Needle Aspiration Cytology (FNAC) investigation done. That will tell you about the cause of the enlargement. Mainly, infection due to tuberculosis needs to be ruled out. Also, to be sure of your HIV status, since you are sexual activity, get your blood tested for HIV.

It is not (at this time) inflamed.. Its just a 'bump' with no redness at all. My primary physician gave me a script to see a plastic surgeon (considering its on my face), however, Im wondering if I should see a dermatologist first. My concern is, that although a plastic surgeon is good at 'surgery'...are they competent to treat a 'cyst' on a face...Any thoughts??","Doctor":"Hi, Thanks for posting in HCM.Well, sebaceous cyst on forehead needs removal, as if it gets infected, then it may cause disfigurement. What your primary physician has advised is right. You need to visit Plastic Surgeon for its removal. That is because, it needs excision, which is a surgical procedure, to be done under local anesthesia under aseptic precautions. Also, Plastic surgeon will perform the operation in such a way that there would be minimal scar after removal, considering cosmetic reasons.Hope the information provided would be useful for you."},{"Patient":"I have a red, raw line along the whole under-fold of my breast.

I read carefully your query and I understand your concerns.The condition you are describing is called \\"intertrigo\\", which is characterised by a rash that shows up between the folds of skin.Being that you are already on steroids and anti-fungal medications, I would recommend you start an unguent with zinc oxide, which is used for relief of rash.For further prevention and for quicker relief of the actual condition i would recommend you to shower and dry off thoroughly each day and apply a drying powder. Keep your skin as dry and cool as you can, avoid wearing clothing and wear a bra with good support.Hope I answered to your question.

I sprayed the mattress with Lysol disinfectant and we didn t get bit for awhile I also washed blanket and sheets with hot water with bleach. Thank you, Evy Ross","Doctor":"Hi Evy Ross, Thanks for posting in HCM.Swelling and icthing at the site of insect bite is mainly due to allergic reaction. Tiny bugs on bed are usually bed bugs. You don't have to worry much and do the following:For swelling, you can take Paracetamol with ibuprofen combination. For itchiness, take an antihistamine like chlorpheniramine maleate or Cetrizine. You can also apply calamine lotion.It is good that you have washed blanket and sheets with hot water and bleach. You can also use organophosphorus based sprays which could kill and prevent these bugs.It might take 2-5 days for the area to heal.

Swelling and redness at the site of sting is mainly due to allergic reaction. You will not get blood poisoning by bee sting. So you don't have to worry. All you need to do is the following:  1. Remove the Stinger by scraping the area carefully by using tweezers to remove it. Don't pinch the stinger as it can inject more venom.2. Control Swelling by applying ice the area and keep elevated the part if it is on hand or leg.3. Treat SymptomsFor pain, you can take acetaminophen with ibuprofen combination.

I think it may take a little more care because my ears irritate me and I am coughing up phlem along with other mucus problems any suggestions?","Doctor":"Hello, greetings! Thanks for your query. As you have stated, certainly Burkholderia cepacia complex (BCC) infection is hard to eradicate as this bacteria is highly resistant to the conventional antibiotics. The Antibiotcs have to be used extremely cautiously. The most effective drug is bactrim, but it isn't used routinely used as it is has severe side efffects. I would recommend my patients a class of drug called tetracyclines but as this is a prescription drug, it will be available on the basis of a prescription from your local doctor and he can udjust the dose by measuring your body statistics. Your concern for passing phlegm may be pointing towards a respiratory tract infection, if you have been phlegm and mucus for more than 2 weeks, I suggest you get it tested for the possibility of Tuberculosuis."},{"Patient":"I have been having multiple yeast infections they come and go and i just tried over the counter medication. it did not work. i do take the HGC hormone and have been doing that about the same time the yeast infections began.

If I was your treating physician I would perform a vaginal swab culture and urine culture first of all to reach the confirm diagnosis and its type.....it may be either of three ( bacterial, fungal or trichomoniasis). then my treatment plan would be according to the culture reports. As you have mentioned that you have already taken treatment for vaginitis, i would suggest that you now consult your gynaecologist for further treatment as excessive use of all drugs will make the causative organism resisitant which will make it even harder to cure.The treatment for recurrent infection may require medicines for a longer period of time.Meanwhile take extra care of hygiene of genital area, wear cotton undergarments and frequents changing of tampons.I hope this answers your question.

First of all, 37.5 degree Celsius temperature is within normal range for an adult. So there is nothing to worry about it. Your temperature is in control.

Please help","Doctor":"Hi & Welcome to HCM.I appreciate your concern for the recurrent thread worm infection.As such there is documented evidence of these worms developing resistance, it is likely that either you have not taken the taken properly or strict hygiene measures not being followed.The treatment involves two doses of Mebendazole or Albendazole with the second dose being given 2 weeks after the first dose. All your family members and other close contacts should be treated at the same time. Because itching and scratching of the anal area is common in thread worm infection, reinfection can occur easily so good hand hygiene is essential which can be achieved by the following measures:1. Appropriate handwashing (particularly before eating or handling food, after using the toilet, and after changing a diaper)2. Keeping the fingernails clean and short3. Avoiding fingernail-biting4. Avoiding scratching the skin around the anus5. Daily morning bathing removes a large proportion of eggs; showering may be preferred to avoid possible contamination of bath water. 6.

The possibility that you may be infected with Herpes Simplex Virus (HSV) is very high. You also mentioned that you had also a little fissure on your anus, and it could also be the site of entering various bacteria and infect you. In order to give a definite diagnose, you have to visit your local physician, who may order cultures (blood, tissue, and fluid samples) of the sores and send them to a laboratory for examination. Your doctor can typically diagnose a herpes infection by a visual examination of the herpes sores. Although they are not always necessary, your doctor may confirm his or her diagnosis through a laboratory test.Genital herpes is not the only condition that can produce these symptoms.

I suggest you to please see a doctor if his views are same and if can he prescribe these drugs for you.Steaming is not necessary at this point of time.Of course, you can drink lots of water approx 3l/day to maintain adequate  hydration nad hasten healing.All the above measures are absolutely enough.Post your further queries if any.Thank you."},{"Patient":"Hi, my daughter is 4 years of age and has been treated for scalp ringworm5-6 times.

She may transmit CMV to the growing fetus through blood and tissue products. A non reactive cytomegalovirus (CMV) IgM results suggest that the patient is not experiencing a recent infection. However, a negative result does not rule out primary CMV infection.The CMV IgM and IgG results should not be used alone to diagnose CMV infection. Results should be considered in conjunction with her clinical presentation & history and other laboratory findings.  In cases of suspected disease, the testing should be repeated in 10 to 14 days.Hope to have answered your query."},{"Patient":"I was playing paintball yesterday and doing superman slides.

So, you need to take at least 4 intrarmuscular injections on days 0, 3, 7, & 14 into the deltoid muscle.Along with inj tetanus toxoid (which you have already taken) a thorough washing of the wound with soap/detergent and water, followed by the application of ethanol or an aqueous solution of iodine or povidone should also be done.Hope to have answered your query.Best wishes."},{"Patient":"I am 52 years and was diagnosed on Tuesday with Shingles.

I  have been having a health problem that I can't seem to get resolved by any of the doctors I have seen. About a year and a half ago, I have been extremely gaseous.  It feels like I have suppressed gas trapped in my chest and I am constantly burping or trying to burp to relieve it.  However, as soon as I do so, the suppress gas returns.  I am gaseous at both ends.  I never had my tonsils out and I also notice that when I get run down, I have swollen lymph nodes in my throat and my voice gets hoarse.  I have been to an ENT doctor and they told me that I do not have a deviated septum even though I sleep with my mouth open.  I also am now seeing a gastroenterologist and they said it is not reflux etc.  Do you think my sinuses are causing me all of my problems?","Doctor":"Hii,you said you have had gaseous feeling since one and half years, from what i understand it can be gastritis or acid reflux both of which can be relieved by taking antacids. If I were your treating doctor, i would have suggested you tab.Omez 20mg or tab. Pantop 40mg once daily on empty stomach. if these doesnt relieve the symptoms, combination of an antacid with mucain gel is better in relieving gastritis. Avoiding spicy foods and having proper meals at regular intervels can greatly decrease the gaseous feeling.Lymph node swelling usually can occur in minor bacterial or viral infections of throat even though there is no septal deviation. Sinusitis (infection of sinuses) also causes lymph nodal swelling sometimes. I would suggest you to get an Xray of para nasal sinuses which gives a clear picture if the problem is with sinuses. These conditions can be treated with taking antibiotics like amoxicillin 500mg twice daily when u have episodes of swelling.

I understand your concern.Even though I am not near your local area, let me help you by answering to your questions. Lyme disease is an infectious disease caused by the bacteria Borrelia burgdorferi and transmitted by ticks. An important early sign of Lyme disease is a red skin rash called erythema migrans, or also known as \\"bull's eye\\",  which typically occurs 3-30 days after the bite of an infected tick. Flu-like symptoms, extreme tiredness and headache occur and if left untreated the disease may spread throughout the body to the nervous system, joints, skin, heart and eyes, causing a range of symptoms like for example Facial palsy and nerve root pain.Treatment of Lyme disease is with antibiotics and the sooner this is started, the greater the chance of a good recovery. If I were your treating doctor I would prescribe you Doxycycline 100 mg PO twice a day, for 14-21 days, unless you are allergic to it.Since this is a prescription medicine, I would suggest you to meet the local Doctor to confirm the diagnosis.Hope I answered to your question.Tace Care,Dr. Ina Zaimi"},{"Patient":"Ive had what i thought were mosquito bites on my legs, maybe 10 of them?

They itch intensely.","Doctor":"Dear- thanks for using our service.You are having an allergic reaction to the mosquito bites, giving you the itchy bumps from it. It might take 3-4 days to get better,try not to scratch too much to avoid openings in the area that can create an infection. You can use tripple antibiotic cream and calamine lotion for the itching. You can use benadryl 25 mg every 6-8 hours for the itching too.I hope that my advise has been helpfulDR.JC"},{"Patient":"I woke up and on the inside of my left inner thigh where the crease meets the pelvic area I found a huge hard sorta oblong feeling and it feels hard as a rock but hurts little when you push in it. what the heck could it be. its not a lump outwards its a lump like if you were to do a breast check.","Doctor":"Hi, thanks for using healthcare magicThe 'bump' may be a lymph node that is inflamed or infected or abscess which is a collection of pus. An abscess is initially hard/firm then softens as pus is formed.Lumps can also form if there is trauma to an area.Your doctor can determine which is present based on the exact location.Antibiotics may be needed if an infection is present.I hope this helps"},{"Patient":"My clitoris sometimes gets red, swollen, and super itchy.

Magnacef 500 belongs to Cephalosporin group of antibiotics. If any infection is recurring, then you need to go for change in the antibiotics.

Any clues?","Doctor":"HI, thanks for using healthcare magicIt can take a few days for diarrhea to resolve completely. If you are still having symptoms, it would be best to avoid solid food till your intestines are ready to absorb food.The use of food when they are not ready would just cause abdominal cramping and cause it to be passed out.When there is a 4 hour window with no symptoms, small amounts of dry foods can be restarted.You can try using probiotics, these help diarrhea to resolve because they restore the normal vaginal flora.Meds such as peptobismol or lomotil may also help you.I hope this helps"},{"Patient":"I am almost 30 yrs old and weigh about 155.

If I were your treating doctor I would recommend you not take the Ecstasy, due to the possible dangerous side effects.

Your immunity, due to mono infection is really low.

She was diagnosed with C-diff and died a few days later from that.  In her lifetime she did seem to use antibiotics alot for her chronic emphysema and probably the last six months or so complained of diarrhea.  My question is could she have had c-diff before she went into the hospital?  In the past two years she probably lost  30-40 lbs and lost her appetite.  She did eat but got very picky about what she would eat.  Her primary care doctor always did bloodwork on her and it always came back normal.  She also had alot of chest xrays that came out ok.  I was also wondering if she could have had some sort of cancer?  I have gone on numerous websites and could not find how long you can have C-diff and live with it without treatment.  She was also put on 3 liters of o2 the last 6 months of her life since her stats were in the 80's.  I guess I am also wondering about her rapid decline.  she was a heavy smoker all her life but she was so healthy and did alot up until about 2 years ago.  She would not leave the house and seemed very depressed.  She also had been diagnosed schiziophrenia in her 20's and was always on medication for that - she was on prolixim by injection every two weeks for  probably the last 10 or so years and was doing very well.","Doctor":"Well Hello der,                    Reading about your mother I understand she had alot of pre-existing problems which left her body very weak.As her age is not mentioned here , I'm assuming she must be an elderly lady. I'm really sorry for your loss and i know that there may be a thousand questions racing through your mind.              Lets look at them systematically. She was a diagnosed schizophrenic from an early age and on treatment which has its own long term side effects . A necessary evil cos schizophrenia should be treated and its a long term thing so side effects could not be avoided.She was a heavy smoker which affected her lungs and heart leading to development of heart failure and COPD which are themselves life threatening when present as independent entities in any patient . They were both present at the same time in your mother's case .One need not have a cancer. These two themselves are fatal problems leading to rapid decline in ones health . COPD is the condition where the lungs are damaged mostly due to smoking as was in this case and are not able to meet the needs of the body resulting in frequent infections and also cardiac failure.Smoking in itself is a major cause of heart failure as it causes degenerative changes in the heart and blood vessels.Your mother was already suffering from two life threatening conditions and this along with the C-diff diarrhea proved fatal. Diarrhea in itself if not treated promptly proves fatal. So in this case we are seeing three independently  life threatening conditions coming together unfortunately, proving fatal in the end.So attributing your mothers death only to the C-diff diarrhea would not be appropriate . Hope you got your answers.Take care."},{"Patient":"So I made a really stupid decision 2 days ago and I let someone brand me...

The area is kind of swollen but it doesn t really hurt that bad when I put pressure on it. Twice a day I clean it with soap and water and then clean it out with hydrogen peroxide, then I put this hospital antiseptic solution (povidone iodine) on it, which is like a film, and then finally cover it with a band aid.

Currently you are keeping good hygiene of your wound. My advice is don't wash your wound with Hydrogen peroxide as it is usually used to remove dirt and dust from the injured wound and not in burn cases. Secondly apply some antibiotic+antifungal ointment like Betnovate C on the wound. Do not apply bandage on the burn area, keep it open after applying antiseptic cream.Take tab Aceclofenac twice daily for 5 days for pain, tab famotidine twice daily for 5 days."},{"Patient":"Hello. 42 yr old female.

Oozing clear fluid if I press (looked to see if any small part behind and cannot see anything though hard when swollen (and on left hand which is my strong hand so needle wobbles!!!)","Doctor":"Hi there and thank you for your question.I appreciate your concern here and I shall try and help where I can.Bramble thorns break off quite easily and can lodge under the skin due to their size and sharpness. The issue though is that the tips of the thorns tend to break off and embed themselves under the skin.In effect, the body regards this splinter as a foreign body under the skin and an inflammatory reaction occurs. Blood rushes to the site of the wound in order to get white cells in the area so as to try and destroy the foreign body. That is why the finger would swell and become red and tender.The swelling then came down as you removed the splinter and the healing process can continue without there being a foreign body in the way to complicate matters. The clear fluid would be plasma that escapes which was formed as part of the initial foreign body reaction.You can continue applying the antiseptic cream for a couple more days just to help prevent an infection from occurring. The issue should then resolve on its own with the swelling decreasing on a daily basis.If the swelling, tenderness and redness starts to worsen then I would suggest seeing your doctor to assess the situation. Either there's then a secondary infection or there still is a foreign body stuck at the site of the wound.I hope this helps and good luck."},{"Patient":"I have been monitoring my BP at home and have found my left arm usually 10 - 20 degrees higher than my right...ie last evening 179/100 left  145/97 in the right...last week it showed in my left arm 198/120 with a pulse of 122 (I did speak with my doctor - and was diagnoised with a sinus infection","Doctor":"Hi there and thank you for your question.I can appreciate that you may have a sinus infection if you complained of symptoms relating to this issue, but I highly doubt that this is what's causing your blood pressure to be so high.I would like to suggest that you physically consult with your doctor as your blood pressure is very high and seems to be persistent seeing that in the period of one week you had such high readings.It would be advisable to have this issue managed as soon as possible as complications such as stroke, cardiac failure and kidney related issues can arise from uncontrolled high blood pressures.It would also be wise to have both arms checked to see if there is a genuine difference between the pressures on both sides.

The medication can be found in a pill, pessary or ointment form and the duration of treatment can last 1, 3, 7 or even 10 days.Therefore, there can be quite a bit of failed treatment protocols as well as a lot of confusion that can occur.The medication that I have previously prescribed for my patients that works very well is a single dose of fenticonazole 600mg pessary that is inserted in the vagina and the infection usually clears up after the third day.You can speak to your pharmacist about supplying this specific medication for you and see how you respond.If this also fails then I would suggest seeing your doctor to exclude other issues such as a secondary or superimposed infection with this current one.I hope this helps though and good luck."},{"Patient":"After giving that stuff a try I too also felt like my heart was going to beat right out of my chest, but when i woke up the next morning i noticed swelling in multiple lymph nodes.

The prescribed regimen by your treating doctor is INCOMPLETE as it contains only the  \\"sequentially used\\" antibiotics (Mox, Tiniba & Clarinova).Notable missing drug here is a proton pump inhibitor like Omeprazole or Pantoprazole which should have also be taken simultaneously.2. Proton pump inhibitor should be continued for another 4-6 weeks for total eradication of the H.pylori and the healing of the stomach ulcer.Had you been my patient I would have advised the following \\"Triple Therapy\\" which is found to be more efficacious:1. Two antibiotics (Mox to be taken twice and Tiniba to be taken twice) along with a PPI like Pantoprazole  for 14 days, this is followed by2.

Also I do not know if the dog has had its shots but I doubt it. Do I need to get a rabies shot?","Doctor":"Hi,I went through your concern.I presume the scratch was with its paws and not the teeth. If there is no possibility of the dogs saliva to mix with your bleeding wound then no need for rabies vaccine whether the dog is immunised or not. Rabies spread through contact with dog saliva. And I also presume that your bleeding is not in your cornea of the eye but your conjunctiva. Cornea any damage could result in immediate loss of vision and if that was so you would have already rushed to the ER. bleeding under conjunctiva will automatically settle within 2-3 weeks. However now, you have to get a tetanus vaccination and a topical antibiotic cream like neosporin or mupirocin over the scratch mar will help in healing. Bleeding can be controlled by applying direct pressure for 5-10 mins till bleeding stops.Regards"},{"Patient":"Hi, I ve had an infection in both my ear piercings (did them myself ;-;) and well I ignored it, but eventually I was put on antibiotics but I stopped using them because I forgot bout it, while my ears were still infected i began stretching my ears, after a while my earlobes look terrible and I was wondering what I could do besides sea salt soaks or doctor visits.","Doctor":"Hi Dear,Understanding your concern. As per your query you have symptoms of infection in ear piercings and infection keeps on reoccurring is mainly due to irritation by the ear ring or sticking up with clothes or fingers there might be having minor injuries causing infection. Some times during piercing the instruments used are not clean enough or not sterilize which causes infection and leads to formation of pus and pain as well. Conditions should be highly septic and instrument should be adequately sharp otherwise there will be minor skin trauma which leads to infection. I would suggest you to :-- Take advil or tylenol for pain.- Apply ' Fluicidic acid ' cream to treat infection .- Clean it properly .Consult doctor for proper examination .Doctor may prescribe antibiotic course for 7-10 days. If antibiotic is not working then remove ear ring for few days and re apply after healing the wound.Hope your concern has been resolved.Best Wishes,Dr. Harry Maheshwari"},{"Patient":"Hi, I have a sore very lumpy area around +my right nipple area.

If there is not high titer (above 1:160) here in widal test then this need to give antibiotics in single dosage for at least 15 days and follow up is taken after repeating widal test again.The main concern is not only treatment but to prevent relapse and to prevent carrier state is also important.So,better you take treatment from physician only rather than taking from any other doctor or by self.Initially only liquid diet for 5 days then if response is good, then you can go for soft diet till the completion of treatment as diet is also a important factor during treatment.This combination of dietary and medications will cure you completely in proper duration as i have mentioned.Regards,"},{"Patient":"i am receiving epidural injections in my neck, after my third injection i have symptoms of a yeast infection, I am prone to yeast infections when taking antibotics, since i have not been on any antibotics is it possible it could be from the epidural injections??","Doctor":"Hello,Yes it could be from the injections. We all have yeast on our skin all the time. When we take an antibiotic it can kill off the bacteria that keep the yeast in check. When you take a steroid or get a steroid injection it suppresses the immune system and can also result in yeast infections. Seek treatment for the yeast infection early as they are much easier to treat if treatment is begun earlyRegards,Dr. Robinson"},{"Patient":"Hello, I've been really sick with Typhod, Malta, & Rematic Fevers all at the same time.

What is her life expectancy if the dry grangrene is left untreated?","Doctor":"Hi, sorry to note about the condition your mother is suffering from. Gangrene is a potentially life-threatening condition caused by a critically insufficient blood supply causing tissue necrosis. Dry gangrene is a form of coagulative necrosis that develops where the blood supply is inadequate to keep tissue viable. But since the dead tissue is more viable for infection, it is difficult to predict about the life expectancy.Once the infection sets in locally and starts spreading inside the body (septicemia), then they land up in one by once complication of multi-organ failure."},{"Patient":"I had oral herpes 9 months ago which was not treated properly .

After the first infection, the virus becomes dormant in the nerve tissues in the face. Sometimes, the virus later reactivates, causing neuralgia like condition. I would suggest you to oral pathologist as well as a neurologist for proper treatment. The doctor may order a viral culture test, viral DNA test, and Tzanck test to confirm the diagnosis. The doctor may prescribe antiviral drugs like Acyclovir, Famciclovir, or Valacyclovir at least for two weeks along with anti-inflammatory drugs to treat the nerve condition.

It fills up with fluid and then it pops and this pattern has continued for weeks. It only, recently, dawned on me that it all started when i started up with these daily shakes. Any possible connection between the two...(I'm 51, 5'7, 125 pounds, not on any meds) thanks...","Doctor":"Hi dear,The mucus cyst can occur due to various reason like biting , accidental rupture of salivary gland , adjacent teeth causing chronic damage or cheek biting . It has no connection with shakes . Treatment is based upon the severity of the mucous cyst. Sometimes cysts may not require treatment and will heal on their own over time. Superficial cysts heal in very short times . But there are other treatment options available for severe cysts like laser therapy , cryotherapy and intralesional corticosteroid injection . So i would suggest you to consult oral surgeon for proper treatment . D octor may use a scalpel or laser to remove the salivary gland. Local anesthesia numbs the pain. Marsupialization is also one of the treatment option.

From your description of the situation I suspect you are having fear or phobia of intercourse. I understand that in 2010 you suffered a lot. But that thing happens rarely. So don't feel that you will have herpes every time you have sexual intercourse with your partner. Transmission of STI is simply prevented by use of condom during intercourse. Avoid having unprotected intercourse with multiple partner. Sexual intercourse is itself an exercise beneficial to your body. So there is nothing wrong in it. Enjoy your sexual life without any fear.

Isolated red spot without any signs and symptoms is not serious. Your child is also normal and playing so dont worry.As suggested by you the spot is on the back of knee, so possibly its in the Knee folds. Continues moisture is present due to sweating.

But if your skin has some injury or abrasion or it is not intact, this can transmit infection. To make you infect, the blood with which you came in contact should harbour some kind of infection.

Avoid sharing clothing with anybody else.I hope this answers your question. Please feel free to contact HCM again if you have any concerns.Wishing you good health."},{"Patient":"I have extreme fatigue, full body aches (dull, head to toe), heat intolerance GA (I do live in southeast GA) sometimes I HAVE to sleep on my stomach because sides and back hurt. all blood work including thyroid comes back perfect.

He had an EKG today & was told that he had an rsr variation & referred to a cardiologist. Of note, my son also has a history of boderline high BP, today it was 80/138. (not white coat syndrome as it is elevated when I take it at home)  I first noticed his BP seemed rather high when he was about 8 years old. About the same time I also noticed a 'skip' in his heartbeat; about every 3rd beat, but not all the time. This had gone unnoticed until then.  (I was in nursing school at the time of this discovering)He is 5' 11\\" & weigths 153 lbs.  (Side note: I learned today that 2 1/2 months ago he weighted 176; 23 lb wt. lose.  He seemed unaware that he had lost so much wt & attributes the wt lose to DCing soda & starting to exercise) Also, about 1 1/2 years ago he was seen by a different PCP for vertigo/dizziness. At that time he was DX with an inner ear infection & was given Meclozine (sp).  The docotor's DX was based on my son's eye movement; my son's eyes 'fluttered' when he was asked to follow the doctor's finger with his eyes.  As of recent the Meclazine (sp)  does not help with his vertigo/dizziness. What dose rsr variation mean? Does this warrant a visit to the cardiologist?  Thank you","Doctor":"Sir, rsr variation is seen in ECG and is frequently seen in healthy people. You can treat his ear infection with Azithal 500 mg once daily for 5 days along with cetrizine.

There are many strains of HPV and some of them cause warts and some do not. The strains of HPV that causes cervical cancer are not the same strains that cause warts. You can ask your doctor to do an HPV test to look specifically for all strains of HPV. You can also ask that the warts be biopsied and sent to pathology to make sure they are really warts.

They ran several heart related blood tests, and EKGs, nothing showed other than attendants noticed the pulse stopping on occassion which finally stopped, her blood pressure was high but they brought that under control.She was relaesed about 5 hours later with advice to follow up with her cardiologist. She felt uncomfortable, had similar symptoms until we saw the doctor two days later. He rana series of blood tests, EKGs, echo grams and stress test - all showing nothing out of the ordinary. he suggetsed a general doctor - which we saw. Meanwhile, she began to be nauseous, no desire to eat and with upset stomach when she tried to eat something. Several blood tests and urine tests were run with nothing showing but a very high B12 - she had been taking vitamin supplements and stopped that, Subsequently, she began to have muslce spasm for short periods in the arms, buttocks area, and a few in the legs. She couldn t eat much at all, unable to sleep comforatble but for short periods at a time.

However a third opinion whom is a specialist said that it's just mild asthma and right now I'm under 50/500 steroid accuhaler. Unfortunately, after a few months of stopping coughing, I've got a cold and flu. Then, the cough started again. Right now, when I cough, my lungs feel uncomfortable and while breathing, I feel some kind of vibration. This worries me alot because I've never experienced such before. So am I getting worse now? Are my lungs flooded? What am I having actually? Bronchitis or mild asthma? Should I be concerned?Confused.","Doctor":"Hello madam/sir, welcome to medical care magic.Dont worry. In bronchitis, it gets irritated and starts secreting more mucus. The tube narrows. so to bring out secretion, there will be cough and narrowing of these bronchus which causes difficulty in breathing. Severity of these narrowing almost like spasms is asthma. I hope now you understand what is happening.Severe coughing causes vibration like feeling. You said you had flu which again sensitizes the bronchus. So continue steroid inhaler till you are relieved of breathing difficulty. Definetely avoid dust exposure, steam inhalation -3 to 4 times per day. when you are comfortable start doing breathing exercises which strengthens the walls.With this I hope I cleared your doubts. Any further doubts you are always welcome. Take care. Good health"},{"Patient":"I have a 16 year old daughter that has been having sinus tachycardia with symptoms of chest pain, dizziness, and heart rate up to 200.

In your case, you have had for 5 weeks a cough (and possibly cold) that may be caused by any infection of your upper or lower respiratory tract. Such time is enough for the body to have a lower immunity and other opportunist infections.

He has sore throat, tender to touch stomach pain and upper leg pain. I have been continually giving him ibuprofen 10ml and paracetamol 10ml every 4 hourly. His heart is racing continually but I guess this is due to fighting infection. I make sure he is not covered up to help fever lower but doesn t last for long.

Mum","Doctor":"HI, thanks for using healthcare magicThe fever due to a cough and cold can potentially lasts at least 3 to 4 days.The paracetamol can be every 4 hours, as you are using but you need to space the ibuprofen to at least every 6 to 8 hours.Keeping cool and using cool liquids would also help along with tepid sponging or baths.The use of an oral spray or gargle may help to reduce the pain in the throat eg covonia, chloroseptic but if you are concerned that he is not improving then you can take him back to his doctor for reassessment.I hope this helps"},{"Patient":"Hi, may I answer your health queries right now ?

It should resolve within a few days.I hope this helps"},{"Patient":"I have had recent swollen lymph nodes in my arm pit monthly the week before and during my menstrual cycle.

I have carefully worked through your case, and can well realize your health worries. Being your physician, I want to assure, I will take care all of your medical concerns.No, it is not lyme disease. She had got a problem with the pregnancy and couldn't keep it up. So miscarriage was the result. Sometimes products of conception remains inside as was with her, that get infected and cause serious to life threatening consequences. Infection sometimes spread to blood stream too and pose a risk even to mother's life.She did  very well that she got D & C. Now she will get better day by day.Lyme disease is due to a tick bite, from outside in vacations or from any endemic area. It causes rash on bite site first of all, then may lead to neurological manifestations like bell's palsy etc. It is an altogether a different disease.Your daughter was ill due o retained products of conception and is out of danger now. Give her plenty of fresh fruit juices and vegetables, meat and salads. Keep her active physically. She will  be alright now.Hope I answered all of your questions.

We controlled it by alternating advil and tylenol every 3 hours and that was for 4 days.  We took him to the Dr. on Sunday and they confirmed strep throat.  The only real symptom has been this high fever, and he hasn't complained about anything else.  He did vomit once and it was greenish/yellowish and looked like mucus.  He is now on Amoxicillin for 10 days, and my big concern is that his fever is not going away.  It has been spiking in early evening and early morning as high as 103, so we've still been giving Advil/tylenol.  what do you think?  could there be a secondary infection or complications because we let it go for several days before treatment?","Doctor":"Hi, after going through the medical history I feel that the infection is resistant to Amoxicillin. Usually fever subsides within 1 or 2 days of antibiotic therapy. Unless the bacteria is resistant, it is not possible for the fever to be going on till now. The other possibility is that an entire diagnosis has been missed altogether. Why I say this because, Strept can also be cultured from healthy people who are called as carriers and they do not have symptoms because of this. Therefore it may be co-incidental that we identified this carrier state when he might be actually down with something else. (This is not a common scenario when compared to encountering an antibiotic resistance). So next spike of fever, Kindly take your son to ER and it is better to get him admitted in the hospital, do blood and urine test and cultures and treat accordingly after ruling out other infectionsRegards"},{"Patient":"My husband and I have been together for 14yrs.

One year ago he was hospitalized for A-fib. This past October, 2016, he had an M.I and 2 stents were put it. He had an Eco last week and as a result is ejection fraction numbers now put him in the range for congestive heart failure . This week he has a Pet scan stress test. Options such as an implanted defribrillator and or a pace maker are now being discussed as next steps.Any information etc. is very welcomed.","Doctor":"Hello and Welcome to ‘Ask A Doctor’ service. I have reviewed your query and here is my advice. Generally, in patients with low ejection fraction, cause of death in many patients is ventricular arrhythmias, so putting ICD will revert this with the help of shock and restoring normal rhythm. Also, if heart failure is refractory in the form of persistent symptoms like shortness of breath, etc., then these patients may be helped with CRT which synchronizes the chambers of the heart. Both these devices may be combined in a single device called as CRTD. So let me know his echo report and medicines which he is having at present. He should be on antiplatelets like Aspirin, statin like Atorvastatin or Rosuvastatin, beta blockers like Metoprolol and ace inhibitors like Ramipril along with Spironolactone. Hope this helps you and get back if you have any doubts."},{"Patient":"I was bit by a medium sized dog about 12 days ago.

I have reviewed your query and here is my advice. Most probably these are ventricular premature complexes or even may be atrial ectopics which may be a precursor of a fib. These are ectopic or extra beats. These are usually benign and not life threatening. These are frequently associated with MVP, also caffeine, alcohol, thyroid problems may aggravate these. So before going ahead we need to confirm it. Since these are not frequent ECG may be normal, so in that case you ll need 24 Holter monitoring which can diagnose these. You should also get thyroid test done. You ll need beta blockers like Metoprolol to keep these under control.

The bacteria usually attack the lungs.TB is spread through the air from one person to another. The TB bacteria are put into the air when a person with TB disease of the lungs or throat coughs, sneezes, or speaks.TB bacteria get into the air and can remain there for SEVERAL HOURS. People at highest risk of becoming infected are close contacts - those individuals who have prolonged, frequent, or intense contact with a person with infectious tuberculosis. They may breathe in these bacteria and become infected. The most important way to stop the spread of tuberculosis is for patients who have active TB to cover their mouth and nose when coughing, and to take all the TB medicine exactly as ordered by the doctor.Beside all the close contacts should be given the anti TB drug Isoniazide once daily for at least 6 months to prevent the disease.Hope this could answer your query."},{"Patient":"Dear doctor, so on 29thof july around 9am i went to a gompa (tibetan temple) for blessing and when i was bending for blessing from the rinpoche, his dog who was sitting right off his foot looked over at me BARKED and started attacking me, the dog couldnt bit me first as i was running but then he got me and bit me on my thigh, the the area where he bit looks blueish-red.

When a person with active TB sneezes, coughs, or talks closely to others, bacteria are passed through tiny drops of fluid from the mouth and nose that are unknowingly breathed in by others. Kissing or having physical relations with your husband will not transmit the disease. However, all the close contacts including your husband should be screened for active TB and if found positive should be given the treatment.TB only cause infertility when it involves the fallopian tubes.It is a treatable condition, you must avoid drugs like Streptomycin and Pyrazinamide during pregnancy as these anti TB drugs can produce harmful effects in the growing fetus.

Your problem can be due to ringworm ( Tinea corporis). If you send a picture then it will be more helpful in identifying. Clotrimazole won't be effective for some.

My normally low blood pressure (110/60) was running a bit high for a couple of months (135/88 and up to 145/90). I went to my cardiologist, BP was 145/88, hence he started prescription. I picked up prescription the following day, checked BP prior to taking pill..bp was 118/70...I had an appointment with GP later in the morning and bp was still 117/70 so I asked if I needed bp meds. She advised to start Lisinopril as bp fluctuates. I took one and the following morning, my bp was 90/68. It remained under 120 the entire day. Should I not take the pill, take full dosage or cut it in half or should I wait to see what bp does over the rest of the weekend and follow up with cardiologist on Monday?","Doctor":"Hello and Welcome to ‘Ask A Doctor’ service. I have reviewed your query and here is my advice. Do you have any other problems other than hypertension for which it was prescribed. If no, then I don't think you need BP medicines.

The swelling of her hands and legs is either due to the allergy or other organs like heart/kidney affected by the fever itself.

Within one month the lower limb was infected and he is now in the hospital after they did an above the knee amputation.  I have a couple of questions.  First, the surgery was done this past Monday late afternoon and when I left today which is three days later he still did not have any bandages or wrappings covering the incision/staples and a small open area for drainage of blood.  After the first amputation the doctor had specific wound care orders which was dry dressing to be checked every day and changed every day.  This time...the doctor signed off the case within 24 hours and left no wound care instructions.  I have been asking the nursing staff, the hospitalists, etc. why the limb is not covered and today my answer from two doctors and a wound care nurse is that it is better for it to be free from dressings and just be open air.  I told them I didn't agree and that did not go over well and was told when I receive a medical degree or nursing degree then I could voice my opinion.  I am extremely concerned about infection as his first amputation was infected and is still on IV antiobiotics for treatment of the infection.  He has had periperal vascular disease for 15 years and the amputated limb has an old graft that took three angioplastys to open the blockage for the first amputation.  My husband has had a Urinary Tract infection since the first amputation up to today.  They had to drain his bladder twice because the readings were showing urine retention in the 700 range.  I mention this because one of the doctors who is refusing to bandage his upper limb says if the urine should get in his open new wound it could not cause an infection?  I also questioned dirty sheets being placed on top of the wound, my husband touching the wound with dirty hands and just plain old germs that are everywhere in the hospital.  Isn't a Urinary Tract Infection mean there is bacteria in the urine.  Because he has had this UT Infection he has been using a urinal and it spills all the time.  The would and open incision are very close to his penis and the urinal is touching his limb all the time.  Should I be worried about infection without this wound/staples being bandaged and the fact the urine is getting on the open wound area.  The lower limb was so badly infected that it had turned black and their was no choice but to amputate higher.  Shouldn't the doctors/nurses be more concerned about infection setting in this new amputation would or am I just worrying needlessly?  Please reply as soon as possible as this is really stressing me by worrying about him and his care he is receiving.  Thank you so much in advance for any help or answers.  Sincerely, a very concerned wife/caregiver.","Doctor":"Thanks for consulting. I have carefully worked through your case, and I can realize your health worries. Being your physician, I assure you not to worry as I will take care all of your medical concerns.your husband must have got the urinary tract infection when he was put tube for urine first time. following an amputation for an elderly person the chance of infection are high so that's why he was given an IV antibiotics. that too if he is having diabetes the chance of infection are even more high.kindly take care that by no way his urine comes in contact with the amputation wound. the mater of content is not that your husband having urinary tract infection. the normal urine itself is full of germs. hospital is the worst place to manage the amputated wound like this. hospitals is full of bad and strong germs. MRSA is a night mare and is common in hospitals. My advice will be you personally learn from the health professionals and get your self trained in cleaning the wound and you do it every day from your home. also it is better to keep the wound open rather than keeping it closed as the temperature inside a closed wound becomes favorable for germ to grow. in open wound the oxygen in air and cooler temperature becomes unfavorable for the germs to grow. but extra care must be take to keep the bed and bed sheets clean.keep a check on the sugar levels and keep it controlled in normal range.

And recently that went away but right after the inside of my lip has swelled a little and has red splotches on it. And my boyfriend just told me the inside of his lip feels rough like sandpaper. What is going on???","Doctor":"Hi Dear,Understanding your concern. As per your query you have  roughness inside lips with swelling which is nothing much to be worried about. Since you don't have any systemic symptoms like pain or fever till now it cannot be an infection. Eversion of lips leads to dehydration and feeling of chapping of lips. It can be due to some allergic condition either due to some food stuffs you had or some medication you are taking or can be due to deficiency of some vitamins. I would suggest you to maintain proper oral hygiene and drink plenty of water, rinse with warm salt water and be careful of diet to limit acidic foods.1) Brush two times a day along with flossing.2) Rinse with antimicrobial chlorhexidine mouthwash3) Have green leafy vegetables and fruits and take multivitamin tablet to combat vitamin deficiencies.4) Apply moisturizer on lips to prevent them from drying.Follow these instructions and wait for few days , your symptoms will go away and if still persists meet dentist or a dermatologist.

Probably you have developed  Canker sores which is causing you high grade fever as well  as uvula acts as a barrier to  swallow food and prevents bacteria and infections from entering the throat and digestive tract.I would suggest you to drink a glass of warm water with honey to reduce the swelling and prevent the spread of any infection. Do warm saline gargles. If the underlying cause of the condition is a viral or bacterial infection, the appropriate medication should be taken. Antibiotics will help get rid of a bacterial infection and over-the-counter painkillers or anti-inflammatory drugs may help with a viral infection.Chew two to three cloves of garlic to help reduce the infection and heal an enlarged uvula. Fresh onion juice is also an effective remedy.You symptoms will resolve in 3-5 days.

The basic problem here in your case is fever and subacute intestinal obstruction.. if u are passing flatus with faeces then continue withthe soft diet along with the antibiotics and sure you can take  ADVIL too. if u havent  passed stools  and flatus for more than 24 hours and if it accompanies abdominal distension then quickly consult your doctor so that proper workup can be done in time..                                            regards"},{"Patient":"Hi, I was recently diagnosed with herpes, not sure what type yet, but it seems to be a mild case as I dont have lesions, but my lips keep swelling everyday and nothing turns into cold sores, just two small bumps and swelling, along with tingling and tingling tip of tongue.

Swollen lip and submental lymphadenopathy or swelling can be due to infection outbreak only..I would suggest you to consult a Infectious disease specialist or a dermatologist and get evaluated..You will be prescribed with oral anti virals like Acyclovir and Famicyclovir for preventing further outbursts..Although the antivirals do not cure the current infection but it prevents the further outbreaks of the infection..Applying Abvera which is a topical antiviral ointment can help and should be continued..Avoid making intimate contact wit other individuals as it can cause them infection as well as use personal things like towels,utensils etc without sharing with others to prevent transmission of infection as it is a communicable disease..Hope this information helps..If you find the answer helpful kindly write a positive review and click on found this answer helpful as a token of appreciation..Thanks and regards..Dr.Honey Nandwani Arora."},{"Patient":"I have RX for pain: APAP/CODEINE TAB 300-30MG, and was told it is a combination of Tylenol and Codeine.

On doctor's advise I have gone thorough multiple blood tests also one ultrasonic test. All reports were negative except for Hepatitis B surface antigen. All those test were done in March 2011, in August again I gone for Hepatitis B surface antigen test and report says \\"Reactive\\". Do I need to take some precautions, medications etc. I am perfectly normal, I mean i don't have any symptoms. What should I do now. I am Pune so it will be great for me if you can suggest me a doctor in Pune.","Doctor":"Hello and welcome to HCM!To summarize it briefly: you are amongst those persons who, when contacting hepatitis B virus, cannot get rid of it. Almost 10-15% of all persons contacting hepatitis B virus can not eradicate it and become the so-called \\"a Hepatitis B carrier\\". There are two types of hepatitis B chronic carriers: active carrier and passive carrier. An active carrier is a person infected with hepatitis B and that shows signs and symptoms of the disease.  A passive carrier is a person who has the disease in its body but it doesn't manifest any signs and/or symptoms. Since you report that you did several test back in 2011, and you are feeling perfectly healthy, then I guess that you are a passive carrier of hepatitis B and probably you will continue to have this status for the rest of your life if you do not engage in excessive unhealthy behaviors such excessive alcohol intake, etc. Unfortunately, there is no ultimate cure for chronic B hepatitis. You can try with interferon therapy, but this is expensive and in a good proportion of cases it can only achieve a lowering of the titer of HBsAg surface antigen without eradicating it. On the other hand, treatment of hepatitis B with interferon or other anti-viral drugs is advised only if there are signs of liver damage but this is not your case. Vaccinating against hepatitis B at this stage is of little benefit as well, even though it is not harmful.However, please not that you can pass the infection to other people through unprotected sexual intercourse or if your blood comes in contact to that of other people. Therefore, you can not donate blood anymore. Therefore, my advice would be: do not engage in unhealthy behaviors such as excessive alcohol intake, in order to not \\"wake-up\\" the silent disease. If you are careful then you can live a perfectly healthy life. Lastly, carriers of hepatitis B need to measure the levels of liver enzymes such as ALT and AST periodically in order to monitor its function.I hope I have answered your concern!

Only 5mm and 10mm holes and you may  go home after some couple of hours.If we don't remove the stitch, it will cause rupture of the organ in which it is placed at the moment.

After finishing the amoxicillin I started to have bad earache so they then prescribed pseudoephedrine to unblock catarrh in my ears but it doesn't seem to be working and now all my previous symptoms have also come back. What is going on?","Doctor":"I read your question carefully and I understand your concern. First of all, if you had just flu like symptoms, it is usually a viral infection (not a bacterial one) and antibiotic treatment is not effective and not recommended. I believe with flu like symptoms you mean runny or stuffy nose, cough and/or sore throat, headaches and/or body aches, fever 100F (37.8C) or more. In this case you need only supportive therapy, like drinking fluids like water or electrolyte beverages to prevent dehydration. Covering up with blanket to calm chills, resting a lot, gargling salt water to soothe a sore throat. To alleviate stuffy nose, sinuses, ears and chests, to reduce fevers and discomfort you can use decongestants and/ore antihistamines (e.g TAYLOL HOT which has has analgesic (pain relieving), antipyretic (reduce high body temperature), antihistamine (anti-allergic) effects) or other NSAID drugs. If your symptoms persist or are getting worse, than it is a possibility you might have a bacterial infection, for which you require broad spectrum antibiotic therapy. In your case you have also a bad earache, which can be a sign of acute inflammation of middle ear, so you probably need antibiotics and supportive therapy, but you should consult your family doctor and/or ENT doctor, in order to evaluate more objectively your situation. I hope my answer helped you.Wishing you a good health"},{"Patient":"1. What is the cause and treatment of candida infection? Is this a STD? 2. What is the cause and treatment of ecoli infection?

As you are reporting to have a history of toenails and if the applying Lamisil  reduces the tenderness and redness, then, most probably it might be due to fungal infection. It is common for fungal infection to be transferred from toenails to other parts of leg including groin. 3. I advise to: - keep good local hygiene- try to clean your hands each time you touch the tendered area and infected toenails- use warm water and soap to clean the area- dry well- apply betaine locally; let it dry- then, apply gentian violet solution locally; let it dry- then, apply Lamisil4.

Thank you for asking Healthcaremagic!I understand your concern dear!Answer: Genital herpes is usually treated with antiviral tablets, such as aciclovir.You will need to take a course of aciclovir for at least five days, or longer if you still have new blisters and open sores forming on your genital area. In a primary infection, mild local antiseptics such as potassium permanganate (KMnO4 lotion) diluted to 1/10 000 (pale pink), only a small amount applied twice a day for 10 minutes, may help to avoid super infection of the lesions.For the pain paracetamol or ibuprofen tablets are tipically recomended.

This is not because they are dangerous but rather for cosmetic reasons. Without surgical removal, sebaceous cyst usually come back. The best treatment is to ensure complete removal through surgery. You can consult a surgeon.After your cyst is removed, your doctor may give you an antibiotic ointment to prevent infection in the affected area.

As a result i got this breakout on legs that sat. evening. My question is do these two things have any thing in common. and how can i manage them...?","Doctor":"Hi & Welcome to HCM.I appreciate your concern for the Schramberg disease & hives.As such they are not related.Schamberg's disease is a chronic discoloration of the skin which usually affects the legs and often spreads slowly. It is caused by leaky blood vessels near the surface of the skin, capillaries, which allow red blood cells to slip through into the skin. The red blood cells in the skin then fall apart and release their iron which causes a rust color, this accounts for the orange tint of the rash.Hives (urticaria) are raised, often itchy, red bumps on the surface of the skin. They are usually due to an allergic reaction to food or medicine.When you have an allergic reaction to a substance, your body releases histamine and other chemicals into the blood. This causes itching, swelling, and other symptoms.There is no cure for Schamberg's disease; the itching can be controlled by a cortisone cream on the affected area.For hives treatment may not be needed if they are mild. They may disappear on their own. Avoid the triggers for the allergic reaction.To reduce itching and swelling:Do not take hot baths or showers.Do not wear tight-fitting clothing, which can irritate the area.An antihistamine like Diphenhydramine (Benadryl) may be effective.Hope this answers your query."},{"Patient":"Iv been with my girlfriend for over a year now and have only had intercourse with her.

The 1 i was picking at felt like a bump or lump under the skin. What could this be or is it an STD?","Doctor":"Hi,Welcome to HCM. I understand your concern.The lump you have got under the skin should not be a sign of STD. As you are describing, the lumps you are feeling with the ingrown hairs are most probaly due to the friction on the area as ell as can be due to the prolonged wetting also with the direct contact. It is kind of an allergic reaction of your skin against the discharge from vagina.There's no need to worry. You should keep the area clean and dry. And don't expose the are to friction as well. If you see the bumps growing, it can be sign of a pustule formation. In that case, you can take help of your physician who can incise and drain it if need be and cover up with antibiotics.Hope this helps."},{"Patient":"Good afternoon Dr.. I am suffering from skin allergy called Phemphigus vulgaris for last 6-8 months and still I am under medication only, I am taking Betnozol forte tablet for last 3 months. After taking this I am becoming very fatty, especially may face & stomach. Earlier my weight and height was 49-153 cm. Is there any side effects to take this medicine and kindly let me know how to reduce my weight.","Doctor":"I read your question carefully. I do understand your concern. Betamesathon is a corticosteroid. Like all corticosteroids, betamethasone affects your metabolism and how your body deposits fats. As a consequence, your appetite might increase leading to weight gain, especially to extra deposits of fat in your abdomen. ITo minimize this effect, watch your calories and exercise regularly. In general, your stomach will return to its normal size, 8-12 months after you discontinue steroids. Beside this, you should maintain adequate Vitamin D and Calcium intake through diet and supplement. You also should have a check up regarding osteoporosis risk assessment. The answer above was for the side effects of steroids in general and I'm not saying to stop the steroids (actually, stopping abruptly or tapering off to quickly you might experience withdrawal symptoms). Regarding pemphigus vulgaris infection, the first line treatment are corticosteroids. You should consult with your doctor about second-line therapies (azathioprine, rituximab, dapsone etc. ). You should also be careful regarding contact sports or any other activity that traumatize the skin.

I so hate being complicated and having to see so many doctors. My immunologist moved away some years ago and the one who replaced her won t see adults. However, the Hem/Onc doc I worked for agreed to oversee my care since the protocol was already in place. Thus, though I know he is a good doctor, I sometimes am afraid he may not be up to date on any new developments for PIDD. Thanks for your comments or reference materials.","Doctor":"Thank you for asking Healthcare majic. My name is Dr Ehsan Ullah & I have gone through your query.Primary immunodeficiency is a condition in which individuals are born missing some of the body's immune defences, which leaves them more susceptible to germs that can cause infections as compared to the general populations.Regarding information for the primary immune deficiency disorders, there is a list of such conditions which come under this category ... i just write here some names for your info like-Common Variable Immune Deficiency, -X-linked Agammaglobulinemia (Bruton's Disease), -Selective IgA Deficiency,-Severe Combined Immune Deficiency (boy-in-the-bubble disease). Some disorders are be quite common, occurring in as many as 1 in 500 to 1 in 1000 individuals, such as Selective IgA Deficiency . whereasOthers, such as Severe Combined Immune Deficiency, may be quite rare as one individual per million. IVIG have different indications in which they are used including your condition as PIDD .your concerns are right since you are worried about your immunologist which moved away but you should trust your current physician who as you mention your hem/onc doc .the most important aspect is thatUntreated primary immunodeficiencies may be characterized by frequent life-threatening infections and debilitating illnesses so do keep in tough with treating physician and if they will see some need for refferal then in such condition they do refer.

The most common infections would be Hepatitis B and HIV. Both of them have an incubation period of several months (a period when the pathogen is in the body but it is not still strong enough or in the right numbers as to cause clinical signs or symptoms). From the information you provided it is not clear as where the injection took place (health clinic, hospital etc). However, if your baby has been immunized from hepatitis B at birth and at 3rd and 6th month after birth, then he/she needs not to worry. Also, the risk of the needle being infected with HIV should be extremely low. Therefore your doctor is probably right and you do not need to worry.Best!"},{"Patient":"Hi, may I answer your health queries right now ?

Got off it.I am now taking acidophilus, enzymes and some    licorice, but still having pain which radiates from my back.   Any suggestions.","Doctor":"Hello and welcome to HCM!I read that you took prilosec (omeprazole), in order to reduce the pain caused by gastric acid. And then you took diflucan (fluconazole) but the symptoms got back once you stopped it. I would suggest to try taking itraconazole, which is the choice if fluconazole didn't work. However, ask your doctor if you can tolerate itraconazole. The standard regimen is 200 mg/day for about three weeks.Hope it helps and I wish you a quick recovery!"},{"Patient":"All most all hepatitis B positives are incidentally detected. Their parents are negative. Their age varies from infancy to 75+ None is iv drug abuser, none received blood transfusion, not all develop cirrhosis of HCC, Many lead asymptomatic life with normal LFT throuout life, The source of the entry of antigen remains unknown. Their spouses and children are negative, hence needless to say they receive hep B vaccinn Do they(i. Hep +ve ones) need eradication of the antigen?","Doctor":"Hello and welcome to HCM!Your question it is very interesting! I will try to summarize briefly the answer: of all persons contacting hepatitis B virus, 80-85% of them get healed spontaneously (the body's immune system reacts properly and the infection is eradicated), in 10-15% of cases the infection becomes chronic (asymptomatic carriers, resulting positive for the HBsAg surface antigen) and of the later, around 5% might end in cirrhosis or liver cancer. The asymptomatic carriers do not benefit much from being vaccinated against hepatitis B. Their treatment with interferon only in some cases will cause total remission, but in most cases only will lower slightly the HBsAg titer. In other words, interferon taking does not guarantee results and is expensive. On the other hand, the major part of asymptomatic carriers do not develop signs and symptoms of the disease. In this context, since vaccine is of no use and interferon is expensive and does not guarantee good results (meaning eradication of the antigen is nearly impossible), then the best thing to apply a healthy lifestyle as to not trigger the infection to get \\"active\\", by avoiding for example extensive use of alcohol etc. Hope this answer helped you!"},{"Patient":"Hi Im 19 years, im a male, uncircumcized and I have a yeast infection..

Excess smegma accumulation can cause recurrent yeast infections. You can clean the area with warm saline or just warm water. Avoid soaps and irritants on genital area as it can irritate more.

This is only on the top of my foot and no where else. This has never happened before. I also, due to this flu or whatever, woke up this morning with 2 cold sores.","Doctor":"With the fever, chills, and the swollen red foot, I would be very concerned about the possibility of cellulitis, an infection in the skin. Your body has been stressed from this, and that is why you developed cold sores, which are caused by a virus that becomes activated when your immune system is under stress from infection. This is something you need to have checked by a doctor right away, even if you are feeling better. The lack of feeling in your foot makes it difficult for you to judge how serious this could be. The infection could spread and get into your blood, so it's important to get it diagnosed and treated right away.

I hope that you're not suffering from any underlying cause as you've not mentioned (such as Diabetes).

You should keep the area dry constantly and should wear comfortable clothes which doesn't irritate the area or rubs against it.2. You should also take a notice of the size and color of the patch and not whether it is spreading, growing ar changing color.3. Considering the patch you mentioned is candida and you don't have any underlying conditions, I will suggest you to apply a cream with combination of antifugal clotrimazole and a steroid betamethasone.Apply the cream when you're home and take the ablove said precautions.It should help you in 10-15 days depending upon the size and thickness of the patch.If this is not helping you, i would suggest you to visit a qualified physician to make a clinical diagnosis and treatment.Hope this helps.Kind regards."},{"Patient":"I was with my five year old son in the hospital for two days - he has RSV.

Now that it has spontaneously drained, you are left with the cavity or cyst that contained the pus and blood with its opening at the skin surface. If all the infection and inflammation is gone, the cavity and the hole should heal up in a week or two. Keep it clean and watch for the redevelopment of infection.

It may be best to use only if testing such as a swab or blood test, confirms a bacterial infection. This would reduce the chance that you would develop antibiotic resistance.It may be a recurrent infection or post nasal drip may be contributing to your symptoms as well.The use of a topical steroid nasal spray such as nasocort, nasonex, flonase , may help.Oral gargles/sprays such as covonia or chloroseptic which contain a pain killer and antiseptic may also be important.I hope this helps"},{"Patient":"I have been taking the depo shot for about a year now.

She also has a blister at the bite site, when she busts this blister, it drains, then will be back in a few minutes. Ice did not seem to help. She does not have money to go to hospital, what can I do to help her?","Doctor":"Hello, Treatment for serious reactions to a black widow spider's bite will be beyond the scope of most medical offices and urgent care centers. Pain relief may require the use of narcotics and antivenin (antitoxin to counteract the effects of the spider venom).The decision to seek emergency care should be made early. If the person who was bitten by a black widow spider has more than minor pain or has whole-body symptoms, seek care at a hospital's Emergency Department. If symptoms are severe,  for emergency medical transport so that evaluation and treatment can start en route to the hospital.Home remedies for treatment of black widow spider bites are few. Hot and cold compresses are suggested remedies; as are baths with hot water. Over the counter medications for pain relieving are available and may be helpful in some minor cases. A paste of the content of charcoal capsules and water is believed by some people to be helpful in extracting the venom. A slice of potato may also be placed over the bite. Turmeric and olive oil applied to the bite may help to reduce the pain. Garlic and onion may also help to encourage recovery.

Please type your query here...Hi. for the last couple of days i have suffered from a sore throat, slight cough, aching neck, fatigue, breathlessness, dizziness, temperature, fever and fast pulse. What could this be?","Doctor":"Hello dear user!Thank you for using HCM for sharing your concerns!I've gone through your query and I understand your concerns.All these symptoms you are describing are indicative for an upper respiratory infection. It may be viral or bacterial and to determine this we have to do a complete blood count to see WBC.Fever, sore throat, cough are exclusively symptoms of an infection. Palpiations and fast heart rate is normal since you have fevers. Neck ache and hardening, dizziness, light intolerance, and red spots in chest or body are rarer symptoms that indicate a more severe condition and which must be treated immediately, and this is meningitis.I don't intend to worry you, and you should not do that, but some immediate things you should do for now is:- Go to your ER and do a complete blood count and leukocytes. If your WBC are high you have to take antibiotics and better injections of through your veins for a faster healing. If nothing suspicious for bacterial infection is found then you can stay home and take there your medications as described from your family doctor.I hope you will be better soon.I wish you a good health!DR ERIOL."},{"Patient":"hi..i am 25 years old weighing about 60 kg and 5ft 7 inches high.i am suffering from jaundice from last 15 days.my present bilirubin is 2.7 , just wanted to know could i start taking eggs and chicken which are cooked with very little oil and and less spicy.","Doctor":"Hello,the cause of this jaundice is more important than the symptom itself. It could be caused by various conditions - simple or more severe. Hepatitis is a common cause in young individuals but there are also benign causes like the Gilbert's syndrome (which does no harm at all) or genetic causes of hemolysis like heterozygous thalassemia that may also cause a mild elevation in bilirubin levels.So it all depends on the cause. You've got to investigate it with your doctor.

Hepatitis B & C Viruses spread by sharing the injection needles, blood transfusion or from mother to new born babies.Hepatitis A virus infection is characterized by loss of appetite, vomiting, abdominal pain, jaundice, etc. It usually subsides in 3-4 weeks of time and confer a prolonged immunity.Since it affects the liver hence symptoms like vomiting, burping, indigestion, heartburn are common which gradually disappear over a period of time.Meanwhile avoid hot and spicy foods, fatty meals, drugs, etc.Hope this answers your query."},{"Patient":"Hi , I'm 36 female.

I presume that you are speaking about Urinary tract Infection (UTI). If I am correct, then I would consider 2 years of infection to be a pretty long duration and there are certain things which needs to be done. First thing to do is a culture sensitivity test of the urine if not done recently after the last course of antibiotic. Secondly an ultrasound scan of the abdomen needs to be done to rule out any anatomical problems or deviations that is not letting the infection clear. The treatment is only antibiotics and based on the culture report and the clinical seriousness, your treating physician has to decide whether you need intravenous antibiotics. Meanwhile, kindly drink plenty of water and Cranberry juice is expected to help in UTI as well. Wishing you a speedy recovery.DR.

I would explain that considering his symptoms, it is important to investigate for possible cardiac arrhythmia, which can lead to this clinical situation. Other possible causes to consider would be: thyroid gland dysfunction, electrolyte imbalance, or chronic anemia. Anxiety may also mimic this clinical scenario. For this reason, I recommend consulting with his doctor and performing some tests: - a cardiac ultrasound - an ambulatory 24-48 hours ECG monitoring to investigate for cardiac arrhythmia - complete blood count for anemia - thyroid hormone levels for thyroid gland dysfunction - blood electrolytes for any possible imbalances.

WBC Count is 2.5, Lymph# 0.3 and platelet count is 79, Trophozoites of P. Vivax seen. I need to ask which medicine should i take which is safe and will no adverse effect on pregnancy/feotus......Aalia from Mumbai","Doctor":"Dear Aalia, HiWelcome to HCM.I appreciate your concern for the safety and effective drugs for malaria during pregnancy.Chloroquine is the safest drug to be used to treat P. vivax infection during pregnancy. However in case of Chloroquine resistance, Quinine and Clindamycin combination is the most effective treatment option another option is use of Mefloquine.The parasites (hypnozoites) of P Vivax remain dormant in the liver as they  are not killed by any of the above medications and thus responsible for relapse of the malaria, so Primaquine is used to eradicate those hypnozoites. Since Primaquine is contraindicated during pregnancy. Chloroquine is given  once weekly for the duration of  pregnancy for prevention of relapse of malaria.  After delivery, the patient should be treated with Primaquine once daily for 14 days. Before starting the treatment with Primaquine G6PD status should be confirmed as Primaquine is known to cause severe hemolysis in patients with G6PD deficiency.In addition to the above medications, Paracetamol can be used to treat fever and  iron and folic acid supplementation as a part of routine antenatal care should be continued.Hope the treatment options given above could be useful in the treatment of P vivax malaria during and after the pregnancy.Rate this answer, if you are convinced."},{"Patient":"I have pain, tender to touch and what seems to be a soft cyst on my xiphoid process.

Your cyst is unlikely due to viral infection but if at all there is a cyst a Abdominal CT would have picked it up. So I feel there is no cyst .      Elevated labs related to pancreas indicates Pancreatitis . For this you need to be nil by mouth for 2 days . In that case you need to get admitted to hospital and get IV fluids .

I have no pain and have already been on antibiotics and nothing is clearing this up..I have been hospitalized 3 times in the past 2 months because they have turned into kidney infections and have become very ill..","Doctor":"You don't state your gender, but I am presuming female and my answer relates to women. You might have a vaginal infection. That could cause a discharge with a funny smell, which would cause the urine to become cloudy. If the routine antibiotics used for previous UTIs haven't worked, then I would start thinking it was related to the genital tract. Bacterial vaginosis is a common vaginal infection that can cause a painless vaginal discharge. To be sure, you would need a vaginal exam with microscopic analysis of the discharge. You might also consider a clean catch urine for culture and sensitivity. If you have developed a resistant urinary tract bug, the antibiotics you've used in the past may not be helpful, and this test can diagnose the bacteria and what they're sensitive to for antibiotics. Hope this answers your question."},{"Patient":"hey i am 19 and have some yellowish growths under the rim of my penis i not so sure how to decribe them. i have had them for about two years now but to embaressed to go to a gp. they do not cause any discomfort but they can some times smell. i have tryed to burst them but they do not. its like they are just  bits of skin and they painfull when lots of pressure is put on them. any ideas??thanks","Doctor":"HiThank you for asking HCM.I have gone through your query. If you send a picture of it then it will be more helpful in identifying. It can be fungal infection or warts. Do you had any history of unprotected sexual intercourse? In case of fungal infection anti fungal creams like miconazole will be helpful. But if warts it can be removed by applying podofillin or by freezing with liquid nitrogen. This should be done by a dermatologist.Hope this may help you.

I understand the reluctance, but it sounds like his finger is infected and it will only get worse. You can't be sure the antibiotics you have would be appropriate for this type of infection. In addition, infection in closed spaces like the finger often require the injury to be opened to drain the infection. Antibiotics alone won't cure it. If it continues to spread, it could get into the blood or could cause damage to local bone and tendon, which could cause disability in the future. Plus if he hasn't had a tetanus shot in awhile, he might need one. So best to be seen promptly. Hope this helps."},{"Patient":"Hi,I was wondering why the cuts that I have smell sweet?I am going to explain everything here and be completely honest.

They smell like Iron and something really sweet.","Doctor":"Some infectious bacteria can cause a sweet or fruity odor. One type is called Pseudomonas. This type can be very difficult to treat. You don't mention other symptoms suggesting infection, but I would be very concerned that this may be developing. If you are having any discharge, redness, swelling, tenderness, or sensation of heat in the area where you cut, go to emergency now and be sure it's not an infection developing. Blood could give an iron smell also, although you don't mention any current bleeding. Safest to have a doctor take a look and be sure nothing serious is starting to develop.

Rat bite can cause bacterial infections. So it should be washed thoroughly with soap and water and apply antiseptics. Tetanus prophylaxis should be taken. Antibiotics will be needed also. This treatment you can get in government hospital for free in bangalore. In private hospital also the whole treatment will be within 500 rupees. Antirabies prophylaxis is not given for small rats. Hope this may help you. Let me know if anything not clear.Thanks."},{"Patient":"Hello Doctors, My step mother is suffereing from fever from past 3 months she did went through with all kind of blood test, scanning from different doctors in hopitals and clinics finally at seventh day adventist hospital said she has the initial stage of TB,She is getting weak, losing her weight and she is also a patient of high blood pressure as well.

Please type your query here... Iam 21 aged 160 and59kg .dog bite me before 1 month before and i taken 3 injection aswell,since last 3 days i am having cold .whether any relation with dog bite and what is the starting if infected","Doctor":"Hello,      Welcome to HCM and thanks for asking your question. I will do my best to resolve your query.      I would like to tell you that as you had dog bite 1 month before and at present you are having cold, so in that case in my opinion, there is no any direct or indirect relation between dog bite and cold. Also you had taken rabies vaccine, so it will never cause cold after 1 month, so get that point.      Your cold might be due to any viral or allergic reaction, so take plenty of fluids, avoid spicy and outside food, take antihistaminic drug. You can also consult your local doctor, if cold does not go away within a week or so.      Hope this answers your questions and let me know if you have any further relevant queries, i will be happy to guide you in right direction."},{"Patient":"i noticed that my butt hole is bleeding when i wipe it, even if i didnt poop. it hurts a little to sit down but this just started happening. about a week ago my boyfriend put a small vibrator in my anus but idont understand why it would start bleeding NOW its been a week... what could be the problem?","Doctor":"Hello,It could be that you have a hemorrhoid that got inflamed with the vibrator.

You can wash the area with soap and water and apply ice pack of pain relief. Over the counter analgesics can be used in case of more pain. Tetanus toxoid should be taken for prophylaxis. You should also check your BP and pulse rate. In case of any discomfort approach ER.  Clotting time and bleeding time should be measured. Spiders like black widow can cause adverse reactions.

I'll try to give my help as much as possible.It seems you have an upper respiratory tract infection. Having cough, and voice changes indicates that you larynx is under inflammation too.If you have other symptoms like high temperature, pain in chest or back under the shoulder blades, weakness, muscles ache, and similar to these, you have to start as soon as possible an antibiotic cure, to treat the infection and prevent complications.I would recommend you azithromycin once daily, Ibuprofen for the fevers if you have, for the pain and inflammation, vitamin c to help you recover quicker. Have a balanced diet, and drink a lot of liquids to keep your body hydrated and ease the healing.If things are getting worse and you don't see any improvement please consult your doctor in your healthcare center, to see if you have any severe cold or pneumonia.I hope you will be fine soon.I wish you all the best!DR ERIOL"},{"Patient":"I got a horse fly bite and there are two underneath my right arm and two on the back of my right arm.

Could this  indicate another condition  like multiple sclerosis ?","Doctor":"Hello,you haven't provided enough information but I'll try to explain the situation to you. Regarding serologic testing (EBV): IgM means recent infection. The IgM antibodies may remain positive many months after being exposed to the virus. IgG is the \\"chronic\\" antibody which may remain positive for years. IgG positive with IgM negative means old infection. Your trouble with the words and the lower eyelid do not seem to have any connection to the EBV. You haven't mentioned your age which is a very important piece of information. Forgetfulness might be the first sign of dementia. The eye twitching can be caused by disease like multiple sclerosis although this is not a very common presenting sign. We definitely don't diagnose multiple sclerosis on that ground only!I hope I've clarified the situation a bit!You can contact me again, if you'd like to ask for clarifications or further information.Kind Regards!"},{"Patient":"29 yr old male, fever (highest was yesterday with 102.9) now it's been around 101.6 when I take tylenol or motrin.

Pneumonia is characterized by high temperature dyspnoea cough and chest pain. Your problem can be most likely due to upper respiratory infection. As it is greenish mucus bacterial infection will be present. So better approach your GP for antibiotic therapy. I usually give antibiotic Co-amoxiclav for such case.

Often the wound seems to close almost instantly. But this doesn't mean treatment isn't necessary. The rusty nail injury you sustained can be dangerous because of the risk of tetanus infection.If you have't had a tetanus shot in the past five years you need to take  a booster dose of Injection Tetanus toxoid within 48 hours of the injury.Hope this answers your query."},{"Patient":"i am a 46 year old female 5 ft 7 weigh 120lbs i am continually having finger nail infections where the nail turns white and red and sore below nail bed i am treating it with polyfax ointment and daktacort cream prescribed by my doctor but not having great results any suggestions would be welcome tks","Doctor":"HiWelcome to HCM.I appreciate your concern for the finger nail infection.Apparently you have some sort of fungal finger nail infection which usually does not respond to Daktacort cream or Polyfax ointment.You need to be examined by a dermatologist for probable use of Oral Anti-fungal drugs like Terbinafine or  Itraconazole. It may take four months or longer to eliminate an infection. So you have to take these medications  for a period of  6-12 weeks. Medicated nail polish containing Ciclopirox is also effective. You have to paint it on your infected nails and surrounding skin once a day. After seven days, you wipe the piled-on layers clean with alcohol and begin fresh applications. You may need to use this type of nail polish daily for a year.Hope the suggestions given above could be beneficial to you.Best regards."},{"Patient":"My brother age 74has endured the bentall procedure barely escaping dying......he is in icu now for 3 weeks having suffered various setbacks.

After about a month it got infected and at the same time I noticed that the piercing was rejecting, even though I put a lot of effort into cleaning it. The infection never went away. This past weekend on Saturday, the piercing was at the stage where I could see about half of the metal bar of the piercing. While it was still infected and in the process of rejection, I had a really bad fall, made a wrong move and I felt the rest of the piercing rip out. Even though I knew I was going to lose the piercing I was going to keep it in until the infection went away so that I didn't get an abscess. Well, the piercing came out and since then (about 5 days ago) I've been cleaning it and putting Neosporin on it with a band aid. It is not getting better. every time I change the band-aid there is a lot of pus, although the wound seems more or less closed. It is very painful, red, and appears to be a small bubble. I am worried that this is an abscess and I don't know how to get it under control. I don't want it to get to the point where I need an operation and I know that if it is left for too long they can even be fatal.

I am not sure whether I am responding to the treatment or not. Please let me know how long it takes for lymph nodes to go back to its normal size?","Doctor":"hello sir. I did review your concern.This is a very difficult question to answer. Generally with proper treatment the tuberculous lymphnode shrinks in size, but if it has already become fibrotic and calcified as seen with chronic lesion of tuberculosis, it does not shrink to its normal size and takes years to get normal in size.But the important thing is that, with proper treatment these lymphnodes although look slightly big they are treated microbiologically and pathologically. so there is nothing to worry about. They contain fibrosis and old granulomas and some calcified material which is noninfective.My advice would be to continue regular tuberculosis treatment for designated 6 months period and in most case scenario it will shrink.I hope this helps.Thank you for using healthcaremagic.Wish you all the best."},{"Patient":"Hi Doctor, I'm 35 years old and an asian.

Since there he has been bit by bugs thought to be bed bugs initially, then deemed to be another bug (not sure air fleas, sand fleas) leaving bumps the turned red and itched like crazy  Then he was stung by something on the side of his neck right over his gland just under his ear.  The bite stung for 45 mins and swelled up enough for people to notice it and comment on it. Then he got a swollen gland that did not go away with antibiotics.  The Dr did a needle biopsy and wasn't happy with the results.  He was then sent to have the gland removed and that sent for a biopsy. We are waiting on results now. Then obvious first assumption is lymphoma.  My question is can all the venom from the incidents also make the gland swell and not got down or disappear with the use of antibiotics?  I am so hoping this could be the reason for the gland issue rather than the other.  He told the Dr but he still went on with the gland removal. Maybe he was just airing om the safer side removing it.","Doctor":"Hi,I would need further specific details to answer your question but however with the currently available details I would try and help you out.Yes, It is possible for a gland to swell up after multiple insect bites. It can persist for longer if there is some local infection in the bite site. It can persist even with use of antibiotics when the infection is resistant to that antibiotic given. So some more information needed to answer this question are whether the doctor tried more than one course of antibiotic. Secondly, If it is a lymphoma, the gland usually does not swell up in a very short duration unless there was a small lymphoma which suddenly enlarged in size due to some RARE complication in the tumour. If that was so then the gland should have been painful and red. was it the case?If your answer to that question was \\"He was all normal till insect bite and suddenly there was a large swelling of the gland\\" - then its most likely that its not lymphoma"},{"Patient":"sudden sharp pain like wasp sting or spider bite. shoes on at time,  dark blue discoloration of toe at joint beneath toe gradually spreading to neighboring toes as if briuised  - pain was transitory not due to impact or stress, not tender to touch, no visible punctures, not distended or firm,","Doctor":"Pain and dark blue discolouration of toe suggests decreased blood flow to that part and as a result poor oxygen supply to the nerves and tissues there.

Sometimes 150-155/67-77. Better (normal) for me is 145/70 (+/- 2 points either way on both readings). My best readings will be in the mid 130s/high 60s. Thought the higher diastolic was due to the wall thickening that developed during the stenosis. Cardiologist says that s not the case and wants to take me off of altace (rose dose from 2.5 mg to 20 mg, 9+ years ago as the systolic began to rise due to the then moderate stenosis, which became severe and eventually required valve replacement).

If you had uploaded the lab test and X-ray report and particularly the CT scan, it would have been very helpful. A very high C-reactive protein for example is a sign of ongoing bacterial infection that hasn't been treated properly. Other signs that may predict a bad outcome include a low oxygen saturation, increased number of breaths per minute (particularly when they are more than 30), more than one site of infection on the CT or X-ray, comorbidities, a very fast heart rate, etcSo you understand that a lot of important data are lacking for me to give you a more specific answer.

Pain in and around joints is common following Viral infection . It can last for 2 weeks to 4 months. This pain will gradually come down . If pain is bothering he can use Paracetamol .     But it is the swelling that needs more evaluation. It could be due to abnormal blood circulation in the legs for example Varicose veins. I recommend you to get Venous doppler of your husband's legs which will confirm our diagnosis and also let us know the severity. Kindly revert back with reports.     Hope this information was useful to you.     Any clarifications feel free to ask ."},{"Patient":"My daughter was bitten by a dog that has been vaccinated for rabies. The wound was cleaned and it skin was bruised and it healed and she has only mark where the tooth cut the flesh. She is healthy last 5 months since bite, but it ithces some times. What must I do, or is it nothing ?","Doctor":"Hi,   I understand your concern.   Your daughter has ocassional itching over the scar of a dog bite, It can be due to possible scar condition called scar- where it overgrows to form a thick scar. If there is no such thickening till now -      - Avoid itching at the site, for itching stimulates keloid formation.      - Apply steroid ointment ,   If it does not stop itching,& starts thickening, injecting steroid at the scar site/ excision of keloid ( by external beam radio therapy/ Cryotherapy) is the last resort for it. consult a surgeon for that.   Thanks."},{"Patient":"In October I went to the doctor for a yeast infection. They took a swab and said I tested positive for yeast. They prescribed me diflucan. The medication worked. In December my symptoms reappeared. I was prescribed a second round of diflucan. This did nothing to relieve my symptoms. I self treated with yogurt and a vaginal steroid to restore ph. It did relieve the itching and irritation. But I still went back to the doctor. She told me to keep doing what I was doing and scheduled me to see my OBGYN in 3 weeks. I have been told to use Rephresh gel applicators and was prescribed a steroid cream. I still have my symptoms external itching and my skin is very dry. Any suggestions in how to get through the next few weeks until my appointment with the OBGYN?","Doctor":"Hi,   I have read your query & realize your concern. *  Yeast infection  is associated with  white /curd like vaginal discharge & is  notorious to recur, unless treated adequately.Mostly it is sexually transmitted problem,so treatment of both sex partners ( both oral & local treatment)is advised- till the infection is completely eradicated.   The infection tends to recur- so abstinance & repeated therapy is given to remove the infection en root.  *  The recent itching you have does not seem to have any discharge( as you say skin is dry). Still vaginal swab testing should be done before treating it for yeast..  *   In some conditions like  Allergy,antibiotic consumption, hormonal therapy, pregnancy, menopause, diabetes HIV .. disturb normal vaginal flora & causes dryness & itching.    I As there is no response to normal yeast medications, these factors need to be considered/ excluded/ treated along with yeast treatment.    Thanks."},{"Patient":"I was stung by a small scorpion in the Philippines (near Puerto Galera).  The scorpion stung me on the underside ball of my foot.  The area has swelled and the skin has turned a light purple color.  The scorpion was approximately 1 inch long and semi-transparent.  The incident occurred 3 days ago.  What should I do as a medical follow-up?","Doctor":"hello there,Scorpion stings are managed well with a local application of a baking soda (NAHCO3) paste to neautralise the acid in its venom.You can have tab cetrizine once a day for 3 days and also take Crocin 500 m.g twice a day after food for 3 days to manage the pain and tingling.Sometimes the scorpion's stinger may get embedded in your skin. In such cases you may need to visit a doctor and get it removed. The way to tell if its embedded is if you have no relief of symptoms even after applying the soda paste and taking the drugs.Hope this helps,please feel free to address any further queries to me, I would gladly answer them"},{"Patient":"Hi I have ebv (Epstein barr virus), low platelets, low vitamin d, very Nevada s joint pain, also including fatty liver disease, high bad cholesterol, slightly high glucose, my doctor is awful and said I m fine but I know I m not my sister has lupus my grandma has diabetes and we have severe tumors in our family including celiac disease please tell me what kind of doctor I should go see","Doctor":"Hi I did review your concern.EBV infection generally has no antibiotic or antiviral treatment.

I can give you recommendations for rabies vaccinations as they are done in the United States according to the Centers for Disease Control here.There are a total of 4 rabies vaccine injections, on days 0, 3, 7, 14.  So there is one more injection of vaccine you will need.Here we also recommend one dose of rabies immune globulin (RIG) in addition to the rabies vaccine.  Rabies immune globulin is not a vaccine.  It is an injection of antibodies to the virus itself.  It should be given at the site of the attack and any remaining volume of the injection should be given IM (in a muscle) at a site distant from where the vaccine is given. Also, RIG should not be administered in the same syringe as vaccine. Because RIG might partially suppress production of antibody, no more than the recommended dose should be given. The CDC recommends that people be given RIG even if initial treatment with it has been delayed.Here is a link to their information:   hope this information is helpful."},{"Patient":"My chest hurts and I have body aches, pain in the back of my shoulder blade at times.

She was wearing jeans while this was happening, but after about 20-30 seconds I had her get off of me since my penis was exposed and her crotch area seemed moist. Also, she licked and kind of bit on my nipples off and on for about 1-2 minutes. Furthermore, she fingered herself while laying on her back a few minutes later as I pulled, kissed, and tugged at her nipples with my mouth until she climaxed. But I refused to finger her, although she did lick both of her wet fingers after fingering herself a few times. I just don't remember if she played with her nipples with her fingers during the encounter, which makes me nervous because I am afraid I might've opened a channel for possible transmission by licking and sucking on her nipples. Also, when I pinched her nipples, I may have had cracked skin on my fingers, given how cold it has been in the Upper Midwest this week. I should also note that I have a broken tooth that has been filled until I get a root canal, and that I am going to the dentist next week to finish a root canal that they began last month on another tooth. Needless to say, I am scared of exposure through those channels as well. I also started thinking to myself that she might have fingered herself prior to my arrival at her home, and, perhaps she stroked my erect penis with the same hand unwashed. Obviously, the penis does have a hole. When she stroked me, I don't remember any pre-cum/cum, but it may have been there in microscopic amounts. She also told me last night that she last tested for HIV in March 2014, was negative, and that she only engaged in sexual activities with one other person since then, but I'm not certain what they did. Am I at risk of contracting HIV from the above practices, and when is the earliest that I can be tested?

I was vaccinated with BCG when i was baby because i am from KSA.Is there any possibility of return to active TB when my immunity suppressed?? Is the bacilli completly killed with treatment??","Doctor":"HiThanks for your query.I appreciate your concern for the after effects of TB.Here are the answers for your query:1. Orange red discoloration of the urine was the side effect of one of the drugs ( Rifampicin) used in the treatment of TB, it is a harmless reaction, it is not due to disseminated TB to the kidney, neither it can cause infertility by itself.2. Tuberculin test if done now may show a positive reaction indicating the past infection or BCG vaccination.3.TB may occur if you are exposed to an open case of TB or if your immunity is suppressed.4.

However, in case of Plasmodium vivax infection the parasites remain dormant in the liver for longer period of time, they are not killed by Quinine or other antimalarial drugs, hence responsible for the the recurrent infection and thus fever.To eradicate/kill these parasites (hypnozoites) another medication Primaquine has to be taken orally for a period of 14 days.

His most recent scan showed his spleen back to normal. His white blood count was low, and he had ketones in his urine. His dr. said he just had a virus. His only symptoms have been tiredness, asthma symptoms, and headaches off and on, and he is pale. No sore throat, or cough, or runny nose. Should I keep pressing the dr to run more tests? Could this still be a long lasting virus? What kinds of things should I have him tested for? We live in a very small town, with only one pediatrician, and I don't have a whole lot of confidence in him. Please help!!","Doctor":"My first thought is that he might have infectious mononcleosis. This is a viral infection that is long lasting, causes fatigue, can cause spleen enlargement and low white count. Similar viruses may do the same. There are blood tests for infectious mono that you could ask the doctor to run. I would also request a complete blood count (CBC) to see if he's anemic, since you mention he looks pale. This may have been done already, since a white cell count is part of a CBC. The ketones may be related to not eating well, but they can appear in the urine with the onset of diabetes. It is very important that he have a blood sugar done to be sure this hasn't developed. Insulin diabetes not uncommonly develops after an acute viral infection in a young person that just doesn't seem to get better. It is the diabetes starting that causes the persistent symptoms. Getting the blood tests suggested should help rule out some serious conditions. Hope this helps."},{"Patient":"hello, i just found out i have hsv2. i just had a baby 3 months ago. i had prenatal care the entire time. how is it possible they wouldnt have seen it? i never recall experienceing a breakout. if hsv2 is dormant will it show up on a blood test? and what exactly does equivocal may suggest early infection me. does this mean that i just contracted it?

It is so weird b/c since I was young I had 2-5 strep ouinfections a year but since that last crazy infection - NONE!  Also about a month or so after the last infection I noticed somewhat of a whitish/grey spot (about a 1/2 inch in size) on my right tonsil, not concerned I just thought it was maybe scar tissue or something.  Recently, I noticed the whitish area has turned a purplish/black color.  Any thoughts?  I have a history of smoking - should I be worried or no.   There is no pain surrounding the area, just an abnormal color.","Doctor":"Hi I did review your concernI would advice you to consult a ENT doctor and get the lesion evaluated. the purple lesion which is localized can be anything from a blood vessel problem to that of melanocytes. common lesions that can present like this include smokers melanosis (since you have smoking habit) and also hemangioma(blood vessel prolferation) or nevus.The doctor will examine it clinically and if required will take a tiny biopsy to rule out anything worrisome.I would meanwhile recommend you to quite smoking as best as you can.I hope this helpsWish you all the best.Thank you for using healthcare magic."},{"Patient":"im a 18 year old Female, and ive been having a 100.0 - 103.8 fever, neck stiffness, pulsing headache when i move my head or eyes, a swollen throat and ear pain, have not been passing stool, and get extremly sharp pain in my left side when breathing deeply. my docter said it was nothing but i do not believe them.","Doctor":"Hi,From history it seems that you might be having acute upper respiratory tract infection giving rise fever, stiff neck, headache, sinus headache and radiating pain in ear.you might require one antibiotic medicine course like Amoxicilin or Azithromicie for 3-5 days.Take ibuprofen for fever and pain.Avoid cold drinks and junk food.Ok and take care."},{"Patient":"I have had a head cold for three weeks now, (they usually only last a week for me) mostly just stuffy runny nose, but no sore throat... and have taken over the counter decongestants, and even tried allergy antihistamines in case it is my hayfever allergy and after a quick doctor visit a 3days course of what I think were antibiotics... (I live in china ;) All to no noticeable effect. Yesterday I awoke with swollen glands in my neck and a painful bump in my groin area between leg and abdomen (first time that's ever happened). Is that just part of the cold progressing to lymph system?","Doctor":"There few reasons for for swollen glands ,the most common is an infection. However, most of the time when we take antibiotics and does not improve, it could be secondary to viral infection, as mononucleosis, Cytamegalovirur. Other possibilities are parasites or non infectious as lymphoma and leukemia.

You definitely need a tetanus shot if you have not had one in the last 5 years. If the puppy is not sick and has not been exposed to rabies then you probably do not need to rabies vaccine.

Are there any new drugs that I can look forward trying as I have tried telepraver and RIBA virin and interferon and it nearly killed me. Thank You Doctor for your time. My e-mail is YYYY@YYYY","Doctor":"A new drug combination recently came out that does not require the use of interferon or ribavirin. It's once a day, minimal side effects, and has a very high cure rate. The only problem is that it's extremely expensive, and only approved for treatment of genotype 1. The combination is of 2 drugs called ledipsavir and sofosbuvir. The brand name of the combination is Harvoni. I believe there is another combination coming out soon or may actually be approved by now. But in any case, there are choices to anticipate very soon. Check with a liver specialist or the doctor who treated you before and get started on the improved meds. Hope this helps."},{"Patient":"I was recently diagnosed with bacterial Pneumonia, in addition I had a severe bladder infection last month that went untreated for 2weeks.  In researching the cause of my Pneumonia online, I came across a specific bacteria found in kidney infections that can migrate to the lungs in severe cases, causing Pneumonia. I can't seem to find the article again where I found this information, and would really like to know the name of this bacteria, I have a feeling my bladder infection that went untreated for 2 weeks my have been the root cause of my pneumonia.  Please help.","Doctor":"Many different types of bacteria can cause both pneumonia and a bladder infection. It is very possible that some of the bacteria from your bladder got out into your blood and were carried to your lungs to cause the pneumonia. You might also have gotten 2 different types of bacteria in each area just coincidentally. Some of the bacteria that can cause both UTIs and pneumonia include E. coli, Klebsiella, Pseudomonas, Enterococcus, Staphylococcus and more. In fact, most common bacteria have the potential to cause infection in both areas. So I can say yes, it's very possible your untreated UTI was the cause of your pneumonia, but only cultures from both areas could prove whether it was the same bacteria. Hope this helps."},{"Patient":"Hi, I am having a terrible chesty cough for two weeks. my nose is dry but I am coughing up green phlem constantly.  the cough is  driving me crazy as I can't sleep, don't feel like eating and my head hurts. I have drunk gallons of water and soup. do I have a chest infection? please help.","Doctor":"You could have a chest infection. It could be bronchitis or even pneumonia. It's also possible you have a sinus infection with the drainage going down into your chest and creating the chesty cough. Sometimes people can develop an asthma-like picture after a viral upper respiratory infection which is mostly coughing rather than wheezing. Most viral respiratory infections should clear up within 10 days or so. Since it's been 2 weeks and not getting better, you should consider seeing your doctor and get examined for these possibilities. Appropriate treatment can then be selected- at least a cough suppressant to help with your symptoms, if nothing else. Hope this helps."},{"Patient":"Hello. :)  I just went to a house with my friend.  There were lots of people.  This guy gave me a hug that i met (dont remember if he touched my hands). I then later got a litttle random natural itch and went to bathroom to scratch my self down there.  haha it was a good close scratch. Thing is i didnt wash my hands first not thinking (not thinking)!!!  Then coming out of washroom i noticed the guy i hugged had oral herpey on his lip.  So the thing is i just dont recall if he had shortly touched his sore.  Then possible touched my hand then me putting my hands down my pants to scratch my genitals about 40 mins later.  Also i hear hes had the out break for over a week, so im not sure if it is still extremely contagious??. Do you believe there would of be any chance i could of cought it from his hands to my hands then to my genitals????     Thank you sooo much!","Doctor":"It's very unlikely the virus would be transmitted that way, although not entirely impossible. If the lesions were scabbed over, they probably weren't particularly contagious. People touch their faces many times a day, so it's possible he touched the lesions but if he only gave you a hug, he probably didn't touch your hands. Even then, that type of contact from lips to hands to your hands to your genitals is not likely to pass the virus. It's direct contact you'd have to worry about- for instance, if he had given you oral sex. So you are okay and don't need to worry about this.

Three days later while in hospital, the doctor came to tell me I was positive, her attending colleague came to see me shortly after and told me not to get upset to worried, the test wasn t positive, it was inconclusive.

I was released a week later and continued to go for my weekly shots. Within three months my syphilis went from 1:32 to 1:2, the doctors themselves couldn t believe how rapidly my system had fought the syphilis (it apparently takes up to two years), while at home I did another two swab tests which returned negative results. I did another follow up blood test, four months after my stay in hospital and the result is still inconclusive, the doctors just say there is a problem with my blood and the amount of antibodies but cannot seem to see what it is.
